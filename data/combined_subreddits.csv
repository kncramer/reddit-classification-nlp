Better late than never... finally read the ACOTAR series and SJM is a lazy writer,"I hear a hoard of angry ACOTAR fans enter my thread, they stumble into my post, tripping over each other as  they hurl vulgar gestures at me. 

The angriest looking one slams the door behind them. Perhaps they've come to mist me. But they stop their frenzy short, surprised to find my steady gaze looking elsewhere, my focus lost somewhere beyond them, beyond this world. I wait, picking my nails, for their breathing to even out. Am I truly not scared of them? I suppose after finishing this series can I no longer feel anything through my disappointment.

“Hater!” One cries out by way of greeting. I pick an invisible speck of dust.

""Welcome"" I say by way of greeting. I stand to face them. I said what I said.

“Did we ever even find out WHAT a ‘vulgar gesture’ might represent? Do you not find it a bit annoying that after being mentioned once, said 'gesture' can’t be described... a *little* more more creatively?"" Their blinks are the only thing that gives them away. Maybe they feel the pain I am feeling too.

""Think about it."" I say, picking my nails. ""This is a book that is perfectly fine outlining every graphic step of getting dicked down-again and again- but she can't describe just how vulgar this gesture really is? And we let this lazy writing slide?”   
  
“And seriously, why in cauldrons name is it always “Picking their nails?” Is there truly NO other physical tell an author could use? Not one? How many different characters, personalities is this really realistic for? Do we think haughty, vain Amarantha would really be caught dead picking her nails, let alone in front of her prisoners under the mountain? No! I know for sure Nesta wouldn’t be caught doing something so unladylike. And we all know for a fact that Amren wouldn’t ever feel bad enough about doing something to be guilty, let alone act nervous- And she somehow picks her nails the most.""

I shake my head to clear it. If I shake it enough, maybe i'll concuss myself into forgetting that 'shaking one's head to clear it' is my biggest book character pet peeve. ""Anyway, I’m glad you all stopped to think this through before tearing me to bloody ribbons. ""Because Mother knows there’s not 1,000 other ways to describe gore,"" I say under my breath. With that, I pick another invisible speck of lint, and walk out.

\[TLDR; Lazy writing will be the death of me and I know SJM or her editors or publishers can do better. But deep down, in all seriousness I love this series, I read it 2x-3x over the last month. I am so SALTY about all this because for my taste, what I like to read, and what I want out of a reading experience -  I know this series could have been a 10/10 but this easily fixable stuff kept yanking me out of the books.\]

Romantic fantasy novel for a husband and wife to read together.,"Hello everyone, for our 5th wedding anniversary I brought the idea to my wife that we read a book together. We are both big readers and each love fantasy settings in our books. 

However, while the style of books we like is very similar, there seems to be less crossover in the actual books we read. I'm a big Sanderson fan, high fantasy with a lot of world building, and she likes Sarah J Maas, Stephanie Garner, etc. Primarily Romantasy novels.

Romance is not my typical genre but I do enjoy romantic tension in my books. I enjoy both male and female POVs (I really like powerful boss chicks as main or side characters). I love intricate magic systems, battle and fight scenes, character development, and so on.

My wife likes all these things as well, though prefers more time on plot and characters over world building. She started mistborn on my recommendation and liked the vibe, but felt it spent too much time developing the world rather than the plot and characters in the early sections of the book. She really enjoys romance, not as much ""smut"" but more back and forth tension (think pride and prejudice). She will skip past really steamy parts in books. Female POV is her preference;  she likes strong willed battle babes like I do.

What books can you recommend for us to enjoy together? We're both happy to step out of our comfort zones a bit for a great book.",fantasy

Kingdom of the Wicked Trilogy… Spoilers ahead ,"KotW Trilogy wrap up…

It seemed like the ending to this book and trilogy were rushed and all over the place. I was left with more questions than answers. Spoilers ahead- 

The entire ending was anti-climatic. What was the purpose of focusing so much on a “suspected attack” from the starlight witches only for them not to attack again at all?

Also you mean to tell me Emilia was so brilliant throughout the first two books. She was able to put so much together through investigation and sheer cunning just to not be able to figure out a way to keep her magic???

Where was greed during the post coronation party? 

How did Sofia get her memories back?and what was the point of the memories returning?

Did Celestia ever get her spell book back? 

Did Lucia ever chose to use the memory stone?

Who was behind the assassination attempt on Emelia when she was in the bath?

Who took Victoria’s diary and destroyed all her things? And why?

Antonio admits to killing the witches but doesn’t remember removing their hearts. He claims to have been under the influence of an “angel of death”. We later found out that Vittoria was behind the young witches murders. Does this mean that Vittoria removed her own heart? If not who was it? The book makes it seem like it was someone other than vittoria. Vittoria says “there were many demons in line to remove her heart” but she does not answer Emilia’s direct question of WHO it was. 

Who was behind slitting Nonnas throat? I know Emilia’s part of the horns was found with the shifters but as far as I understand they can’t make themselves invisible. 

In the one of the first two books Claudia is found outside the monastery insane and rambling. Emelia suspects what happened to her haunt happened to her. That her mind had gotten stuck between realms while scrying. In the 3rd book Emelia goes to Claudia for the blade of ruination. Yet, somehow Claudia is completely coherent again. What was the point of making her go insane? Nothing is explained as to why she lost her mind and then magically has it back again?

Over all this last book was so damn frustrating. It definitely ruined the series for me",fantasy

Books you'd rather see as a movie and not a show,"I'm sure this has been brought up before but I've never seen it so I'm posting the question anyway!

What books do you think would be better to have as a movie and why? Not all stories need 8 or more hours to be able to make a good adaptation and if anything would be better with a movie.

Personally, I feel like ""Kings of the Wyld"" would make for an amazing movie. The story is pretty short and sweet and doesn't have a ton of plot lines to track or take up extra time. Plus the comedic tone, in my very limited opinion, would work better overall in a movie than a TV show given how dark so many other subjects can be. But what do I know?

Gritty violent books with FMC *and* mostly female villains?,"The title says it all. One of the things I enjoy in fantasy is seeing badass women (ideally somewhat eroticized, but not necessary) in the usual male roles. But often it's just one token female character. Even if she's the main character, usually the narrative is still overall male.

Some themes would lend themselves to this - like Amazon or Gladiatrix-inspired stories, but I'm open to anything (including those).",fantasy

Looking for some character (MC) driven story recs,"Hi, so I read books for the characters rather than the story itself. Of course, story being good is a bonus but what I really search for in a book is a good protagonist (as well as their relationship with other characters). Essentially, what I want are books that read like a character study on the MC. 

To give an example of the kind of protagonists and therefore books I like, here are some of my favourite series:

- Red Rising
- Dresden Files
- Alex Verus
- Murderbot Diaries 
- Stories of the Raksura
- Mother of Learning 
- The Perfect Run
- Scholomance 

Characteristics I like in an MC (and/or):

- Tragic Backstory™
- Ruthless
- Wiseass
- Anger İssues
- Competent 
- Hard-worker 
- Lonely/Needs a Hug 
- Angsty 
- Survivor

İn short, recommend me series where I can get to know and gradually fall in love with the protagonist. (I got a collection to maintain)

Some other fav characters:

- Gintoki from Gintama 
- Rand al'Thor
- Ryan from The Perfect Run
- John from Unordinary
- Vash from Trigun (Stampede characterisation especially)
- Kaladin Stormblessed
- Kaz Brekker

What next? ,"I'm relatively newly back into fantasy reading. 

Started with the mistborn original trilogy and as much as I enjoyed it I stopped half way through The Hero of Ages. Not sure why, I think I read a review of The First Law series and started that. 

I've absolutely fallen in love with Joe Abercrombie's  circle of the world books. I've gone straight firm the first law trilogy to the next three ""stand alones"" and havnt stopped. 

The character work, the battle scenes, the humour, it's all perfect. 

So my question is do I just carry and and plough straight into the Age of Madness series or try the Stormlight archieve?

I've wanted to give Sanderson another go and think Stormlight will be preferable to mistborn for me personally but worried if it gets into it it's 5 long ass books before I'd go back and finish the Circle of the world stuff ..

As a side note I mainly engage with audio books as I have a commute to work and Steven Pacey is on a whole separate level, it's amazing.

"I’m Courtney Smyth, author of THE UNDETECTABLES and THE UNDEAD COMPLEX. AMA! ","[The Undetectables' research room...sort of ](https://preview.redd.it/n4c0fglhqjsd1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0e3f6af576eddb4d754a512cae3018a58d32346)

What’s the craic r/Fantasy! I’m Courtney, author of queer fantasy mysteries THE UNDETECTABLES and THE UNDEAD COMPLEX, both published by Titan Books. 

I’m a chronically ill, nonbinary (they/them) writer from Dublin, currently living on the west coast of Ireland (and I cannot overstate how devastatingly beautiful it is – I’m a five minute walk away from a 13th century castle! (a small one. But a castle nonetheless)) with my partner and our pet corn snake, Steve. 

[THE UNDETECTABLES](https://courtneysmythwrites.com/books-by-courtney-smyth) was my debut. It’s the book that made me realise I could meld my life-long fascination with witches and magic with my life-long fascination with forensic science and mysteries to create a magical PI agency fronted by three witches and a ghost in a cat costume, all who have their own magical forensic specialities. And then add a chronically ill MC to the mix. And then have her yearn for her best friend. And introduce a serial killer. (In short: be gay, solve crimes, take naps) 

[THE UNDEAD COMPLEX](https://courtneysmythwrites.com/books-by-courtney-smyth) is a sequel that takes place 5 months after the events of the Undetectables. It became my homage to fantasy/zombie tv shows like TWD, TLOU and Supernatural where I tried to answer the following questions: what if the show was badly made, what if there were murders, and what if the murders were absolutely BAFFLING in their execution? 



So if you’ve any burning questions about my books, my writing process, my characters, writing queer characters, writing disabled characters, the creation of magical insects/forensic science methods, mystery writing or anything else craft or story based, ask them below! 

I will also happily answer questions about; 

* My love of forensic science (especially the work of Frances Glessner Lee) 
* 2000s crime procedural shows 
* The correct way to brew Irish tea 
* Book recommendations (although I’ll be preaching to the choir here!)
* Idk I will answer anything I love talking and I love questions

Underwater Warfare and Civilization: What is it like in fiction?,"I find stories about underwater people really interesting.  But I find many of them lack the kinds of visceral detail I crave. For example, they often are deep in the sea... and yet it's bright as day, as if they were in a tropical shallow. And underwater warfare can get to be utterly cartoonish, where people fire regular guns underwater, or even throw grenades! In Xcom 2, you could throw grenades underwater, despite it having simulated armor thickness and all sorts.

So I wanted to ask you about the best depictions you've seen of underwater fighting and civilization, and feel free to share your own thoughts. For example, I was thinking bioluminescence would be a really cool aspect of warfare, and wondered if any story incorporated that.

Would love to see a story that uses buoyancy, as well. Best example I can think of was Scrooge McDuck when he was kidnapped by Atlanteans.",fantasy

Grimdark Fantasy Recommendations ,"I've fallen in love with Christopher Buelhman's horror-turned-fantasy style of writing. I've read every book he has published but now that I have none left I'm ravenous for more. 

I've tried a few patches and been left disappointed. To be clear I still finished all of the series listed as far as they've been published. This is all I've read in the past yearish. 

- Patrick Rothfuss - I don't understand the hype around his work. I had a friend beg me to read the kingkiller chronicle and I just... Kvothe is boring, and the writing makes my eyes roll. He does have a very intriguing world, the creatures, locations, culture concepts, and a fun magic system to boot. 1.5/5

- Scott Lynch - at first I really liked the gentleman bastards, but the characters grew too perfect. The initial heist-like writing was enticing and very well done but once the story focussed more on Jean and Locke feel like Lynch wanted to write a single character good at everything, but split them into two to scare off the ""Mary Sue"" claim. 2.5/5

- Peter McLean - I LOVED Priest of Bones. His series certainly weakens as it goes on, just enough action to keep it rolling, just enough power/intrigue/ hinting to keep it all good. Loved it. 4/5

- Joe Abercrombie - the G.O.A.T. for real. King Grimdark. I love Abercrombie's work about as much as I love Buelhman's. 5/5 read everything he's ever written and still want more.

- Brandon Sanderson - this is the one exception to my ""read it all"" rule. I just can't get into this guy's work. I've tried, I don't know what stops me but I literally just forget I'm reading his books.

So I beg the collective, please please give me something to read. I'm so desperate for another good story.

Looking for magic that is simultaneously esoteric and explicable,"It feels like magic in fantasy these days is either Branderson-style superpowers with extra steps or wishy-washy bullshit with no rules.

I want a protagonist whose steps into the occult only reinforce the feeling that they're standing in vast cavern with a single torch for illumination. I'm looking for magical research that feels like it belongs in a grimoire and not Nature.

To put it another way, I want proper wizard shit.

My preference is for female protagonists, but don't let that stop you from suggesting stories that would otherwise fit. I also think grimdark is cringe af and will probably avoid anything you describe as ""dark,"" but feel free to suggest things for the benefit of people googling this in 9 months.

Books that are similar to Infernal Devices or Throne of Glass Series,"I haven't read a lot of books, but I really like Shadowhunters novels and Throne of Glass series. Some of these are a bit cliche but overall I liked the concept and especially the characters such as Tessa, Jem, Magnus, Julian, William, etc. It is my most favourite series  because every character is unique and has a development arc. Also, the stories are so, intertwined and each event that happened in the history with each different person has an impact on the present events and characters.

Both series are enjoyable, has character developments and most importantly, a very intertwined and deeply sewed plot line. It's heavy with suspense, secrets and full of exploration elements with inclusion of Romance. I also liked Harry Potter and works of J R R Talkeins for the grand adventure style of story. 

I know we shouldn't judge the book from its cover but I have tried a couple of them such as A Discovery of Witches, Shadow and Bone, some from jay Kristoff and many others, but when I see their summery what are they about, I don't feel any particular appeal towards reading them as I did when I started Throne of Glass for example. A Discovery of Witches held my interest and I like the first one for the elements of science and history in the fantasy, but that was it. The characters and their development was very poor. 

So, any book recommendations that matches the style and genre of these two series?",fantasy

I know the Protector of the Small books are meant for middle schoolers, but I (adult male) am still loving especially the story being set in a school for training pages to be squires. The details on what goes into becoming a squire, and then a knight, as well as this focus on low-stakes dorm life is something I haven't read before in medieval low-fantasy. 

I'd appreciate any recommendation similar to this series that folks might have? ",fantasy

"Looking for a book about a Newly Turned FMC Learning Supernatural Life (Vampire/Pack Dynamics, Sire/Maker Bonds)","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for a fantasy book where the female main character (FMC) is newly turned into a supernatural species (vampire, werewolf, etc.) and has to adapt to her new life by joining a coterie/pack/coven, etc. Here are some specific traits and plot points I’m interested in:

FMC Characteristics:

1 - Quiet, observant, and not overly sassy or overpowered, especially as a newly turned supernatural.

2 - Doesn’t spend half the book hating the male main character (MMC).

3 - Has a mature relationship with the MMC without constant yelling or screaming.

Plot Elements:

1 - The FMC tries to learn and adapt to her new life as a supernatural being, whether it’s a vampire, werewolf, or another type of creature.

2 - Whether the turning was consensual or not, she realizes there’s no point in rebelling or being sassy. She understands she needs her sire/maker (or the pack leader) to teach her how to survive.

3 - If the turning was consensual, a familial bond or similar relationship develops between the FMC and the MMC.

Character Dynamics:

1 - Choices and actions have meaningful consequences. If the FMC does something naive or makes a mistake, she has to suffer the consequences. The author doesn’t make her immune from pain and suffering, and not everything always ends up perfectly for her.

2 - The FMC may dislike her sire/maker/alpha, but she doesn’t voice it out loud while she needs his help.

3 - The story should feature class differences between the FMC and the MMC, where the FMC is newly turned or joins the pack/coterie/coven and has to learn their ways. 

I’m open to apprentice x master or sire/maker x childe/fledgling dynamics, or even newly turned werewolf (or another supernatural creature) joining a pack with a strong hierarchical structure.

I'm looking for a story where the FMC’s choices matter, and she approaches her situation with a sense of pragmatism and maturity. Any recommendations that fit these criteria would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",fantasy

Spooky Season Recs,"Really want a good spooky season book to read.   I've seen a few recs lately I really want to read, but there's a months long wait for most of them at the library.   (Between Two Fires, Once and Future Witches, Foul Days, the Reformatory). 

(Ps - I'm not a Stephen King fan (he's definitely an amazing writer.  I just don't like the stories he tells or the rampant overuse of slurs and racism and misogyny).)



If you would like a rec, I'm currently reading Wrath of the Triple Goddess (the latest Percy Jackson) and it's super fun and perfect for this time of year.  Percy and crew are pet sitting for Hecate in her weird spooky mansion.  Would definitely recommend if you like Percy.

What fantasy stories stick in your head? ,"Hi all, I was just sitting alone in my house re-reading the Farseer books for the gazumpteenth time this past decade and I started to wonder, what exactly makes this story stick in my head? Which expanded my thinking to, **""what makes some stories stick to readers?**""

I think for me Fitz' story is about a remarkable outsider, who's set up from birth to not be unremarkable, and he even believes himself to be unremarkable at times, but he very much is in his own little ways. Seeing his little successes inspires me to take my small wins, and appreciate my own weaknesses and strengths. 

So, I brought this question here because I thought it'd be a good discussion piece--what makes fantasy stories stick in your head? Is it a specific character or multiple? Is it the magic system in the story? Is it how original that story is? Any reason at all, share with the class! Also, ANY fantasy story counts, not just books--comics, TV shows, movies, shitty Wattpad stories; whatever has been stuck in your head and keeps you coming back, it's eligible.",fantasy
Any tips for good pirates themed or sea journey themed books with or without fantasy elements?,"HI,

I kinda checked my book collection, and I have no pirate theme or any books being mostly about sailing adventurer (One Piece manga does not count) either with or without fantasy elements.

Pretty much at this point i would take anything, because I feel starved in this area :D

Any suggestion of fantasy with paladins?,"There's a quote from The Dresden Files that stuck to me. When Dresden introduced Michael Carpenter as pretty much a holy knight, she says something on the lines of ""I know these self-righteous tipes"" and he corrects her. ""He's not self-righteous. He is righteous. He's the real deal.

So, what I want is a story in wich someone like Michel Carpenter is the protagonist. The closest you get to the paladin stereotype, the better. Heavy armor, holy sword, divine smite, oaths, honest, good. The whole thing. It might be the ""real world"" or a secondary world. 

Anyone has anything?",fantasy
"Could fantasy where humans, orcs, fae/elves and trolls could be either virtuous or demonic be effective?","When it comes to fantasy, it seems that some of the community wants various races to be unanimously grouped into different factions, fighting for good and a better future or pure chaos and wickedness.  For elves, for example, there are those who like Lord of the Rings style and those who feel elves should be at best mischievous and evil at worst.  And with orcs and trolls, more or less the desire seems to be villainous across the board.

Could there be fantasy where different races have distinct splits into various subcultures, values and conditions that lead them to be virtuous and orderly or evil and chaotic?  For example, if elves and fae folk were split into those who had the virtues of LOTR elves being forced to coexist alongside mischievous elves/fae folk who are at  eternal war with humans and other races?  And for orcs, for some of them to be chaotic or downright demonic and others to be anti hero types with strong senses of honor and integrity?  Same for trolls?

Would this lead to fantasy being too unrelatable or could it potentially done in ways to make fantasy in compelling?   Maybe it's a self evident question but I was wondering.",fantasy

**Length**: 366 pages

# Q&amp;A

**Thank you for agreeing to this Q&amp;A. Before we start, tell us about yourself?**

Like many, I came to writing by way of TTRPGs. I was always the GM (control freak much?) and loved creating my own worlds and stories. It’s kinda funny. We never played pre-made campaigns/adventures because I didn’t have the attention span to read them through and hated the limitations, but I was entirely happy to spend weeks building worlds. This eventually led me to trying my hand at writing short stories back in the 90s. I never did anything with them, never tried to submit them to magazines. Writing seemed like an impossible dream, not to be taken seriously.

Something broke in me somewhere around 2007 and I decided I was going to write a novel. I’d tried before and found it too much work but this time I was going to damned well finish it. Oh, stubbornness might be my superpower. That novel was published in 2013 by a Canadian micropress called Five Rivers and was later self-published as *Ghosts of Tomorrow*. I took everything I learned during the writing and editing of that novel and threw it into my second book, *Beyond Redemption*, which was published by Harper Voyager in 2015.

Since then, I’ve published 14 novels, been an SPFBO finalist twice, and won an r/Fantasy STABBY award for best self-published novel. The STABBY dagger is crazy cool and lives on my desk alongside my toy cars, obsidian knife, and assorted guitar picks. Don’t ask.

These days I spend most of my time at the dining room table hunched over a shitty little laptop banging out my weird little stories.

 **What brought you to** r/fantasy\*\*? What do you appreciate about it?\*\* 

I created my reddit account on June 15^(th), 2015, the day before *Beyond Redemption* was released by Harper Voyager. My first post was a self-promotion (no, I hadn’t read the rules) for which I received a polite slap on the wrist.

These days I do more lurking than posting, but I do comment with book suggestions if I think I have something awesome to share, and to thank folks for dropping reviews of my books. Despite it being a huge community, the Mods somehow manage to keep it running pretty damned smooth. With GoodReads being such a festering shithole, r/fantasy is the single greatest resource for fantasy readers. Oops. Was that a little strongly worded? My bad.

 **Who are your favorite current writers and who are your greatest influencers?** 

I don’t read much these days. Every time I pick up a book that little demon on my left shoulder whispers, “You should be writing, you lazy fuck.” And then I go back to working on my next book.

Here are the last books which really blew me away: *Children of Time* (Adrian Tchaikovsky), *Legacy of the Brightwash* (Krystle Matar), *Master Assassins* (Robert V.S. Redick), *Miss Percy's Pocket Guide to the Care and Feeding of British Dragons* (Quenby Olson).

My single biggest influence would be Michael Moorcock. I read the Stormbringer books when I was thirteen and they stuck in my brain. Anti-heroes were immediately so much more interesting than heroes. Even when I try and write heroic fantasy, my characters turn out deeply flawed. It’s not something I think about or pan, I just can’t help it!

 **Can you lead us through your creative process? What works and doesn’t work for you? How long do you need to finish a book?**

First, I have far more book ideas than I will ever have time to write. What a lot of people don’t get is that the ideas are the *easy* part. The number of messages I get from folks offering me their ideas (as long as I split the profits 50/50 with them after I’ve written the book) is hilarious. I always tell them, “No, I don’t want to hear the idea. Write the book yourself.” Oddly, they never do.

I have a couple of basic rules when it comes to creativity. First, I never write my ideas down. I’m not one of those people with a notepad beside the bed. If I can’t remember an idea the next day, it wasn’t that good. In fact, that’s how I choose which idea to pursue. If a story is still bugging me months later, that’s the one that gets my attention. Is this a great and profitable way to decide what to write? Nope! But it keeps me happy and sane, and those things are nice, even if you can’t trade them for groceries.

The other basic rule is “always throw out your first idea.” The first idea is the easy one, the lazy one. The easy and lazy ideas have been done to death.

When it comes to the actual writing process, I’m a plantser. There’s probably a better word. I’m somewhere between a pantser (no planning, writes ‘by-the-seat-of-their-pants), and a planner (works out every detail, beat, plot point in advance). I typically have an idea how the book will end but am not wedded to it. If the ending changes, that’s fine. I like to plot three chapters and then write them. I read them over, see where the story wants to go next, and plot the next three chapters. Rinse and repeat until everyone is dead or the world has been destroyed. Oh, shit! I *am* a grimdark writer!

I can finish a garbagey first draft of 100,000 words in about three months. It takes another three months to polish, edit and rewrite stuff to the point where I think it might not be utter dreck. Eight editing passes later I send it to my test-readers and tell them it’s the first draft.

 **How would you describe the plot of** ***The Storm Beneath the World*** **if you had to do so in just one or two sentences?** 

*Children of Time* meets *Blood Song*.

 **What subgenres does it fit?** 

I have no idea! I don’t think about genre when writing, I’m simply trying to tell a story to the best of my ability. To me, it feels too small to be epic fantasy. While dark in places, the characters are doing their best to save their home; so, it’s not grimdark. The characters also lack the confidence of purpose so common in heroic fantasy (and, for the most part, they’re not terribly heroic anyway). Is there a fantasy genre that mostly takes place in magic schools? I’d prolly call it that.

 **How did you come up with the title and how does it tie in with the plot of the book?**

Like your typical fantasy novel, the book takes place in the upper atmosphere of a mega gas giant world. The characters live on the backs of colossal floating creatures that follow the air currents. When they look over the side of the island, they see the hellish depths of the lower atmosphere. It is literally a storm beneath their world.

In this case however there’s a bit of a double meaning. The things the characters learn at their magic schools forever change their understanding of both their civilization and the greater world around them. A storm of change, building from the lowest ranks of society, is going to sweep away the old world.

 **What inspired you to write this story? Was there one “lightbulb moment” when the concept for this book popped into your head or did it develop over time?** 

Like I mentioned earlier, this is the idea that stuck with me. It first popped into my head back in 2017. I was in the middle of writing some other book (I think it was *Ash and Bones*) and didn’t have time to pursue it. At some point in 2019 I started making world-building notes and fleshing out the magic system. I didn’t start writing until 2021 after Clayton and I finished *Norylska Groans*. I finished it in 2022 and then my agent spent a year and a half shopping it to publishers. Despite a lot of lovely feedback, they all passed. A common response was something along the lines of ‘we don’t know how to sell this.’ Writing a book that didn’t fit into a nice genre slot was a brilliant idea. Way to go Mike!

When it became obvious the book wasn’t going to land a publishing deal, I self-published it in 2024 to fairly astounding reviews.

 **If you had to describe** ***the story*** **in 3 adjectives, which would you choose?** 

Damaged. Lost. Striving.

 **Would you say that** ***The Storm Beneath the World*** **follows tropes or kicks them?** 

Damn. I dunno. I never think about tropes.

I can say that I don’t attempt to write to tropes, but that doesn’t mean people won’t find them. I can also say I wasn’t putting effort into busting tropes (though I did poke fun at a couple).

 **Who are the key players in this story? Could you introduce us to The Storm Beneath the World protagonists/antagonists?** 

I’d rather the readers discover them without foreknowledge. That’s the best way to go into any book. Frankly, I’ve already spilled too much.

 **Have you written The Storm Beneath the World with a particular audience in mind?**

I tend to write for adults, for people who can handle and understand mature themes. That said, with this one, I think I wrote something that the YA market could appreciate. It wasn’t quite intentional.

 **Alright, we need the details on the cover. Who's the artist/designer, and can you give us a little insight into the process for coming up with it?** 

What a clusterfuck this cover was. The first artist turned in AI generated images and then disappeared. I tossed those and hired Andrew Maleski, who also did the cover for *A War to End All* (Manifest Delusions #3). He turned in an incredible piece, exactly what I asked for and I love it. Six months later, however, I was getting a lot of feedback that folks were turned off by the cover. It was too strange. I’ve now slug together a more “typical” cover for the ebook though Andrew’s artwork remains on the paperback and hardcover.

My process is always the same. I send the artist a brief description of a scene from the book and then shut things like, “Make it gratuitously cool!” After that, I try and stay out of their way.

 **What was your proofreading/editing process?** 

I tend to leave myself a lot of notes/comments while I’m writing. It’ll be stuff like ‘make sure this jives with the previous chapter’ or ‘what colour is this guy’s hair?’ My first editing pass is going through the document and addressing all those comments. I also build a LIST OF CHANGES as I write so as to avoid killing my momentum. These range from major plot points to character backgrounds and world-building details. My second edit pass is addressing those and writing the needed changes. This involves a lot of chapter hopping because any change will have an impact on the rest of the story. After that, I’ll do several read-throughs fixing shitty sentences and looking for egregious errors. My final edit pass is having Word read the novel aloud to me as I read along. This is a great trick for catching those little typos that sneak past.

 **What are you most excited for readers to discover in this book?** 

I want the reader to be amazed when they discover they’re relating to these characters, and I hope they find something in each character they can relate to. Much as I love the world and the addiction-based magic system, the story is all about the characters.

 **When can we expect to read the second book of the duology?**

I dunno! Right now, I’m writing a real-world horror novel (with madman Clayton Snyder) and a murder/mystery that takes place in the Obsidian Path world. I’m also finally ready to write the final Obsidian Path novel, completing Khraen’s journey.

 **Can you, please, offer us a taste of your book, via one completely out-of-context sentence?**

“You need to question everything.”

"2024 Bingo - 5 Books Quick Reviews (The Last Binding, Aru Shah, The Spear Cuts Through Water, The Oracle Glass, The Dead Cat Tail Assassins)","Hey everyone, it's me again back with my next 5 books read for the bingo. It took me a longer time to get through this 5; I took a break and read some non-fantasy and other books that don't qualify for the bingo in the middle of this set.

Here is my rating system - though many books can fall in between tiers:

* **5** - Life-changing, transformative, lasting influence on how I see the world and literature
* **4** - A great read that both is highly enjoyable and has literary merit
* **3** - A decent read, with noticeable flaws or lack of depth but still has strengths and was worth finishing
* **2** - A bad read, but I still finished it
* **1** - A horrible read, DNF

**11) A Marvellous Light (The Last Binding #1) by Freya Marske (pub. 2021)** - finished July 30

* **Read for:** Romantasy (HM, M/M)
* **Also applies to**: Multi-POV (just manages to have 3, with the first POV only being used in the first chapter), First In A Series, maybe Dreams (HM, mentioned briefly), Prologues and Epilogues (only has an Epilogue)
* **3.75/5 stars.** I really need to give the romantasy subgenre more credit as the 2 romantasy books I have read this year have both really been better than I expected. This is a solid fantasy mystery with a very compelling romance at its core, whose main strength is in its incredible, evocative, musical prose. Where the book does fall short is that the two main leads are so much more fully realised than all the other characters that the discrepancy is a bit galling. Note: This book is R18 and explicit.

**12) Aru Shah and the End of Time (Pandava Quintet #1) by Roshani Chokshi (pub. 2018)** - finished August 5

* **Read for:** Author of Colour
* **Also applies to**: First In A Series (HM), maybe Dreams (HM, mentioned briefly), Reference Materials
* **3.5/5 stars.** This is a middle-grade fantasy adventure book published through the Rick Riordan Presents imprint, about a young girl named Aru Shah who is the reincarnation of the hero of Hindu myth, Arjuna. The prose style uses a very good balance of contemporary, everyday language, and more reflective, even artistic turns of phrase, and I found the use of Indian mythology really interesting, clever, and accessible. However, pacing is pretty uneven - the opening and rising action feel rougher and less complete than the rest of the story, and readers are not really given time to appreciate the way Aru’s life is changed by her mythological destiny. There is also not much depth yet to the characters, and Aru’s traits are talked about a lot more than actually shown. 

**13) The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez (pub. 2022)** - finished August 14

* **Read for:** Dreams (HM - contains both magical and mundane dreams)
* **Also applies to:** Author of Colour; Under the Surface; Multi-POV (HM, one of the most multi-POV works ever of all time), Character with a Disability (HM), Reference Materials
* **5/5 stars.** This book shattered my expectations at pretty much every turn! Boldly experimental and beautifully written, this is a thrilling fantasy adventure in the style of an epic of oral history, a heartwrenching exploration into what it means to have a heritage, and, of course, “a love story to its blade-dented bone.” Weaving together first, second, and third-person POVs, various periods of time, myth and reality, and the historical and the personal, this novel creates a truly unique reading experience that made me feel like I as a reader was genuinely part of the story. But even without those larger-than-life themes, the book is already great just on plot and characters alone. If you are part of a diaspora/a third culture kid, or are a child of a nation with fraught history, you may cry. I cried. First 5-star read of the year.

**14) The Oracle Glass by Judith Merkle Riley (pub. 1994)** - finished August 24

* **Read for:** Character with a Disability (HM - protagonist Genevieve is born with a “twisted leg and spine”)
* **Also applies to:** Dreams (HM), Multi-POV (most of the book is in Genevieve’s first-person narration, a few chapters are in other people’s third-person), Published in the 1990s, Reference Materials 
* **3.5/5.** Although at some points I considered it a 3.75. This is a historical fantasy novel set in the time of the Affair of the Poisons of 1600s France and is honestly really much more historical than fantasy. I enjoyed Genevieve as a character and appreciated the constant conflict between her cynical intellect and and her sentimentality. However, while I usually enjoy slower-paced novels, there was a point where I felt that events were becoming very repetitive. The latter part of the novel didn’t really seem to have a point to make. Fans of slice-of-life plots may enjoy this more than I did. 

**15) The Dead Cat Tail Assassins by P. Djèlí Clark (pub. 2024)** - finished October 1

* **Listened to the audiobook** read by Lynnette R. Freeman
* **Read for:** Criminals
* **Also applies to:** Entitled Animals, Published in 2024, Author of Colour
* **3.5/5.** This novella is a fun, highly kinetic and vivid romp that is essentially one step away from being a fantasy action movie. It has a fascinating cast, a fresh premise, and great pacing… but the ending fell really flat. The action film-like tone was definitely both a strength and a weakness - most of its plot beats aside from the truly interesting premise are cliche and predictable, but well-loved and executed skillfully (again, right up until the ending). Similarly, the novella employs a lot of irreverent, self-aware, quippy humour which does not always land and is honestly beginning to seem dated in 2024. All that aside though, Lynnette R. Freeman as the audiobook narrator was incredible with impressive variety and emotional range, and truly bringing the AAVE and creole languages used in the book to life.

That's all for now - thanks if you have read this far and please do comment what you think of these books if you have read them!",fantasy
ISO book rec with Greek Myth Cassandra vibes,As the title states… looking for a book with Greek myth/lore that has the Cassandra story at the core of the plot. It can either be a retelling or a romantasy/fantasy book with that borrowed lore. I searched the search bar but I might not be using great search terms! There also could just not be a book with this! Thank you 😊 ,fantasy
"What are the most impressive, powerful NAMES you've come across in fantasy media?","I've personally never played The Legend of Zelda, but I thought of this while I was watching Girlfriend Reviews (the Ocarina of Time episode), and thought of the Great Deku Tree (I don't know if that's how it's spelt).


Anyway, what are some of the coolest or grandest names you've come across in fantasy fiction? Could be a person, a place, anything, really.
I'll go first, as an example:-


1. The Paths of the Dead (The Lord of the Rings)
2. The Red Viper (Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire)
3. Morgoth Bauglir (The Silmarillion)
4. Death of the Endless (DC Comics)
5. The Abyss Watchers (Dark Souls)
6. Lord of the Creative and Lord of the Deranged (The Elder Scrolls; not an officially recognised name, but what Sheogorath calls himself in one of the myths about him)",fantasy
Cyclops: What are the most interesting cyclopes you've seen?,"Cyclopes don't seem to be particularly of interest, in most writings I can think of. They tend to be one off monsters, if that. They were very popular in mythology in the past, however.

I was wondering if anyone has seen a really cool take on cyclopes, and could share a little about them.",fantasy
Sooo are there any magical creatures or monsters in assassin's apprentice?,Almost done with book one. Does it just continue with quarrels among the people? ,fantasy
More thoughts on Kushiel’s Legacy after finishing both Phédre’s and Imriel’s trilogies,"Tl;dr: These books were both emotionally gripping and surprisingly thought-provoking and I loved them. I also kind of want to restart them immediately in audiobook form, partly because I’ve grown attached and partly because this was definitely a binge read and i think there are a lot of parts I’ll enjoy taking in a little more slowly now that the anxiety of needing to know what happens is out of the way.


Some more detailed thoughts (I tried to tag any significant spoilers included here):

-I already loved Phédre and Joscelin after book one, and they really just got better. Their trajectory in book 2 was genuinely agonizing to read, but I think all the angst and suffering made it even more rewarding to see them in the next four books, as a more mature couple who have learned how to support and trust each other—so that even when they’re going through really difficult stuff, there’s no longer any doubt that their relationship will survive it.

-I thought I loved Phédre and Joscelin as a pairing, but it turns out I love Phédre, Joscelin, and Imri as a family unit even more. 🥹  

-I never stopped hating Melisande for &gt;!how she abused Phédre, but I actually sort of liked the way her story played out. She was pretty awful regardless of how much she loved her own son, but I was left with the feeling that she didn’t need to be executed because missing out on his life was probably punishment enough. I wouldn't have been mad if Carey had found a way to make her go to the scary cave in Crete and face all the suffering she helped cause though, lol.!&lt;

-I love the way this series engages with religion and Kushiel made for a really interesting focal point. At first it seemed like the main (only?) significance of Kushiel’s dart was Phédre being a masochist who can make a killing as one of Naamah’s most special servants, but he (and the concepts he represent) just got richer and more interesting with every book.

-Imriel’s first book was pretty uncomfortable to read—not because the series got smuttier for his trilogy (although I’ll admit the &gt;!Shahrizai Family BDSM Party™️!&lt; threw me for a loop), but because Carey did such a good job of capturing all of his teen angst. The combination of normal hormone-fueled urges with the added layer of fear, shame, and disgust that comes from his PTSD was all so visceral—it had me genuinely sick to my stomach for him, especially &gt;!the sequence where it all comes to a head and he’s so overwhelmed by fear and self loathing that he leaves for Tiberium.!&lt; 

-In general I think Carey did a great job exploring trauma and its impact on the characters. It’s not very often that I feel like sexual violence actually adds much of anything to the experience of reading a fantasy novel, but in this case it made for some very moving and cathartic reading. (It actually brought up so many feelings that I was like, *FINE, I’ll stop putting off finding a new therapist*, lol)

-I did love Imri’s trilogy a lot, maybe even as much as I loved Phédre’s. After book 1 I was skeptical about &gt;!Imriel and Sidonie!&lt; as a romantic pairing but damned if she didn’t win me over with them. She’s such an interesting character in her own right and by the end of all their ordeals I wanted nothing more than for them to be happy and undisturbed forever. &gt;!Their scenes in Carthage and New Carthage were some of the best, imo—I’m such a sucker for the concept that even with their memories all addled by sorcery they still managed to find each other thanks to their real personalities shining through.!&lt;

-Berlik and Lucius&gt;!/Gallus!&lt; were highlights of the secondary cast for me, but there were so many good minor characters—Dorelei, Eammonn, Mavros, Alais, Barquiel L’Envers, Nicola, Maslin, etc. all added so much life to the story. Eammonn also gets points for being &gt;!the reason we get to see Grainne again!&lt;—and thereby bringing back my favorite of the Phédre’s boy chants: &gt;!Man or woman, we don’t care. Give us twins, we’ll take the pair!!&lt;

-Terre D’Ange isn’t a perfect place or anything, but it left me feeling so wistful about the idea of a place where purity culture doesn’t exist, sex is treated with reverence instead of stigmatized, and people are taught of sex as something that can and should be gratifying for both (or all?) participants, rather than the bizarre gendered view a lot of people in the real world grow up with. Things would be so different if that were the case.

Anyway, I'm vaguely sad to be done with them, except that I know they still exist and I can always go back to read them again. I do want to read the third trilogy eventually, but I think I'm going to take a break to read other things for a bit first. (I actually meant to do that between trilogies one and two, but that lasted all of 12 hours because I got too invested in Imri throughout Kushiel's Avatar.)",fantasy
Short Fiction Book Club: Dark Waters,"Welcome to today’s session of Season 3 of Short Fiction Book Club! Not sure what that means? No problem, [we’ve got an FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1embc20/short_fiction_book_club_were_back_for_season/) explaining who we are, what we do, and when we do it. Mostly that’s talk about short fiction, on r/Fantasy, on Wednesdays. All are welcome. 

# Today’s Session: Dark Waters

**[The Incident at Veniaminov](https://mermaidsmonthly.com/2021/05/26/the-incident-at-veniaminov/)** by Mathilda Zeller (10500 words)

&gt; The summer had finally reached our island. We shed layers of knitted wool and sinew-sewn fur and let the wind move across our bare arms and legs — a vulnerable feeling after being perpetually covered for most of the year. Fishermen were out at all hours of the day or night. With the darkness only covering two hours in twenty-four, there was little need to stop; our people moved with the strange rhythms of the far north. From the tundra at the top of the world to the jungles in the south, this is where we had gathered. If anyone were to visit long enough, they’d notice we were different. 

&gt; But no one ever stayed that long. Not unless they were one of us. 

**[A Lullaby of Anguish](https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/a-lullaby-of-anguish/)** by Marie Croke (6400 words)

&gt; We used to cage them in the tide pools, when they were still small enough to capture in our little hands. Pull them out and snap photos that we could pretend to sell to magazines just like Papa. Them, gasping for breath, unable to see, fins fluttering. We would photograph until they began to loosen, go limp. And then we would dunk them again, let them freshen up. Try again.

# Upcoming sessions

On **Wednesday, October 30**, we will be hosting our monthly discussion, complete with first-line samples and small expansions to the tab hoard. There’s no slate: this is just a chance to drop in and discuss the short fiction that’s been on your mind lately. 

But first, we have another October session to explore, hosted by u/Nineteen_Adze:

&gt; I love the whole spooky-season experience and often try to pack my fall with stories that put me in a weird or eerie mood, whether that’s about ghosts or just the unsettling feeling of a story that sticks with me long after I’ve finished the last paragraph. When I was brainstorming what to discuss in October, I cast a wide net and got the recommendation for “Cretins” by Thomas Ha. It stuck in my head, so I kept exploring similar themes, and I’m delighted to have landed on three different stories with different uses of second person point of view-- whether blending first and second person, addressed to a nameless and voiceless “you,” or deeply inhabiting the “you” experiencing the story. These stories are from three venues that I had barely encountered before (thanks to the wide-ranging SFBC crew!), and I look forward to discussing them with my fellow second person enjoyers. If you haven’t tried it before, just know that the second person is your friend and it will not harm you. 

On **Wednesday, October 16,** we’ll be reading the following stories for our **Unsettling Uses of the Second Person** session: 

**[Cretins](https://www.weirdhorrormagazine.com/cretins)** by Thomas Ha (4800 words)
&gt; At some point, I stopped being scared of falling asleep. I think you’re only scared if you worry about what happens before you wake. Every time I get up now, from some bench, or sprawling on the sidewalk, or leaning against some building facade, I know I should do the checks. Go through my pockets and see if anything’s been taken. Feel for any injuries on the extremities, one by one. Taste tongue and teeth for blood. Make sure there’s no skull pressure, nausea, or other signs of concussion. But I don’t much bother with those lists anymore. If bad things are going to happen, they’ll happen, whether I end up being afraid or not.

&gt; Maybe that’s something you can understand.

**[Jinx](https://pseudopod.org/2024/02/02/pseudopod-904-jinx/)** by Carlie St. George (6300 words)

&gt; Your first date with Jake is perfect. So. That’s fucking weird.
&gt; Not a complaint, obviously. Actually, it’s a relief: you’ve been on far too many first dates with guys who, at first blush, seemed like cute, funny, thoughtful dudes with passionate but not emotionally unstable opinions about Star Wars—only to discover that they can’t stop ranting about their crazy bitch ex (Marcus), or think cops don’t have enough power, actually (Mike), or believe that women can just . . . “hold” their menstrual blood? (Kevin, Kevin, WTF, Kevin?) There are good guys out there. You’ve even dated a few, but . . . Christ, so many of them are such volatile, whiny little babies.

&gt; The good news: you are rehabilitated.

Interesting thing I noticed in Sourcery by Terry Pratchett,"""Conina spread the carpet on the floor. It had a complex pattern of golden dragons on a blue background. They were extremely complicated dragons, with long beards, ears and wings, and they seemed to be frozen in motion, caught in transition from one state to another, suggesting that the loom which wove them had rather more dimensions than the usual three, but the worst thing about it was that if you looked at it long enough the pattern became blue dragons on a gold background, and a terrible feeling stole over you that if you kept on trying to see both types of dragon at once your brains would trickle out of your ears.""

I am rereading Discworld and noticed this when they find the magic carpet in Creosote's treasury. When did the original gold dress blue dress debate happen? I know 4 or 5 years back it was popular but was it a thing back in the late 80s when this book was written? It seems way too coincidental with the way Pratchett is always referencing SOMETHING. ",fantasy
The Claw of the conciliator was an even stranger experience than The Shadow Of The Torturer was.,"As usual the prose was beautiful, and as such the the world and the vibe that helps convey is exquisite but tho the events/scenarios here are not only more in numbers, excitement, variety.. but so are they in weirdness, confusion and trancing. Here I’ve truly seen clear signs of both why Severian is an unreliable narrator from reveals such as the one with &gt;!Jonas!&lt; but also why he’s morally flawed beyond the nurture of his guild but also his own dispositions: &gt;!Jolenta.!&lt;

A highlight in this book for me was the tale of the student and his son which was a wonderful short story in it’s own right independent of how it serves the larger book of the new sun story or how it borrows from whatever Greek tale it was based on (I don’t know which it was). The Dr Talos's Eschatology and Genesis play was also very entertaining drama and I hope there's a part 2 to it in future books cuz as is I feel it's incomplete due to &gt;!Baldander's own misdoing.!&lt;

All in all this book kept me at a weird mind state wherein I teetered on the edge of grasping some larger picture for myself but never fully being able to do so either due to severian’s unreliability, the nature of the writing itself with all the archaic words or just maybe the mysteries are just in the latter parts of their set up phase before the eventual big payoffs due for the latter two books in light of rereads or no. All in all i did find it enthralling all the way through cause even tho the story at hand might be confusing and largely unplaceable for me, it’s also for sure goddamn atmospheric with a vibe like no other so I can’t wait to start Sword of the lictor tomorrow. Overall a 4.5 stars for me.",fantasy
Possibly a slightly (?) unpopular opinion: To Green Angel Tower is wonderfully paced,"I just finished the massive and massively satisfying third book in the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series by Tad Williams. I was amazed at the stamina of the author to maintain such great pacing--at least for my personal taste--for over 1000 pages. And not necessarily *fast* or *snappy* pacing. But I also didn't find it as too-slow as it seems many others do, even during the travel scenes. Rather, I felt from the first page that I was sitting with a thoughtful, funny, observant person who had an engrossing but patient way of telling a story, and weaving in details others might find insignificant but ultimately point wisely to a web of ethics and causality.

If you have read it, do you agree or disagree?",fantasy
Flip the script: Best movie to book adaption ever? ,"So we often talk about the book to movie / tv adaption, but what about the other way round? Which novelization of a movie is in your opinion the best? 

For me, hands down, it's Matthew Stover's Revenge of the Sith. The internal monologue and exploration of the characters' motivation actually made the story work. 

It didn't fix the double dipping problem (Anakin kills the desert raiders and  then that is just ignored, which was certainly a choice), but it does fix the actual movie of Revenge of the Sith. 

Interesting factoid: Peter Pan started life as a play so was technically novelized :D ",fantasy
Rerelease of Triumph of the Dwarves: Book 5 audiobook?,I was looking to buy book 5 of the Dwarves series on audible but I see there are 2? I'm guessing they re-did book 5 when the publisher switched from hachette audio to Arcadia. Anyone know which is better?,fantasy
African Game of Thrones?,"Any epic fantasy set in Africa-inspired world that is like A Song of Ice and Fire? What I mean by that is layered characters, morally gray multiple pov, violence and politics. Marlon James' Black Leopard Red Wolf was marketed as African Game of Thrones, but was disappointed to find out it was not...African Game of Thrones (Still enjoyed the story, the marketing was inaccurate) I love non-European settings, and Africa has a rich history and culture (i.e Mali Empire) but I feel it is somehow underutilized. Translated works or works by foreign writers are welcome ",fantasy
Let's list all the series that were abandoned after a great start,"This isn't about the series that ran out of gas or were killed before they ran out of gas, but the ones that had one or two novels that were brilliant and then simply disappeared, sometimes with the author.

Please feel free to add on or add your thoughts:

The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss- the great white whale of a genius series that has mostly frittered out in side projects.  The novel in the main story line was 2011. Probably will be done when Beyond Skyrim is complete.

Territory by Emma Bull - 2007 Oh this was good, a wild west fantasy that had lots of room to roam.  I've heard rumors of illness and maybe that's why it was never followed up.

Ratcatchers by Matthew Colville - Last installment 2014.  This had so much promise.

Shambling Guides by Mur Lafferty - Shambling Guide to New York City (2013) had a fun premise. Ghost Train to New Orleans (2014) was not in the same league but there was room to grow and recover.

Nevada James series by Matthew Storm - Not fantasy, but heading toward magical realism at times. There is alas no mystery here.  Matthew Storm (last name a pseudonym) apparently died in 2019 according to a post by his mom on his FB wall.  

And then two that are likely coming back after a long hiatus.  Bjorn Larsen's Children was an uber dark Norse fable.  The follow on cooked for a long time and finally hope will be rewarded November 5, when Land arrives.  

And then there are the King Henry tapes and it looks like Richard Raley is heading towards another major installment probably in 2025 (guess).  

Well that's my list, what's your's?",fantasy
"The Stormlight Archives, Kaladin","Hey, just wanted to rant about something.  
I'm  currently  making  my way through the 3rd book (almost done-part 4) and my opinion  has been that Kaladin is the main character of the series or the principal one. But why is he always  on some side quest!! He is never pushing  the narrative  forward.  Shallan has done more to progress the story than him. Shallan is uncovering secrets,   killing  unmade, developing  enough  personalities  to fill a mental hospital and more and Kaladin is on some erran for Dalinar. I love the character  and at the start  of the book he was the only reason I continued  with the series. Now I can't  figure  out the point of the guy,  if it's  not to fly somewhereand most of the time he can't  even do that because ""Reasons"". I love the character but  he starting to feel like a character  with a lot of opinions but who is content letting  other make choices  for him. He never see him give honest push back on anything.

Wandering Inn Ryoka,"I started the Wandering Inn about a week ago and I have really loved this cozy fantasy’s series! Erin has been a great character and I felt invested in her story almost immediately. Even chapters where she is doing basically nothing I found engaging. And the side characters are great too. (I love the guards she befriends a lot, and the stuff with the goblins)

HOWEVER… I’ve just begun getting Ryoka POVs and they are just abysmal… They are boring AND she is completely insufferable. It’s kind of throwing me from wanting to read the series, which is a shame.

More books with Death?,"It’s the time of the year where I start reading through my collection of books that involve a very specific portrayal of death; it’s something of a griefversary month so it’s always on my mind a bit more.

The specific genre I like is books with a character who is connected to death in a very gentle or bittersweet way — bonus points for characters like Charon/pyschopomps, or Terry Pratchett’s Death. Books that remind you of that one tweet that goes:

&gt;”i hope death is like being carried to your bedroom when you were a child &amp; fell asleep on the couch during a family party. i hope you can hear the laughter from the next room”


Here’s my collection so far:

- Mort by Terry Pratchett

- Under the Whispering Door by TJ Klune

- The Book Thief by Markus Zusak

- Sabriel by Garth Nix

- Record of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers


The problem is I’ve gotten through almost the entire list already, and it’s only the beginning of October. I’d love to add to it! ",fantasy

Can you recommend a fast catching Fantasy series? I only ever read A Song of Ice and Fire in the past 10 years.,"Hello /r/Fantasy,

I just reread the Song of Ice and Fire series again exactly 10 years after I finished the series my first time in 2014.
Now I'm kinda looking for another great Fantasy epos to get into.

I also read the first LOTR book in 2011 which I did not enjoy all too much if that helps (I love the movies though).

So I'm more looking for something comparable to A Song of Ice and Fire.
I do like emotional drama cause I'm usually getting very fast bonded with the characters involved.

Lots of series recommended here are very long reads like The Realm of the Elderlings or The Wheel of Time.
I'd prefer a series a little smaller than that. 
Usually I read Fantasy &amp; Drama Mangas cause it's faster reas than a whole book series.

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Favorite War in Fantasy?,"I've been thinking about wars in Fantasy and wonder which conflict has you the most gripped and enthralled through it.

My pick is the War of the Five Kings from Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Multiple great houses facing extinction, several battles, emphasis on both military and political importance, a stunning ending, and ramifications felt throughout the continent.",fantasy
New Reader Looking for a Dark Fantasy Universe,"I'm pretty new to reading novels and I want to read a good fantasy book with a large universe I can lose myself in.

I'm a slow reader and often have to stop and re-read something a couple of times to grasp it.

I love fantasy. I play a ton of fantasy video games and regularly play tabletop RPGs like D&amp;D. I've read LotR and The Hobbit a couple of times. I've also read the Mistborn trilogy and absolutely loved it. I've tried his Stormlight Archive a couple of times but couldn't get into it.



I'm more of a sci fi guy and I have been big into the Warhammer 40k lore and game since the '90s and read all the Horus Heresy books. I'm also in the middle of the third Dune book which I'm loving so far.



I got recommended Gardens of the Moon because the Malazan universe might interest me but everything says it's big and very complicated.



What I'm mainly looking for is an epic story set in a large universe I can get lost in. I like grim-dark stuff, hence the Warhammer, but it doesn't have to be very edgy for me to enjoy.

  
Does anyone have a good recommendation for me?",fantasy
"[Review] Jam Reads: Blood Price, by Nicole Evans","https://preview.redd.it/he764h2a87sd1.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2076622c4c4095ee131ab8a0f0c89dbddbb12d

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/blood-price-prices-asked-and-paid-1-by-nicole-evans)

*Blood Price* is the first book in the dark fantasy duology *Prices Asked and Paid*, written by Nicole Evans. A powerful and feminist story inspired by Norse mythology in a world where the power is centered on the bleeding cycles, with a compelling set of characters, and a quest that will defy the own gods.

Our main character is Ashilde, a warrior that would do anything to protect her tribe and her partner; her fierceness leads her to be the leader of the tribe. When a group of unmarked kills the few remaining hunters of the tribe, she will try to get help from other tribes, even if that's showing weakness, as they would perish without sacrificing the monthly tribute to gods; but when she loses her bleeding, she cannot longer kill. Cast out by the gods, she will be sent on a singular task to travel to gods' realm, and atoning for the failures of herself and the tribe. If she dies, another will be sent, until they are worthy of the gods again or the tribe is wiped out.  
A travel that she will start alone, knowing that she won't be able to pay in blood in the case of a fight, and which puts on her shoulders alone the destiny of her tribe; all over a person who was already doubting of herself, and that will need to find that fire needed to reach her destination.

I cannot stress enough how well-built Ashilde it: not only the fierce warrior that takes the responsibility of guiding and protecting the tribe, even when she is not sure if the decisions taken are correct, but also the powerful woman that after being cast out by the gods, out of sheer rage will reach their realm. But not only we have those highs, but Evans also makes us share her tribulations and her weakness, those moments where Ash is near to give up, when she's at the border of the collapse. Luckily, in the middle of the journey, she will find some help in the form of two animals which represent the two gods and a small children, whom she will establish a heart-warming relationship, that however, gets muddled due to Ash's previous acts. This supporting cast will play an important role on Ashilde's journey, as she wouldn't reach as far as she did without them, being that cane that helps you walk one more step.

The story is greatly paced, being a bit slower at the start, so Evans can introduce us to the world of Armadin and its mythology; clearly Norse inspired, but queernormative. The only ones allowed are those women that still menstruate, making the tribes to be organized around it, and enclosing in the process an important feminist message about how important feminine health it is and how bleeding is just something natural, a thing to normalize (in this aspect, it remembered me to *This Too Shall Burn*, by Cat Rector).

*Blood Price* is a powerful debut, an excellent novel for those that look for a character driven fantasy with excellently painted characters, characters that also struggle to fulfill what they are expected to (and I would totally say Ash might have impostor syndrome); I'm quite curious to see the second part of the duology because I'm so intrigued by the ending. Can't wait to return to Armadin!",fantasy
Review: Dungeon Exploiters: a gamelit adventure by Dustin Tigner,"Dungeon Exploiters is clever twist on the gamelit staple of being uploaded into a digital game world, with a cast of memorable young characters, challenging dungeons, set in an interesting videogame world that has become the last refuge of its inhabitants. I received a free copy of this ebook in return for an honest review.

Once, Entin was a normal boy on a colony spaceship, headed for a new world. Now, however, he lives a thankless life as a market Runner—a courier-like class of kids who deliver goods throughout the digital city. The world around him used to be the setting for an immersive VR game the colonists played, but after a cataclysm no one wants to talk about anymore, the inhabitants were uploaded into the game. This is their life now. And some of the colonists, like Entin’s parents, didn’t make it into their new reality, so Entin is officially an orphan and has little more than the default clothing on his back and the speed and maneuverability of his Runner class. While the future seems to stretch before him in an endless succession of delivery runs for skinflint merchants, Entin isn’t the type to give up. When a chance encounter with an adventuring group gives him the opportunity to enter a dungeon for the first time, Entin doesn’t look back.

So what if “Runner” isn’t a combat class? So what if he’s too poor to buy weapons or gear? He’s not here to beat the dungeon, but to exploit it, with determination and cleverness the likes of which the game has never seen.

The story is told from multiple POVs, two boys and two girls. In Tigner’s hands, the POV switches between chapters are easy to follow as each character has a distinct, immersive voice, believable motivations, and unique things to reveal about the world and each other. The writing style is clear and smooth, with description that makes the world and action come to life. Tigner measures out his worldbuilding and the colony’s backstory at just the right pace to keep tension high, avoid infodumps, and allow the reader to unravel the mystery of what problems lurk behind the digital paradise the original creators intended.

This books is great for anyone who enjoys gamelit/litrpg, clever characters doing the most they can with the cards they've been dealt, protagonist teams made of a diverse group of friends, imaginative worldbuilding, or just a clean, fun adventure story that is suitable for a range of ages.",fantasy
Recommend Books About Writing Fantasy,"Between novels, I've been enjoying reading books by authors about the craft and technical wizardry of creating speculative fiction. I'd appreciate recommendations for: books of essays, tales of the writer's life, the nuts n' bolts &amp; how-to's, and laments of the pitfalls and triumphs of the wonder and beauty of prose.

I'm *mostly* interested in authors of fantasy/speculative fiction, but am open to the works of wordsmiths of any genre.

Books I've read on the topic (or use as reference):

*Stephen King, On Writing

*Kurt Vonnegut, Pity the Writer

*Steven Pinker, Sense of Style

*Ray Bradbury, Zen in the Art of Writing

*Ursula K. LeGuin, The Language of the Night, Steering the Craft

*William Zinsser, On Writing Well

*Francine Prose, Reading Like a Writer

Reading Through Mists: A Lud-in-the-Mist Read-Along - Chapter 27,"## [Series Index - If you’re new to this read-along, start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BiggerBetterFaster/comments/gn4lk4/reading\_through\_mists\_a\_reading\_guide\_to/?)


#Chapter 27: Of Fantasy and Dreams
&amp;nbsp;  
In Chapter 27, Mirrlees flexes her muscles as a fantasist and shows just why this novel had such a profound impact on the genre. The fair is bizarre and full of dream-logic, but it’s also seeped in symbolism.

&amp;nbsp;
The chapter opens with Nathaniel reaching a unit of the Yeomanry stationed at the border. They’re unhelpful to him, but they do give us a kind reminder: Unlike his children, Nathaniel is crossing the border on his own accord. He’s not compelled by any fairy spell. And, more importantly, he has not eaten Fairy Fruit. 

&amp;nbsp;
A quick ride up the hill and we get to the heart of this chapter:

###The Fair
&amp;nbsp;
Nathaniel rides among the dead to a fair in the middle of a heath. He is in a state of some confusion, but whenever he asks himself a question, he immediately knows the answer, the way you do sometimes in dreams. Mirrlees chooses to give this subconscious knowledge a voice and a title - the Cicerone of Dreams. 

&amp;nbsp;
A Cicerone, for those wondering, is a museum guide, imparting knowledge to visitors about the objects they see as they go through the exhibits. And Nathaniel is in a way visiting a type of museum. Or, more accurately he engages with the surroundings in a similar fashion that one might do in a museum—never touching, only observing impersonally. 

###The Merry-go-round
&amp;nbsp;
At the heart of the fair, Nathaniel finds a tarnished, pony-driven merry-go-round. The songs mentioned here are, as far as I can tell, completely made up by Mirrlees. Presumably, there were some similar old songs that were lost to time that served as inspiration. They’re not really children’s songs, but songs that a child might know just because it’s popular.

&amp;nbsp;
The child on the merry-go-round is undoubtedly Ranulph. But Nathaniel doesn’t recognize him. It’s an interesting contradiction as Nathaniel recognizes everything that is strange to him, and fails to recognize his own son. However, the encounter does change Nathaniel. From that moment on, he is no longer a visitor to a museum. The noise of the fair begins to sound in his ears, and he can interact with the world. As such, he has no more need of the Cicerone. 

&amp;nbsp;
Nathaniel speaks to a seller of fairy fruit, but in the middle he gets a sense that he’s the protagonist of a story, and should not eat the strange fruit: 

&gt;""I am telling myself one of Hempie's old stories, about a youngest son who has been warned against eating anything offered to him by strangers, so, of course, I shall not touch it.""

&amp;nbsp;
Not eating the fruit of a strange place ties with the myth of Hades and Persephone, and is a recurring theme in fairy tales. However, the inclusion of it here is not meta-commentary. In the context of the story, it’s both true and false. Nathaniel in a way *is* making up the fair around him, and the rules that govern it. By deciding he’s the hero of the story, he effectively makes himself so. But he is also led away from the object of his desire. He turns his back on Ranulph and succumbs to the illusion of the place.

&amp;nbsp;
Is it fairy trickery? Is it a failing of Nathaniel? Is it all a dream? It’s up to the reader to decide, and the answer may well be any and all of the above.

###The Auction
&amp;nbsp;
After speaking with the fairy-fruit seller, Nathaniel gathers with the crowd around a stage, where Willie Wisp is busy running an auction to sell the Crabapple Blossoms to the highest bidder. Nathaniel doesn’t take kindly to that idea:

&gt;""But you have no right to do this!"" he cried out in a loud angry voice, ""no right whatever. This is not Fairyland—it is only the Elfin Marches. They cannot be sold until they have crossed over into Fairyland—I say they cannot be sold.""

&amp;nbsp;
Nathaniel, in his capabilities as a fairy trickster, knows instinctively the right thing to say. But his form of objection is an odd one: he is speaking of laws and rules. But aren’t those things meaningless here?

&amp;nbsp;
Here we see the first synthesis of Fairy and Law: The logic is the logic of dreams, but it is not lawless. Nathaniel’s “learned dissertation on the law of property, as observed in the Elfin Marches” has an immediate impact, and the girls are saved. 

&amp;nbsp;
As for his identity, it appears he is a celebrity at the fair. ""It is Chanticleer—Chanticleer the dreamer, who has never tasted fruit,"" they whisper. The significance of not eating fairy fruit is left, at this point, to the reader. But the main point is - Nathaniel has an identity here. A name and a title, and they both carry weight. When the crowd cries “Chanticleer and the Law!”, they could just as easily say “The Dreamer and the Law”. So here, through Chanticleer, dreams have laws. 


###The Town
&amp;nbsp;
As we read on, the fair vanishes, and Nathaniel travels through a strange town. He meets Portunus again, in a fashion, and witnesses the people living. But he also remembers Ranulph, and so he presses on. 

&amp;nbsp;
Where to? Well, we’re almost there.

"I finally read Gardens of the Moon (third attempt), where's my medal? (spoiler-free)","My story with Gardens of the Moon was tough. I've tried it first time around 7 years ago and DNF after 10-15%, cause i just wasn't interested much. I tried it again 2-3 years ago and got the same result. But now, after watching a lot of videos explaining what Malazan actually is i gave it another try and finally finished it, hooray!

So now, of course, i need to share my very important opinion with the whole internet, how else? And i even dare to say that it's unbiased, cause (spoiler) i definitely liked Gardens of the Moon, i will read the series further and i understand why so much people fond of it, but at the same time i can't say it's my favorite series, definitely not.

At first, i really liked the writing style of Erikson - it is descriptive enough to imagine things he wants to show, but at the same it's not overdescriptive, so you don't need to push yourself through the tones of unnecessary text, which is extremely cool. I was able to feel the emotions of characters and also just when i was starting to become bored of some storyline, it was changed to another one, so it was relatively engaging to go through the story.

Also, as a big fan of worldbuilding in fantasy i really appreciate the world of Malazan, it's complexity and rules - it's really feels like there's a lot and it's only the first book.

Story is also very complex and shown from multiple perspectives, which is also extremely satisfying and i was really waiting for it's climax which wasn't disappointing (well, almost).

Characters were also different and mostly interesting, hard to tell more without spoilers.

But there also  were some negatives.

It's really hard to get into this story. You really should watch some spoiler-free videos to know what to expect, because at first time you don't understand anything. At some point in the story you start to understand what's going on, what different characters/parties want to achieve and you have some solid grasp on the worldbuilding, but you wouldn't understand everything even after you're finish the book. Some dialogues, refers and mentions mean almost nothing to you, you understand that there is something bigger behind that, but don't know what. And the problem is, i can assume that by the time i'll reach the place in story where it will be explained (supposedly) i can just forget about this stuff. 

I know, definitely here will be some hardcore Malazan fans who can say ""No, you don't understand, it is supposed to be this way"" and i'll tell no, it shouldn't. ASOIANF is also very big and complex story, but it is built in the way the world and characters presented to you gradually, so you're not getting lost on your way and i think it's part of writer's skill to provide readers comfortable way to get into the story. So, it is like it is, but i can't say it's a good feature of this book.

Sometimes decisions and actions from certain characters feel rush and random, which makes some contrast with storytelling. I mean we're getting slow character developing, his thoughts, emotions something like that and then we're getting an action/decision which comes out of nowhere (&gt;!like Paran randomly decided to sleep with Tattersail!&lt;). Due to this reason the book final was a bit messy in my opinion, cause despite i thought i've catched the book's rhythm it was really hard to follow.

Also i wanted to see some more about many characters, because we mostly know about their present, but hardly know anything about their past and how they end up here.

In conclusion, i really liked the book, despite can't say i'm a huge fan and i will read it further (many people saying that they become real fans at the third book, so idk maybe i'll be one of them). But it has it flaws i guess and when people telling that Malazan is so unique and 'such on it's own thing' i dare to disagree with that, because yeah, each well-known fantasy is a bit unique in it's own way, but Malazan is definitely high-epic fantasy with some elements of dark fantasy - yes, complex, yes, deep-developed, but i can't say it's something very unique, fresh and new (book is pretty old already, i mean something fresh at the time it was released). And if you've read The Black Company by Glen Cook, you may notice something familiar. They have pretty much in common and even something in the writing seems familiar (which is not surprising, cause Erikson told himself that Black Company was a huge inspiration to write Malazan).

So, that was my way to get into this series. I wonder how you guys, who've read the series, got into it? What was your story?

P.S. I know many Malazan fans like to recommend the series left and right don't even bothering much to read the request properly, so please don't do it. I guess despite it is very cool series, imo opinion for new fantasy readers it's a very bad choice actually.",fantasy

Why?",fantasy
Trysmoon Saga Review (SPOILERS),"So, I recently finished the Trysmoon saga, and while I went into it after reading so many good reviews, I have been sorely disappointed by it. This review doesn't seek to take a dump on the series by a long shot, but it does seek to address the issues that most stellar reviews have overlooked, sadly to my detriment and most likely to that of many others. Be advised, there are copious amounts of spoilers ahead, though I will not be giving a detailed summary of the books. 

&gt;!The Trysmoon Saga, by Brian K. Fuller, follows the story of Gen, a young orphaned bard from a nowhere village who finds himself thrust straight into the midst of a prophecy that must be fulfilled for the reunification of the world, the rebirth of God, and the banishment of the evil god Mikkik. It is a classic zero to hero tale, and one thing that I must admit, is that Fuller is masterful in his prose, character creation and worldbuilding. !&lt;

&gt;!However, things quickly turn south, and while violence, sorrow and loss are not unexpected in dark fantasy stories, in Trysmoon, they all come from nowhere and tend to have little to no buildup. One moment you're seeing an idyllic village life, with typical small village troubles, and the next you're thrust straight into a bloody massacre that sees the protagonist's life upended and everyone he's ever known thrown into mortal peril. !&lt;

&gt;!This is still the best part of the series, in my opinion. Tension is constant, the characters have to be fast and clever to remain alive, and the enemy seems insurmountable, yet character development is constant, and Gen grows as both a man and a burgeoning warrior very quickly at the merciless hand of his captor. !&lt;

&gt;!Storytelling issues start to happen right away, however. Gen's relationships stop mattering other than as tools to hurt him, and the loss of his mentor and his first flame are as abrupt as they are absurd, particularly considering that what causes the latter's demise is, quite simply, a fully trained Gen losing a sword fight. This is where I started losing my suspension of disbelief, because Gen's defeat comes at the hands of an opponent that is vastly inferior in quality to many of the enemies Gen will encounter later on in the series, all of which he bests without significantly increasing the skills he already had acquired. !&lt;

&gt;!After his escape, the series begins a chain of issues that soon make the story unbearable to read. It is a sad reality that many dark fantasy authors believe that dark fantasy should revel in its own misery, and this is the illness that plagues the Trysmoon saga. Time and time again, Gen makes meaningful connections to people, including several romantic ones, all of which are only developed to the bare minimum that is necessary for the reader to care when they are then inevitably used to torment Gen. !&lt;

&gt;!The prophecy is a constant Sword of Damocles hanging over every morally righteous character in the story, starting when Chertanne arrives and dashes everyone's hopes for a noble and worthy up and coming King of the world, instead appearing as a lecherous, drunken, fat and immoral coward, which everyone is all too happy to enable despite their obvious hatred and disgust of him. From the very moment that Chertanne is presented, the abominable fate of the Chalaine, a girl who is otherwise lovable, soft and innocent, is sealed, and her agony at the hands and words of Chertanne is nothing short of pure literary torture. !&lt;

&gt;!The entire second book leads up to a marriage and consummation that the story takes great pains to constantly remind you of, always dashing every tiny morsel of hope, and dashing all possible avenues by which it can be avoided. When the horrible moment that Chertanne and the Chalaine are made to conceive the babe of prophecy arrives, the author has ensured you've seen her grow close and in love with Gen, and developed her character to the point that you can feel the same suffering both the Chalaine and Gen endure during that night. To me, this was nothing more than a gleeful and gratuitous act of cruelty that served nothing to advance the story, and was merely a way to dilate the length of the series, while giving nothing of true value that couldn't have been included in the other two books. !&lt;

&gt;!The third and fourth novels in the saga are essentially a drawn out series of people's relationships being used to hurt and torture them, the protagonists being subjected to all manner of abuse and degradation, and the evil antagonists having essentially free reign of the entire conflict. The protagonists are, by now, entirely devoid of cunning or deviousness, and it is only brute force and the sheer incompetence of the antagonists that lets them escape or be rescued from bondage after falling into trap after trap, or being forced into imprisonment by self-sacrifice in the face of impossible odds. I lost count of how many times all the characters seemed to finally be free, only for one of them to again be captured and subjected to various torments or impossible choices. !&lt;

&gt;!In these books, Fuller also abuses magical healing and resurrection at length, and any evil characters that are removed from play are only supplanted by other evil characters which in at least one case, only have the purpose of aiding the previous evil character's return. Protagonists and antagonists both are maimed, wounded, tortured, dismembered and even killed, only to be brought back or healed in some ways, while through it all, the rules are arbitrarily changed just so the story can gleefully dangle that elusive carrot that is hope in front of your eyes, only to snatch it away with a giggle just to watch you squirm. The (true) deaths of any character that is permanently killed are, just like before, abrupt and come out of nowhere, even when they're expected, and not even the ultimate villain is spared this fate. The final confrontation is as frustrating as it is confusing, and it answers precious few questions. !&lt;

&gt;!The ending, as praised as it is for being great and feel-good, is simply unsatisfying, and I admit to a great deal of amazement at how people praised it for being wholesome; I suppose the author was at least decent enough not to further torment the few survivors after everything was over, if that counts as wholesome at all.  !&lt;

&gt;!In conclusion, the Trysmoon Saga has been extensively reviewed as an excellent piece of dark fantasy literature... but I simply cannot describe it as such. If I had to choose a single word to define it, it would be ""disappointing"". !&lt;

"‘Ship of Destiny’ by Robin Hobb completes a memorable trilogy, even if some ends come to a less than satisfying conclusion ","While reading Ship of Destiny, I often got the feeling that the void created by the unfinished ASOIAF was somehow getting filled by reading this trilogy. To be sure, this is an entirely different story and world, but there are some striking parallels, such as multiple POVs, daughters fending for themselves in a dangerous world after separation from their doting fathers, all-powerful dragons, a convergence of multiple storylines happening in winter.. (ok, the last one was just me hoping that would happen in the soon to be released Winds of Winter.)

As the end to the Liveship Traders trilogy, this was a fascinating read for the most part, with all the dangling threads from The Mad Ship slowly coming to a conclusion, and some of the character interactions that we have been waiting for finally taking place, albeit in ways that are unexpected. The storyline around serpents, which was quite distracting in the first two books, also finally makes sense and becomes an integral part of the story’s world.

The book really soars when the story enters the final act. There is a convergence of multiple characters, in a liveship very fittingly, and there is tension built both from the anxiety of how the characters are going to treat and talk to one another, and also from the backdrop of constant danger in the setting itself. There were some hundred-odd pages in this stretch that I just couldn’t stop turning, in eager anticipation of what was to come next.

And that, finally, brings me to what I didn’t really enjoy about this book, and by extension the trilogy. Robin Hobb has done a fair job concluding the character arcs of the main characters, especially considering there are so many, but some of the character arcs make no sense at all. There is suddenly a new captain of pirate ships, who is accepted by all other pirates for no apparent reason. A young girl becomes someone else completely, and her transformation wasn’t believable at all to me. An iconic, complex villain, who has been shown as something of a legend throughout the series, turns into a standard villain, and his arc ends, well, too ordinarily. 

But overall, the ending is somewhat bittersweet, with most characters getting their happy endings and some getting acceptance and  the promise of redemption. In spite of my misgivings about the final few pages, this trilogy is among the best I have read. The characters feel real, the world feels real, and the writing is solid. Even with its flaws, it is a kind of book that draws you in like few others can.",fantasy

Book Review: Hell of a Witch (Tear Down Heaven #2) by Rachel Aaron,"**TL;DR Review:** Action, romance, magic, and intrigue dialed up to max intensity. A delicious “will they, won’t they” I absolutely loved.

https://preview.redd.it/91btjkrsv5sd1.jpg?width=938&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c65e83dc81a6363d1a3573d9d589224cb1e37a5

**Full Review:**

Oh, what a joy to be back in this witchy, demon-infested world where Heaven has been turned to a place of evil and the only one fighting for “good” is a disgraced (and downsized) demon queen!

In *Hell for Hire,* we got to meet Adrian Blackwood, witch extraordinare, and learned the truth about Bex, the Queen of Wrath. We learned about their vendetta against Gilgamesh, King of Heaven, and saw them beginning to stir up trouble in the magical world.  

Trouble is the name of the game in *Hell of a Witch.* We’re instantly thrust back into the action as Bex and her team—Iggy the hulking-but-good-natured wrath demon, Lys the cunning and sultry lust demon, and Nemini the…well…she’s just Nemini—take out warlocks and free demons from their heavenly shackles. Once the blood has flowed and the deed is done, it’s back to Adrian’s forest for some much-needed R&amp;R.

By R&amp;R, I of course mean Rest and ROMANCE.

There’s no denying the heat that’s building between Adrian and Bex, but rather than going down the steam or spice route, the book focuses on how pleasant, warm, and soothing blossoming affections can be. Each of them has found something special in the other—a piece that their lives have been missing—and something as simple as sharing mission updates or sharing a meal is draped with the golden glow of new attraction (turning undeniably into love, though neither of them can yet admit that aloud).

And then everything comes grinding to an agonizing halt when, in their most daring attack on Heaven, Bex makes the choice to save Adrian’s life rather than defeating an enemy and retaining a powerful strategic asset. Suddenly, she begins to question everything—and, expectedly, chooses to push Adrian away and lock down her own feelings.

The “will they, won’t they” aspect of the book is delicious and delightful. I had no idea whether the book would end in heartbreak or happiness (and I won’t spoil you by revealing which) but my poor romantic heart suffered through this entire book as I watched Bex try her best to push Adrian away to protect him—or, in truth, protect herself from the vulnerabilities that come from falling in love in the middle of a war.

I loved how Adrian, rather than getting sulky or petty (like would be the case in a darker, grimmer book), just goes about figuring out what went wrong, then has so much understanding and compassion for Bex’s struggles that you can’t help but love him even more.

The action is dialed up to the next level along with the romance. Now, Bex and her crew don’t just fight demons, but take on the Princes of Hell and their Princesses, too. The battles are faster-paced, more frenetic, and lead to greater revelations and epiphanies for the characters, and the settings (from an M.C. Escher-flavored corporate office to a superhighway-sized golden bridge into Heaven) are bigger and bolder.

And, by the end, we’re left (we hope) one step closer to Bex tearing down Heaven and dethroning the wicked King Gilgamesh from his throne. More mysteries are dangled (WTF is going on with Prince Leander? Who are the Blades really? How did a wrath demon learn to craft Excel spreadsheets?) and the foundation is laid for an exciting Book 3.

*Hell of a Witch* cements this series as one of my favorite urban fantasy series of the year. It keeps drawing me in with cooler magic, more intriguing worldbuilding, and characters that I fall in love with over and over.

I’m just gonna say it: *Hell of a Witch* is a Hell of a Book! ",fantasy
Recommendations for Kid-friendly epic fantasy?,"Hi, I want to introduce my younger brother who is 11 years old into the epic fantasy genre.

Therefore, I would like to know some kid-friendly epic fantasy.",fantasy
What are you planning to read for October and Halloween.,"I usually save up my horror-related reads for October, to get into the spirit of the season.  This year's books are:

**The Dreaming Jewels** by Theodore Sturgeon - SF/horror as a young boy with a secret runs away from home and joins a travelling carnival.

**The October Country** by Ray Bradbury - an October-themed short story collection.

**The Last House on Needless Street** by Catriona Ward - I don't know too much about this one but it got good reviews and has a bible-reading cat, so I'm in.

**The Broken Room** by Peter Clines.  An alcoholic ex-spy tries to protect a young girl who somehow remembers being one of his dead colleagues.

"Spanish Language Fantasy Published in 2024 (or Persian, Arabic, or Hebrew)","Hi all,

I asked this in the simple questions threads yesterday and didn't get any recommendations, but I'm looking for fantasy (or scifi, horror, magical realism, speculative fiction, etc) books published in Spanish in 2024.

It's for a Bingo challenge. I'm trying to read 25 books all originally written in a language that isn't English. For most squares, I'm doing an English translation. But for ""published in 2024"", I'd like to actually read a book originally published this year, not just translated this year. (I know that books translated into English in 2024 would count for the 2024 square. But I do want to challenge myself with reading at least one book this year written not in English.)

While I technically speak Spanish as a first language, growing up in the American school system meant I didn't get that much practice reading it, so I'm not the strongest reader of anything except English. I can just about read (and write) in Spanish at what I'd consider a high school level, so I'd prefer YA suggestions or anything not too complex or dense. If there's an audiobook to listen to, that'll also make it easier for me because I have a much easier time speaking and listening to Spanish than reading and writing it. 

For reference of where I think my reading level is at, I did The Raven Boys in Spanish fairly recently, and that was about perfect for me. I definitely read more slowly than I would have in English, which was *extremely* frustrating for me, but i didn't otherwise struggle with it at all. 

I do happen to also be close to fluent-ish in Persian, and I'm definitely fluent in Hebrew. I have never read anything substantial in those languages outside an academic setting where a teacher or professor helped us through it. However, I am fairly certain I can read something on the easier side meant for children or young adults. I also am learning Modern Standard Arabic right now, and I *think* I'm strong enough to start reading things more substantial than short stories and poems, so an easy Arabic book would also maybe work (as long as it's not written in a colloquial dialect). I imagine it's more likely that i get recommendations for Spanish language books published in 2024, but if anyone happens to have suggestions for Arabic, Hebrew, or Farsi books I'll give them a try.",fantasy
"What's your ""cheap"" writing telltale from fantasy authors?","For me it is the premise of ""every character is a witty and clever character and their speech portrays that"".

How do you feel (usually) about reading Goodreads reviews? ,"I’m loving a certain author named Guy Gavriel Kay… 

I’ve always known about Goodreads and have used it a bit, I went there this morning to read some of the reviews of a book of his I want to read called Tigana.

I then spent the next hour just reading Goodreads reviews for like… any other books I like randomly, or books I dislike.

Am I false for detecting a very **SEVERE** level of self importance and self worship in a lot of these reviews? Every other review seems to be me getting schooled on exactly *why* I’m not as intelligent as the reviewer and that my taste could never be as sophisticated.

Tell me I’m alone.

# [The Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49789629-the-year-of-the-witching)

&gt;**A  young woman living in a rigid, puritanical society discovers dark  powers within herself in this stunning, feminist fantasy debut.**  
In  the lands of Bethel, where the Prophet’s word is law, Immanuelle  Moore’s very existence is blasphemy. Her mother’s union with an outsider  of a different race cast her once-proud family into disgrace, so  Immanuelle does her best to worship the Father, follow Holy Protocol,  and lead a life of submission, devotion, and absolute conformity, like  all the other women in the settlement.  
But  a mishap lures her into the forbidden Darkwood surrounding Bethel,  where the first prophet once chased and killed four powerful witches.  Their spirits are still lurking there, and they bestow a gift on  Immanuelle: the journal of her dead mother, who Immanuelle is shocked to  learn once sought sanctuary in the wood.  
Fascinated  by the secrets in the diary, Immanuelle finds herself struggling to  understand how her mother could have consorted with the witches. But  when she begins to learn grim truths about the Church and its history,  she realizes the true threat to Bethel is its own darkness. And she  starts to understand that if Bethel is to change, it must begin with  her.

Has anyone read We Are The Dead by Mike Shackle? I'm confused about this setting . . .,"I'm only like 4 chapters in, but really struggling to understand the setting of this book, and was hoping someone could help me out.

Are the people of Jia supposed to be based on the japanese? There's some asian sounding names like Kiyosun for a city. Jia sounds asian. I think they refer to some flying demons as Daijuke or something. That sounds asian.

The cover has a japanese helmet mask. That's japanese for sure.

But outside of a few names, nothing else about these main people seems asian at all. They have names like Kaine, Tinnstra, and Dren for example. Nothing about them sounds asian at all. Their buildings are barely described. Their main weapons are a spear, shield and short sword. No mention of anything like a katana. They use bronze armor and fight in a phalanx. So far they sound more greek than anything asian. The author so far hasn't described a single character in anyway, which is annoying and hasn't helped. 

The mask on the cover isn't even for these Jians, I'm thinking. It's the bad guys, the Ergil. They fight with scimitars, but they are described as wearing skull type helmet masks. And these guys worship some god called Kage, which I think means darkness in Japanese (going off something in Ghost of Tsushima the game so could be totally wrong), and this god is the god of darkness.

So, is it really like a greek type of people with some location names that sound asian vs a people that is loosely based on the japanese?",fantasy
Books without boot licking?,"Looking for recommendations for fantasy books without any boot licking of a ruling class. This also includes lazily written oppression stories.

I have read/listened to hundreds of fantasy books and am really sick of all the low quality social commentary without any nuance or real point to be made.

Eg: Orphans shouldn't be hated on, Some very talented women should also be in the ruling class, some poor people are actually special or clever enough to be in the ruling class, the current king is terrible what we need is a new ""good king"", magical people are treated as second class citizen but actually they are ""better"".

I love good social commentary in fantasy, I think the genre is perfectly suited to exploring complex issues but 90% of what I've read is lazy at best. Authors seem to feel the need to have a poorly treated minority but ultimately the conclusion is to keep the system of oppression the same and just let the special characters through to their ""rightful place"" at the top, typically as a ruler themselves or some other head of office.

Examples of commentary done well IMO would be Terry Pratchett, Deidre Sullivan, Robin Hobb? (I can't think of any other well known authors).
Examples of it done badly in my personal opinion (It's a very unpopular opinion to not enjoy these authors so apologies if they are a favourite of yours and please don't downvote if you disagree) would be Trudi Canavan, Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rothfuss. The goblin emperor, Tigana (I really hate that book and could rant for hours about why). Virtually all books I've read with a criminal underworld.

I'd love recommendations for books with either no mention of a ruling class / oppressed minorities OR genuinely thought out and nuanced social commentary.
I think my bar for social commentary is relatively high (and is admittedly subjective) so I'm especially keen for recommendations for books with no focus on a ruling class or subjugated minority. They can exist in the world I just don't want it to be a theme of the book. Eg: Robin Hobb definitely has A LOT of boot licking but it isn't the main theme and at least for the main character it is a symptom of abuse and indoctrination. There is a prominent theme in the liveship traders but I think it's mostly done well.

I've been really enjoying books about hedge witches as they tend to not have hierarchical organisations.

Thank you in advance!

Cozy low stakes fantasy read,"Hi all, just looking for a recommendation for a cozy fantasy read. While I love series with a lot of scope to them, I feel like the blurbs I read are all doom and war or badly fleshed out worlds for people to get busy. 

An incomplete list of authors and series I love with passion and will reread forever:
Natasha Pulley absolutely everything
Robert Jordan WOT
George RR -never finish- Martin
Patrick -still hope- rothfuss
Madeleine miller
Brandon Sanderson - stormlight was great
Bridget Collins
Jennifer Fallon - tide lords only tbh
Brent weeks lightbringer especially
Neil -cancelled- Gaiman
Terry Pratchett

I won’t list things I’ve read but didn’t like, because I’ll start fights 😅

I love a fantasy that’s a bit quirky, doesn’t focus solely on war or not at all, has a sense of humor, the stakes don’t have to be high.

"12 series I've read and my thoughts on them, help me find my next one!","The best way to cope with the all-consuming emptiness that comes from finishing a good series is to start a new one, so I'd like your help picking one. Here are 12 different series I've read with some of my thoughts about them, ranked loosely from least to most favorite.

Some other books I've either partially read or haven't gone into here for various reasons are Malazan, ASoIaF, LotR, RotE, Harry Potter, Witcher, and the rest of Brandon Sanderson's work.

#Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros
I am not the target audience for this series. It feels like so much of what happens is done solely to set up the romance that everything must revolve around. The world and characters were interesting enough to keep me reading in spite of that, and I'll probably still end up reading the third book when it comes out. I guess I have a soft spot for magic college and ancient, powerful, grumpy dragons.

#Codex Alera by Jim Butcher
This series felt a bit more on the YA side than I'd prefer but I still enjoyed it. I enjoyed seeing Tavi rise to meet the challenges and responsibilities he faced. Medieval Rome meets Pokemon was a strange combination but it worked quite well. 

#First Law by Joe Abercrombie
This series is extremely well written and I remember the dialog being particularly well done. Characters are flawed, expectations are subverted, and tension is maintained in a way that kept me turning the page to find out what would happen next. Reading it also felt like getting kicked in the emotional nutsack over and over.

#Lightbringer by Brent Weeks
I enjoyed this series a lot, Kip was a likeable MC and Andross came out of nowhere to become one of my favorite characters. I disliked the veiled Christian apologetics/bible quotes and &gt;!literal deus ex machina!&lt; ending, but the worldbuilding and characters are interesting enough that it's a relatively minor complaint.

#Cinder Spires by Jim Butcher
Steampunk fantasy wasn't something I'd have thought I would enjoy so much. Rowl and the cats were a highlight and always put a smile on my face when they were ""on-screen"". With only two books released so far I'm excited to see where this story goes.

#Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss
It's a well-written story with great prose and the worldbuilding and it drew me in like few other series have. Piecing together the story as we're told what's happening by an unreliable narrator was something I found to be very satisfying.

#Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson
I absolutely love Vin as a protagonist. When I think about foreshadowing in books, era 1 Mistborn comes to mind as one of the best examples of doing it well. There were so many things that I felt I should have seen coming, but that still caught me off-guard all the same. Era 2 is also amazing. I'm excited to see how the world evolves as we jump to the next time period for Era 3.

#Alex Verus by Benedict Jacka
Verus blurs the line between hero and anti-hero in a satisfying way and I found his ruthlessness oddly refreshing. You don't always get a good option to pick, sometimes you have to take the least-bad one. I was initially put off by the idea of having the protagonist be ""weak"" in combat, but it was done so well that I absolutely loved it. The pacing is great and I couldn't stop reading once I started.

#Cradle by Will Wight
I just finished this series yesterday and absolutely loved it. When I think about why I love certain book series there are so many things that come to mind, be it prose, characters, story, environment, or any other number of things. But when I think about why I love Cradle, it's because reading it was pure unadulterated ***fun***. I just had a genuinely good time with this series.

#Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan
Tug your braids and smooth your skirts because this is a long series. Some people may not like the lengthy descriptions of what's happening but I found it incredibly immersive. With so much setup, the big moments hit so hard and will live in my head forever. The arcs of characters in this series are among the best I've ever read.

#Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
TWoK is probably my favorite single fantasy book. The story of Bridge 4 is one that I've come back to reread many times. The world is vast and alive, the characters have enjoyable arcs of progression and growth, and this series exemplifies so much of what I like about the fantasy genre. Book 5 can't come soon enough.

#Dresden Files by Jim Butcher
While this series starts slow, it builds up the world and its characters layer by layer as the series goes on. Characters make mistakes and learn from them, people make decisions and go on to suffer the consequences in future books. At some point you look back at how far these characters have come since you met them and have to take a moment to process it. The emotional highs and lows hit so hard because of how invested you become. I absolutely love this series.",fantasy

as of now, sword of kaigen and children of blood and bone are also on my mind but i would appreciate any other great recommendations you all may have. more modern series and authors would be appreciated! ",fantasy
Looking for female-lead stories in several mediums!,"Looking for female-lead non-horror non-comedy Audio Dramas/podcasts, Web/comics, Western animation and Anime

I'm looking for stories with a female protagonist, non-horror (or at least not too dark and scary), light sci fi/fantasy (set in the real world) with deep emotional themes and a complete story (or going or is planned to have a complete story for sure). 

Themes I enjoy are sisterhood, found family, protagonist aged 15-30; complex relationships, lesbian romance or LGBTQ characters, emotional rollercoaster with a good or bittersweet ending. Wholesome themes and triumph after harsh struggles. Supernatural/deep bonds of the soul, body or mind. Broad/passionate fanbase. Unique characters 

My favorite stories for comparison are Orphan Black and Life Is Strange 1 &amp; 3, Sense8, The OA, Undone

That Nostalgic Feeling a Book Leaves…,"What are some books you’ve read in the past that left an intensely nostalgic core memory - and how would you describe the feelings/thought they leave you with? There are specific books that I only need to think of their titles in order to be flooded with specific scents and certain emotions/mind states that nothing else can replicate and words fail me to describe…  What are some of yours and how would you describe them if you could?! 

I just read a post mentioning ‘The Cry of Icemark’ and I will never forget picking it up off my Scholastic store book shelf at elementary school and reading the first couple of chapters that turned it into a repetitive page turner that felt like warmth in a swath of ice and desolation. Or reading ‘The City of Ember’ for the first time which will always give me a slightly uneasy feeling I can’t shake. Another standout from childhood was ‘Inkheart’! 
In my adult years (though I don’t read AS much with the ever beckoning of my led-lit black holes) ‘Desperation,’ my first read by Stephan King brings a landscape of yellows, oranges and reds to my mind. ",fantasy
"A review of Zothique, by Clark Ashton Smith","I had vaguely heard of Clark Ashton Smith for a while, as the third (least? perhaps) titan of the Weird Tales magazine era of pulp fiction, standing beside Lovecraft and Howard. But his name kept cropping up as I investigated weird fiction, and he was even called by Fritz Leiber *sui generis*. So I entered his oeuvre with Zothique. I don't quite know the legality of things, with a series of stories published in the 30s which are probably in fair use, and collections which are from the 70s... But the stories ***can*** be found online, like the eldritchdark website (who seem to work with Smith's executors) and on the Internet Archive.

This was a fantastic collection of tales. I don't intend to review each story in full, because that would be far too long, but every story was really good; all with a good narrative, pacing and atmosphere, and concept. A great use of language, both good writing and tone-setting verbage, and satisfying in narrative arc. Each story was a full *story*, and pretty unique in its ideas and contents, despite their age and Smith's renown. I don't feel that it's really been ""copied,"" in my reading experience. They're firmly sword and sorcery, but with a tinge of horror and weird- it definitely feels like a fantasy read, but doesn't shy away from things going badly, or an end in which no one wins. Lots of rather strange and ineffable creatures and occurrences, and unique circumstances or setups compared to ""typical"" fantasies.

Smith brings unique premises to his tales. They all feel coherent, but together build one world. It's dark, and dim, and goodness rarely prevails. That's the where the horror creeps in, to me- good is equally likely to fail as evil. Tolkeinesque morals have no prevail here- evil and good have equal chance. Some of the monsters or encounters are downright weird- it's nothing one would encounter in any conventional RPG campaign or normal story. They are powerful, terrifying, and ineffable, even inscrutable. Lovecraft is said to have taken influence therein, and one can understand why. These books, though mostly sword and sorcery imo, are far from the norm which emerged.

I normally am averse to short story collections, so my recommendation should probably be seen as a higher recommendation. I did have some favourites: Xeethra set the tone well; Necromancy in Naat was tragically fun;  The Empire of Necromancers and the Master of Crabs were brief but fun; The Weaver in the Vault vas thoroughly weird, and the Dark Eidolon was a *fantastic* revenge tale.

Slow terrors and inscrutable voyages are the rest of the tales I read. I read the Ballantine collection from the 70s or so, but it does not seem easily available. But Ashton Smith, and my recommendation, send you forthwith.",fantasy

&gt;North America was never colonized. The United States and Canada don’t exist. The Great Lakes are surrounded by an independent Ojibwe nation. And in the village of Baawitigong, a Peacekeeper confronts his devastating past.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twenty years ago to the day, Chibenashi’s mother was murdered and his father confessed. Ever since, caring for his still-traumatized younger sister has been Chibenashi’s privilege and penance. Now, on the same night of the Manoomin harvest, another woman is slain. His mother’s best friend. The leads to a seemingly impossible connection take Chibenashi far from the only world he’s ever known.  
&gt;  
&gt;The major city of Shikaakwa is home to the victim’s cruelly estranged family—and to two people Chibenashi never wanted to see again: his imprisoned father and the lover who broke his heart. As the questions mount, the answers will change his and his sister’s lives forever. Because Chibenashi is about to discover that everything about those lives has been a lie.

4th book of INKHEART is coming out tomorrow and I'm just so excited to read it,"As you probably don't know (because every time  I mention it I get a bunch of excited replies) the 4th book from the Inkheart series comes out tomorrow in English. It's already out in Germany (for about a year). The English title for this book is ""The Colour of Revenge"".

It's been 10+ years since book 3, and I missed this series so much (I've re-read it a bunch of times). It was the series that made me love reading (and convinced me to keep a book under my pillow).

* For those who don't know the series: **Inkheart** is a middle grade series written by Cornelia Funke. It's about Meggie, a 12 year old girl who loves books and about her father Mo, a bookbinder. When Mo gets kidnapped by strange people from his past, Meggie, with the help of her aunt and her father's friend, sets out to an adventure to save him. Soon, it turns out that Mo has a magical ability, and that the villain - Capricorn - wants him to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

My ratings for each book in the series: 4/5 for Inkheart, 5/5 for both Inkspell and Inkdeath.

The story is amazing, very fairy-tale like, especially in second and third book, where characters travel to &gt;!the world inside book!&lt;. I also loved the quotes from different books every chapter, and illustrations from the author.

"What's an idea typically seen in other genres/media that you think would translate well to fantasy, but often isn't?","Just a shower thought, really. But I personally find myself enjoying any type of media significantly more if it uses a fantasy-esque setting, and I think many of you in this sub might feel the same. Sometimes when watching a movie, for example, I often end up thinking about how much more exciting I would find the plot if it were set in a fantasy world as opposed to a modern/futuristic/etc world.

The idea of a zombie apocalypse is so overdone at this point. Whenever I see an ad for something zombie apocalypse related, sometimes I think about how I would be much more intrigued if I was seeing a warrior type hacking through a horde of undead with a holy blade, instead of a guy shooting guns with seemingly unlimited ammo at zombies wearing ripped up Adidas shirts.

Zombies may be a poor example - I'm sure there's plenty of zombie apocalypse themes in fantasy, that's just the first thing that came to my mind.

Looking for recommendations on fantasy booking written in first person ,"Hello!

Recommendations for an adult who used to love fantasy as a kid,"Hi!

  
I got into reading as a kid, and fantasy was my favourite genre until I started university. Some of my favourite authors were Marianne Curley, Holly Black, Gail Carson Levine and Laura Gallego.

During university, I read GoT, and I enjoyed it. 

Recently, a friend insisted that I give fantasy another chance and recommended Elantris, as she loved it. I read it, and I found it engaging and a very quick, easy read. However, I was very disappointed by how superficial the character construction and political narrative are. It seems to be targeted more to a very young audience than to adults. For now, I do not think I will be giving Sanderson another chance, but I have felt a certain nostalgia for when I used to love fantasy.

"[Review] Jam Reads: The Wilding, by Ian McDonald","https://preview.redd.it/l8i85zug8zrd1.jpg?width=975&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af0e3859fb20773d0d4996bc467a3ebff63470e

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/the-wilding-by-ian-mcdonald)

*The Wilding* is a horror novel written by Ian McDonald, and published by Gollancz. A slow burn story that blends together elements from folk horror with a more modern terror, including a group of well-fleshed characters that are put in an extreme situation, becoming the prey of an ancient force.

Lough Carrow is a rewilding project in the depths of rural Ireland; Lisa, a Ranger that is longing to abandon this place, is taking a group of five kids and their three teachers for a sleepover night. However, after they are attacked by an unknown creature, they are forced to run deeper into the bog; progressively running into stranger manifestations, realising that the project has brought back something really ancient that is now hunting them.

In a first third of the novel, McDonald does an excellent job building the characters and preparing the atmosphere for the chaos that will be unleashed after; as a consequence, the initial part can be a bit rough in terms of pacing, but the payoff makes it worth-it. Lisa is a broken character after a traumatic event, that is alone in the world, and that however, will have to take the responsibility on this situation; a weight over her shoulders that, at many points, will logically take her to the border of collapse (I saw this novel comped with *Midsommar*, and I could see a bit of Danny in the character of Lisa). While the group that accompanies her is a bit secondary, I still enjoyed that, especially in the case of the children, they are fully developed, they are not just caricatures put there to die.

The atmosphere is excellently built, creating that oppressive and wild nature sensation that, when you are not in control, instils that fear of the unknown; McDonald weaves it together with folk elements to create an insuperable combination. As previously said, the pace is a bit of slow burn at the start, but once we overcome the first third, the story flows.

*The Wilding* is a great novel, especially if you want a modern take over folk horror; an excellent atmospherical proposal which I absolutely loved. I'm curious to see what brings McDonald in next novels!",fantasy
Looking for some recommendations for a novel/series within the Dark Fantasy/Fantasy genre,"Hello, I think this is my first time posting in this community and would be very grateful to get some recommendations. I will provide some insight into what I look for in books to maybe help out whoever decides to help me out

* No YA or teenage main character
* can be solo or group focused, but would preferably have a goal that must be completed, whether its personal or just a mission/decree.
* I am ok with romance, as long as it is written well and doesnt take up too much of the time
* Prefer a male MC
* Vulgarity and heavy themes do not bother me much
* Fantasy monsters and magic are always a very welcome addition
* No Gary stu/Mary stu tropes, I cannot stand a main character who is automatically a god at everything
*  I have read:
   * Abercrombie-&gt; enjoyed it heavily
   * Hedge Wizard-&gt; enjoyed it mildly
   * Kings of the Wyld -&gt; enjoyed it heavily
   * Super Supportive -&gt; enjoyed it heavily (though this is as close to enjoying a YA that I will ever come to)
   * Christopher Buehlman (Between two fires and Blacktongue thief) -&gt; enjoyed it heavily and mildly respectively
   * Various W40K novels -&gt; Only really enjoyed novels by Chris wraight, Dan Abnett and Guy Haley
   * R.Scott Bakker-&gt; only read the Darkness that comes before which I mildly enjoyed and never pursued the sequels, if they are worth it, please let me know.
   * Dresden Files-&gt; I've only read a few of them as they started to feel formulaic 
   * Philip K. Dick -&gt; read most of his stuff, so no need to recommend anything from his library, just thought I'de include him to help out whomever wants to concoct a recommendation for me
   * Stormlight Archives -&gt; mildly enjoyed, not gritty enough for me to give it a heavily enjoyed
   * I have also dabbled in litrpgs, though they have grown stale for me, and suffer from the Gary Stue/Mary Stu problem.
* My attempts at reading Series similar to and including Malazan have showed me that I can handle 6 POV characters max and anything beyond that and my interest starts waning.

I have tried to give as much information as possible on what I have read and what I've enjoyed, I hope somebody can provide me with a novel to fill my seemingly infinite current spare time. To maybe further help, Japanese light novels and Chinese web novels are a usually terrible fit for me considering how half the time the translation feels like you are reading a children's novel, but the only one I've enjoyed has been Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash.

Anyone else enjoyed reading fantasy book but not the fighting/big battle sequences?,"I find that more often than not, the supposedly 'climax' of the book where the big fight/battle/war take place, they are just mostly predictable sequences with a few predictable 'twists' thrown in there.

Village/Town hopping books?,"Greetings everyone,

Having recently reread The Eye of the World I've realized how much I enjoy the parts where Rand and Mat are running away from darkfriends, going from village to village to farmhouse etc. I also enjoy the One Piece style of storytelling where the crew goes to a new island, story happens and they move on.

Do you have any recommendations of books that follow a similar structure, where the main character or characters go from place to place, solving local problems or running away (maybe both)?

Overarching story like One Piece is welcome but not necessary, just that feeling of adventuring in new lands is what I'm looking for.

"Where I was on mirror shades and neon AKA ""What is cyberpunk""","https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2014/08/what-is-cyberpunk.html?lr=1727706639446

One of my favorite subgenres is also one of the most influential and, sadly, one of the ones whose roots have strayed furthest from its original source. I, of course, speak of the titular cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk influences all walks of fiction and even modern-day life but few people identify these elements as specifically from the genre anymore. In a very real way, we are living in a cyberpunk world. Nevertheless, cyberpunk is such an influential genre it created Gothic Punk (which gave rise to urban fantasy), steampunk, and numerous other builds as well as defined much of the contemporary or near-future science fiction of the past forty years.
Author Bruce Bethke coined the term cyberpunk for his 1983 short-story, appropriately titled Cyberpunk. The etymology of the word also indicates just what it is about. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute. Shakespeare, himself, used it several times and its vulgarity was part of its appeal. 

Punk music, started in the 1970s, was coined as a term for the garage bands of the day that would take on a defiant anti-establishment tone. Cyber is from the word cybernetic, which comes from the Greek adjective κυβερνητικός meaning skilled in steering or governing. Cybernetics is about technology and tools which interface with us humans.

What does Cyberpunk mean? Bluntly, it means getting ****ed by technology. In its raw essence, cyberpunk is a view of the world which means that technology will not make life better for humanity but only give the oppressor a different means of brutalizing the underclasses. It's not necessarily a technophobic genre, far from it, but it is an unromantic view of technology's power. 

If I may be so bold, the first cyberpunk novel may be R.U.R or Rossam's Universal Robots, a 1920 science fiction play by Karl Cabek depicting the oppression of living machines. The roots of technology not being a beneficent force but an oppressive one also shows up in Metropolis and the writings of Ardus Huxley. Huxley, in particular, gave a stunning view of a predominately clone-society ruled by worship of Henry Ford values of greed and industrialization in 1931's Brave New World.
The modern conception of cyberpunk is something entirely different, however, and owes its popularity to two primary sources: the works of William Gibson and the movie version of Bladerunner. Bladerunner provided the public with the view of a used-up science-fiction future where most of the work was performed by enslaved Replicants (androids so real they bleed, feel, and age). Most people were impoverished, sick, and living in the shadow of corporate ziggurats which were deliberately modeled after those of ancient Babylon.

William Gibson's works, particularly Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive created the idea of a massive sprawling civilization which had exaggerated almost cartoonish values of materialism and addiction to technology. Despite not knowing a thing about computers, William Gibson created the hacker-hero archetype with Chase and predicted the importance of safe data transfer with the protagonist of Johnny Mnemonic.

Cyberpunk would proceed to become an influence on animation, roleplaying games, fashion, movies, and video games. Among my favorite of cyberpunk works include the original Bubblegum Crisis, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hackers, the Deus Ex games, Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk 2020, Shadowrun, and The Matrix. There While the last straddles the line of cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk, being about a prophesied messianic figure, it still falls in the line of what the genre is all about. 

Cyberpunk is one of the first genres to forward style over substance. Fans of the genre often think of mirrorshades, trench coats, cybernetics, hacker heroes, ruthless megacorporations, epic poverty, and a general sense of doom brought about by societal collapse. This is all dross, however, for the real heart of the story. Which is man versus machine and society. 

Cyberpunk is unique in that it is very pro-technology but also extremely wary of it. Science and technology abound in cyberpunk fiction, to an almost-fetishized level, but the number of misuses from it are astounding. On a basic level, cyberpunk fiction must believe that technology will not make the world a better place. The flaw is in the human, rather than the machine, though. If technology solves humanity's problems or makes the world better then it is probably Post-Cyberpunk or simply science-fiction.
I've mentioned in previous articles the similarity of cyberpunk to noir fiction. In both settings, the corruption is endemic and irreversible. You may strike against the system, even score a few moral victories, but how much you may achieve is questionable. Any salvation the world may achieve is often through the destruction of the old without explaining what will come thereafter. 

Some cyberpunk works allow the machine to collapse thanks to the efforts of the protagonist, even if this usually comes with some form of cost. There is a strong anarchist sentiment to cyberpunk and it's not so much the protagonists have a better idea for how to run the world than anything would be better than the status quo. Even so, the protagonists may or may not believe in the positive ends they work toward.

The movie version of Johnny Mnemonic has Johnny struggle against his own extreme selfishness versus a larger social good. Despite the near-apocalyptic nature of the threat, Johnny has to be dragged kicking and screaming toward any positive end. Because of the noir sensibility, cyberpunk heroes tend to be loners and rebels. The flaws of these individuals are as intricate to realizing the setting as their merits. Decker, the protagonist of Bladerunner, is an individual who hunts Replicants for a living despite their apparent humanity. Case in Neuromancer is addicted, physically, to the internet. 

To live in the general dystopian worlds of cyberpunk and come away unphased will feel inauthentic to all but the deftest of writing. Genuinely noble souls, like Robocop's Alex Murphy, are often chewed up and spit out by the world--forcing them to rebel because society won't allow them to be good.
The villains of cyberpunk are typically part of the establishment. They need not be actively malevolent but enforce a status quo which oppresses and dehumanizes. Corporations are a favorite villain in the medium, representing the unchecked growth of greed and profit better than almost any other group. They are not the only sort of villains which can serve as cyberpunk foes, however. Corrupt governments, organized crime, and even mad scientists are all viable enemies for cyberpunk stories.
Paul Verhoven's Robocop created one of the most perfect cyberpunk villains in the despicable megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Omni Consumer Products destroys the life of noble police officer Alex Murphy, feeds off the misery of Detroit's population like a parasite, and ruins more lives via its business policies than ""normal"" criminals could ever hope to match. 

OCP's not an uber-efficient evil empire, though, but a bloated fat dragon whose members are so obsessed with their bottom line they're actually incompetent. OCP does as much damage through cost-cutting as they do through any plans which work. This is embodied by the robot ED-209, which is at once highly dangerous and pathetic. The cool efficiency of many science-fiction villains is absent from cyberpunk as not even the cause of evil is immune to the slow decay of the world.
While the genre was most famous in the Eighties, Reagan economics combining with new trends in globalism as well as mechanization, the world has actually become far closer to the globally integrated but poverty-stricken vision scene in the writings of many writers. Computers are ubiquitous, data is taken from us everywhere, and the wealthy are in bed with the ruling class--so only some things are changing. This means cyberpunk is more relevant now than ever but less distinct from daily reality. 

The Watch_Dog video games and popular television show Mr. Robot are both distinct cyberpunk works about rebels fighting against the corruption of the world around them with computer knowledge. They also take place in the quote-unquote real world. Contemporary society is something fully capable of hosting cyberpunk stories now. My own Agent G series is base around how the modern day ends up becoming a chrome and mirrorshades dystopia. 

So, what is the appeal of cyberpunk? In a very real way, it is the allure of raging against the machine. An individual may not be able to make the world a better place, but he might be able to strike against the oppressor. Everyone loves a rebel, and cyberpunk is an excellent way to exaggerate existing trends before sending your protagonists against them.",fantasy

Tarvolon's Magazine Minis: Asimov's and Lightspeed,"My short fiction reviews over the last couple years have been almost entirely limited to two monthly posts: [a review of the magazines I read cover-to-cover](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1fk1md8/tarvolon_reads_a_magazine_or_two_reviews_of/) and a catch-all roundup with an assortment of everything else. But in 2024, I've been trying to be a little more consistent in my reading of magazines that aren't necessarily getting cover-to-cover reads. And so I'm going to add a third short fiction review post, providing a mini-spotlight on some venues that aren't at the tippy top of my TBR but are still very much worth a read.

These aren't proper magazine reviews, because *Clarkesworld* is the only magazine that has impressed me so consistently that I'm reading everything that hits their table of contents. Instead, these are spotlights on some of the other magazines that I regularly browse, chosen in the instances where I've read a significant enough portion of one or two issues that it's worth breaking away from the miscellaneous short fiction roundup into something a little bit more focused. Today, I'll be looking at a total of ten stories I read across two issues of *Lightspeed* (August and September 2024) and one issue of *Asimov's* (September/October 2024).

# Asimov's

The [September/October 2024 issue of *Asimov's*](https://www.asimovs.com/current-issue/) features five novelettes and eight short stories, and there were six that really caught my attention, through some combination of positive reviews, author recognition, and strong opening paragraphs.

That started with a pair of ghost stories, including the first short story of the issue, **Art Deco Farmhouse, Original Hardwood Floors, Slightly Haunted** by Alice Towey, featuring a freshly single protagonist realizing his new(ish) farmhouse is haunted by a ghost who seems increasingly agitated by his newfound lack of direction. It's not a story that necessarily breaks new ground, as ghosts that are overly invested in the mortal world aren't even unique in this issue, let alone in genre fiction, but it has a nice hook to start and provides some satisfying moments along the way.

The other ghost who can't let go of the world features in one of the issue's shortest stories, **An Unplanned Hold** by Zohar Jacobs. This one is told from the perspective of the ghost himself, wandering around Houston and checking in on developments in the space program to which he'd dedicated so much of his life. Again, this is not necessarily groundbreaking, but it's a strong character exploration in a compact space, coming together for a heartwarming finish.

One of the reasons I even bought this issue in the first place was seeing Ray Nayler's name on the table of contents. Over the past few years, I've loved his work more often than not, and **A Gray Magic** did not disappoint. It's not a story that will appeal to everyone, lacking both a strong central plot and the kind of twist that tends to grab attention. Instead, it's the quiet tale of a terminally ill woman examining her life before it ends. That life is unsatisfying in many ways--from a family that never seems to care like they should to a workplace that demands much and supports little--so it's not a happy story, but it's a poignant one with enough flashes of hope to prevent it from feeling truly bleak.

R.P. Sand is another author I've enjoyed a lot in the past, and **Eternity is Moments** also includes reflections on often-unsatisfying familiar relationships. From start to finish, the story repeatedly refrains ""I met my grandfather today"" in a way that almost feels like poetry, cutting quickly from each assertion of meeting to memories of past interactions, slowly unveiling the portrait of a relationship with real love behind it that was nevertheless fraught in many respects. The interpersonal story is expertly done, weaving so many moments together into something truly powerful. The ending comes a little quickly for my tastes, but that hardly undercuts what is easily my favorite of the short stories I read in this issue.

Neither of the two novelettes I read jumped out at me from the first couple lines, but I've had enough enjoyment reading Naomi Kritzer that I wasn't going to miss **The Four Sisters Overlooking the Sea** unless the opening actively pushed me away. And I'm immensely glad that I let my past experience be my guide here, because this one starts with a little bit of slice-of-life scene-setting to establish the setting before growing into the story it would become. And the story it becomes is tremendous. It's not one that's there to awe the reader with big twists--it takes a little bit for the reader to understand what kind of story this is, but once the background is established, it's not hard to see the ending coming--but it's so skillfully told that it had me on the edge of my seat waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's engaging from start to finish, with the speculative element dovetailing beautifully with some down-to-earth marital conflict to create one of my favorite novelettes of the year.

**And to Their Shining Palaces Go** by Betsy Aoki is a standalone novelette set in the Many Worlds shared universe pioneered by Cadwell Turnbull. It features an Earth conquered by an alien race that uses a massive virtual reality game to study the human race. The lead has been raised under occupation, and she's ecstatic to take a prestigious position working for the aliens in game design. But her parents, who remember freedom, aren't so excited. And life under the shining alien dome is more complicated than she expected, dealing with factions among both their alien overlords and those who serve. It's a long novelette, but there's so much going on that I think this story may have warranted a full novella, as there are so many different conflicts, and the plot can at times feel like a whirlwind.

# Lightspeed

Let me start by mentioning that *Lightspeed* is offering [three-month free trial subscriptions](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/make-the-jump-to-lightspeed/). If you're interested, now is a perfect time to check them out!

Each issue of *Lightspeed* contains four sci-fi and four fantasy stories, half of which are flash fiction. For most people, that's eight things to read, but as an avowed flash hater, that means that there are effectively four stories for me to explore each month, and there were two that caught my eye in both the August and September issues.

The August issue opens with a classic time travel story, **The Darkness Between the Stars** by Richard Thomas, featuring a teenager who stumbles upon a time machine and finds himself careening out-of-control from time to time to time, with the various emergences tending more toward horror than wonder. It's not a new premise, but it's told in a way that immediately sucked me in and quickly built emotional investment, but time travel stories tend to rely heavily on the ending, and it didn't feel quite fresh enough to live up to the strong start.

The other sci-fi short story in the August issue is **The Quality of Mercy is Not Strain'd** by Archita Mittra. This one is also told in moments separated by years, though in this case both objective and subjective years. It features a second-person lead who undergoes more and more body modification to extend life and keep a job that you don't even like. But a chance meeting with an old bot sets life on a different course, a series of small moments that ultimately turn into big ones. There's a solid arc here, but despite my usual penchant for second-person narratives, this one kept me a little bit too distant from the emotional impact of the narrative.

In the September issue, I picked out one sci-fi and one fantasy short story. The sci-fi tale I read was **Reconstructing “The Goldenrod Conspiracy,” Edina Room, Saturday 2:30-3:30** by Gabriela Santiago, which immediately drew me in with the setup, formatted as a lecture at a convention dedicated to an in-universe sci-fi show. This version of Earth has quite a different political structure, with many real-world nations fragmented into smaller states, many of which seem to have significant authoritarian streaks. One episode of a Canadian TV show is thought to be lost forever until small clips are discovered in the records of censors in various polities. And so they try to piece together a plot, along with plenty of speculation about how it fits in context and more than a bit of musing about the censors. It's a really interesting setup, but not one that necessarily wows with a moment of convergence. I expect this may have some extra appeal for readers who are deeply involved in fandom discourse.

The fantasy story I read was **We the People Excluding I** by Osashon Ize-Iyamu, written from the perspective of someone who volunteers for a lifetime exile after a leader identifies it as a way to heal the many dangers plaguing their people. But as time passes, it becomes clear that it's not quite so simple, and conflict with the man who demanded the exile is inevitable. The result is a solid, compact adventure fantasy with a likable lead character.

Update on Ian Irvine: Author of the Three World Cycle. ,"I got permission from the author himself to share this. 

  
Hi r(removed my name) 

Thanks for asking, that’s kind of you. Yes, all is very well, thanks, and my apologies for going silent. And I hope all is well with you, too.

 

I’ve been doing a lot of writing, though on different stuff – I decided I needed a complete change from epic fantasy for a while.

 

1. I’ve spent over a year working on a screenplay (26 drafts!) with my son Simon, who’s a highly experienced movie animator/SFX guy (*2**^(nd)* *Hobbit Movie, Spiderman, The Gray Man, Mary Poppins Returns* etc) and also has a terrific grasp of movie storytelling. It’s loosely based on a kid’s book I wrote a long time ago and, if it gets made, would be a 3D-animated Christmas fantasy adventure comedy. For those who are interested, here’s the website, [https://the-last-christmas.com](https://the-last-christmas.com/) and it has links where people can download the first part of the screenplay, and the Pitch Deck which summarises the story and the team. We’re currently working on some concept art and other things.
2. I’ve written a fantasy adventure (*The Dark Lady Rises*) set in a different version of our world, which my agent is marketing to publishers. It’s an alternate history fantasy duology largely set in the modern world. I developed the story concept from Sir Isaac Newton’s well-known studies of alchemy and the arcane – and my supposition that he was led into temptation, by the insatiably curious Sculptor, to decipher the laws governing the forbidden, dark side of magic. The story is set in 2005, in a world radically changed from ours. I can send more info if you like.
3. And I’ve just finished outlining a fantasy crime thriller (*Kill, my Darling!*) set in the same world but a bit earlier (1973). I’ve never written crime fiction before, and I’m loving it. I’ll be starting it first thing tomorrow.

 

Feel free to post any of this if you wish.

 

Cheers,

 

Ian",fantasy
TOP 3 Fantasy Book Series,"Here's my Top 3 from best to worst:

**1. Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman**

Books: 
- Dragons of Autumn Twilight
- Dragons of Winter Night
- Dragons of Spring Dawning
- Time of the Twins
- War of the Twins
- Test of the Twins

The first six Dragonlance books are flawless masterpieces in my opinion. The characters are relatable and the drama with epic and tragic plot beats are unbeatable. The books never drag and every chapter ends in a way you want to keep on reading. Unlike many other series, the saga sticks its landing perfectly. I first read the series as a teenager, but it's still as good as it was all those years ago. The books are kind of romantic. There's no useless swearing or profanity, and I love it. Finally, Raistlin Majere is one of the best characters in fiction.

**2. Deathgate Cycle by Weis and Hickman**

Books: 
- Dragon Wing
- Elven Star
- Fire Sea
- Serpent Mage
- Hand of Chaos
- Into the Labyrinth
- Seventh Gate

Deathgate offers incredible worldbuilding. The four elemental worlds are interesting as we, the readers delve into their mysteries. Weis and Hickman once again provide great characters and epic storytelling with lots of plot twists and dramatic sequences. The series only lose to Dragonlance because the final book is not on par with the rest of them. At any rate I still fully recommend this awesome series. 

**3. Dark Tower by Stephen King**

Books:
- Gunslinger
- Drawing of Three
- Wastelands
- Wizard and Glass
- Wolves of Calla
- Song of Susannah
- The Dark Tower

Yet another seven part saga, but this time from the master of horror. Dark Tower is more ""mature"" (if you believe swearing and detailed sexual scenes are mature) and its world is grimdark, but it's also a masterfully imaginative journey. The books combine western, sci-fi, fantasy and horror and contains connections to a bunch of other books by King. Some books drag quite a lot and the main villain is anticlimatic, but Stephen King's magnum opus is ultimately more than worth it. Also, the main character Roland Deschain is cool as f**k.

"What are some fantasy books that made you feel ""wow, I learned a lot from that""?","I've realized that I personally enjoy books that teach me something. It's like I get a jolt of dopamine when I read a story and learn about something I never knew before, whether it's a scientific idea, new culture, sociological concept, military tactics, etc. Are there any fantasy books you've read that made you feel that way?

What do you want to see more in fantasy/sci-fi TV shows?,"I have an idea for a show (a blend of fantasy, sci-fi and family drama), but before I sit down and actually write the pilot, I want to know what people want/wish to see more in the shows overall.  Some specific tropes/characters/arcs? Thanks for suggestions.",fantasy
Are there any fantasy creatures that are also simultaneously an environment or are sort of embedded or covering their environment?,"I'm wondering if you guys know of any creatures similar to this?  
  
Odd question maybe but I was reminded of the Elder God character from the Legacy of Kain series, as well as Zephon from Soul Reaver 1, both of which are monstrous characters that have grown all over their environments. The first one is a sort of Lovecraftian inspired thing which has the appearance of an ooze-like growth of eyes and tentacles, and Zephon is a vampire whose body over the centuries kept growing into a huge mass that ends up coverign the interior of a cathedral-like structure.

There's also the Leviathan Seeds from Metroid Prime 3 which are essentially living asteroids that carry a mutagenic poison that infects planets. It's essentially a planet-devouring parasite that spreads to other planets via destroying it's host planet and sending it's splinters to new planets to infest.

I'm currently thinking of oozes, mosses and fungi as far as living creatures that spread over their environments in some way. Then there's the fleshy/toothy versions of hell that you sometimes see depicted on something like death metal album covers or something you would encounter in Doom games, but this is perhaps not really a specific creature.

Do you guys have other examples or ideas?",fantasy
Books where MC crosses some internal moral line/code? ,"A lot of protagonists will have typical ""no killing"" or ""murder is wrong"" viewpoints, but I'm wondering if you all have any recommendations for books where the MC is pushed to the point of breaking their own morals? 

Would prefer if this results in the MC becoming more of a morally grey character rather than just being a one-off incident. Thanks!",fantasy
Do you know any apocalypse fantasy or sci-fi that have a hopeful take on humanity?,"Usually the premise of mainstream apocalypse shows, games and books like Last of Us and Walking Dead is that a calamity brings out the worst in people and even with an existential threat the survivors are plagued with infighting, raiding and warlords grasping for power.

I think its a fair outcome but I also like to believe there is an equally high chance of humanity uniting under an apocalyptic threat and forgo greed and ambition and social class and focus on the greater good. So despite the dire and grimdark situation there is also an uncanny beauty in this world in how united the people are in spirit and cause and the only real enemy is the calamity itself and not other people.

What I liked about Mistborn was that the magic was extremely simple and well explained, the story was grounded despite covering the whole continent, the changing perspectives makes every chapter feel fresh and I absolutely ADORE the character relationships. I loved how larger than life characters seemed and (most of the time) characters wouldn't need to travel for weeks to talk to eachother. I also loved the twists and turns. I never managed to predict the ending of any of the books.

Help rescue me from my (short) reading slump,"**TL;DR**: I've read quite a bit in fantasy, some in sci-fi, and the last four books have been pretty disappointing. I am hoping for something good to recover from this bad streak.

I’ll try to give reference to books I like, name the books I have not liked, and try to give reasons for not liking them. I find it harder to explain what I like about books / what I’m specifically looking for… Because I feel like I’m open to many things, whether that's true or not.

Disclaimer: I'm not trying to say the books I didn't like are bad. I just couldn't get into them.

Books and series I’ve really liked / loved recently:

* *Mistborn* (era 1 and 2) by Brandon Sanderson
* *Stormlight Archive* by Brandon Sanderson
* *Warbreaker* by Brandon Sanderson
* *Cosmere Secret Projects* by Brandon Sanderson
* *Wheel of Time* by Robert Jordan
* *The Kingkiller Chronicle* by Patrick Rothfuss
* *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams
* *The Lies of Locke Lamora* by Scott Lynch

Books and series I DNF’d recently and really couldn’t get into:

* *Red Seas Under Red Skies* by Scott Lynch
* *The Priory of the Orange Tree* by Samantha Shannon
* *Hyperion* by Dan Simmons
* *Gideon the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir

I really like Sanderson’s writing and books, absolutely love Rothfuss’ writing, and even Douglas Adams and Robert Jordan are great. All these books felt *absolutely effortless* to read and I loved every second. *Gentleman Bastard* series felt like a slog - the first book was good enough, but felt like an effort to read and I couldn’t finish the second book. *The Priory of the Orange Tree* and *Gideon the Ninth* felt just kind of off, somehow just didn’t pull me in with the writing and characters and plot. *Hyperion* felt very old school writing or something, I really didn’t like it. Similarly, I have tried reading *Lord of the Rings*, *The Hobbit*, and *Dune* in the past and have felt them to be stuffy and tedious.

I’m not confident in what I’m looking for exactly. I suppose I might be more into realistic / grim, non-romantic, good characters, humor…

Currently I am leaning towards *The Sun Eater*, *The First Law*, *Bloodsworn Saga*, or *The Dandelion Dynasty*. However, feel very hesitant since the past four attempts at what I thought would be great reads went poorly. So I would like to hear what some thoughts are on what might be a good next book or series.",fantasy

"Books involving trade routes, caravans or trading cities?","I'm a fan of worlds with diverse cultures and a feeling that the society has grown organically.

Are merchant princes going to revolt if the king starts an inconvenient war? Is there any cultural exchange beyond food? Things like that.

Monocultures are less interesting to me. Their worlds feel small. I guess I'm biased because I like to read about ragtag protagonists on quests or heists, which usually involve travel.

What I really want are some good examples and/or recommendations for epic fantasy novels or series (*no contemporary settings, please*) that give male and female characters ample opportunity to shine, and that write them as people rather than as part of a mysterious, untrustworthy ""Other."" Commentary on the growing socio-political ""gender divide"" in our society has me a bit down in the mouth, and a good antidote for me would be to read, or at least talk about (if I happen to have already read them), stories in which male and characters are at least close to equally important, and -- this is vital -- in which they *get along*, not just as love interests but as friends and allies. I honestly want to see men and women not only being awesome, but enjoying each other's company.

Perhaps the clearest example of the kind of thing I'm talking about would be John Gwynne's *The Bloodsworn Saga*. In each of the three heroic points of view, male and female characters interact regularly, and even if they don't respect each other right away, 1) they soon come to, and 2) what initial disrespect there might be is not due to gender. Another example: R.J. Barker's *The Bone Ships*. Before anyone suggests *The Wheel of Time*, a very long series in which the male and female characters spend 80% of the time hating each other's guts is not what I'm seeking. Battles of the sexes are precisely what I *don't* need right now.

My 2024 Book Bingo Card and Reviews!,"https://preview.redd.it/gdedpt2hmrrd1.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1713e46b03ec6fd69f22e78bb3ae5a6d96c49148

I'm happy to have completed my bingo card for 2024! Once again I completed it just using my library. Fortunately my library is great because they order books for me. Beware spoilers in the the reviews below. The hardest square for me to fill was certainly Alliterative title, two words was easy to find, but I found several of the three word titles I had already read. Also for some reason I always leave the Book Club book for last. This was my first year doing a full hard mode bingo card, which I think I will do again just for the challenge. I considered switching to an all female author card, when I realized how many of the authors just happened to be female. However I decided to just keep it as I had it. A challenge for next year, perhaps?



First in a Series HM

Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children Ransom Riggs 3.5/5

I liked the use of photography throughout the book. Jacob was a likeable character, and I liked the handing of the after affects of Jacob witnessing his grandfather’s death. I didn’t find the book spooky. It was weird his love interest was his grandfather’s girlfriend.

 

Alliterative Title HM

Marion Lane and the Midnight Murder 2.5/5

This was the hardest book for me to get for my bingo square. Lots of two words, but three that I hadn’t already read was difficult to find. Marion has lived with her grandmother since her mother died and they have a difficult relationship. She is apprenticing at a secretive detective agency with a cover of working at a bookstore. Based on the cover I would have thought it was based in the 1800’s, but it’s based in 1958 London. I thought it was interesting it talked about the pressures she faced from her grandmother to marry, but no discussion of sexism in the workplace at that setting. I guess the assumption is since the agency was founded by a woman there is no sexism within it. I would have liked more examples of Marion being smart, there was a lot of her finding things by accident. I just didn’t care about the plot or the characters. I won’t be continuing the series.

 

Under the Surface HM

A Letter to the Luminous Deep- Sylvie Cathrall 5/5

E and Henerery Clel strike up a friendship then eventual romantic relationship through letters, and their siblings share their letters after their death in an attempt to grieve. This world has developed into three different scholarly societies a thousand years after the people were stranded on the ground. The world has very little land so a tidal, ship, and one land-based society has emerged. E lives underwater and has agoraphobia or something similar.  I liked the epistolary format; it was a good way to show the past and present. I really enjoyed all the characters, they all seemed so wholesome. The adventure at the end of the book does seem to be a departure from the meandering slice of life type plot for the first ¾ of the book.

 

Criminals HM

The Sky on Fire- Jen Lyons  3/5

Anahrod is a criminal out of necessity. She was supposed to be executed as a teenager due to her families’ actions, but she survived. Now as an adult she is living exiled in anonymity, after she is kidnapped, she attempts to escape multiple ways and then is forced into helping with a heist of a dragon’s hoard. In this universe dragons not only exist but control their dragon riders and have vast political power. I read the first book of the ruin of kings series by this author, but honestly can’t say I remembered anything about it. I was annoyed that of course she immediately lusts after one of her captors Ris. At least the character pointed out her repeated kidnappings was getting ridiculous. I know lots of fantasy has unique names, but this book went all out with the character and place names. It reads like a YA. Now I usually complain that YA is written like the characters are 30, but in this the character is 32, but it if you changed it to 18, I would say this book is YA. Does that make sense? This book was ok, found it average.

 

Dreams

The Fireborne Blade – Charlotte Bond HM  4/5

Maddileh is a knight who  was banished after she caused a scene when her love interest humiliated her publicly. She is attempting to retrieve a blade from the lair of a dragon to return to good graces with the King. This is a shorter read, it nice not to read just bricks all the time. The dreams are nightmares about dying from fire, which seems relevant while hunting dragons. I liked that those killed by dragons turned into ghosts, it is a unique idea. The story is interspersed with past tales of dragon hunts.I did not expect the twist at the end, I appreciated it.

 

Entitled Animals

I’m Afraid you’ve got Dragons – Peter S. Beagle 5/5

I really enjoyed this! Was a heartwarming classic fairytale. Robert is a dragon exterminator, and hates killing the dragon’s and would rather learn to be a valet. A unique take on dragons in this story, they are just pests, until of course the bigger dragons come out. I liked the twist with his Robert’s character. I found the characters nuanced and mostly likeable, Princess Cerise wasn’t helpless, Prince Reginald had some depth, Roberts friends were loyal and not just tropes.

 

Bards

Raven’s Shadow- Patricia Briggs 3.5/5

Tier is a retired soldier returning home from war. On his way he encounter and saves Seraph. She is a traveler- which are the outcasts in society and has magic. Tier likes to sing and tell stories, but Seraph informs him he is a bard, and his voice has magic as well. Tier doesn’t want to follow his family and become a baker, they marry, and he becomes a farmer. There is a time ship to their children almost being grown and Tier goes missing. I wasn’t expecting the sudden chapter from the emperor’s point. This would work for multi POV as well, I think HM. The narrative switched between his family trying to find Tier, and his captivity. I was kind of sad there was no real focus on their relationship, they were separate most of the time. Also, this is book is older but the whole grossness of a grown man marrying a 16 year old was barely discussed. I think I will read the next book in the duology, but I felt like it could have ended in one book.

Prologues and Epilogues

Sweet Nightmare Tracy Wolff 3/5 HM

  
I have heard nothing about this book ahead of time, I just saw it available at my library. To start off this reminds of the Wednesday Addams Netflix show. Which I did like so hopefully this lives up to that. Clementine’s mother runs the school for misfits and paranormals. Clementine herself is a manticore, but the school restricts all the students from using magic. The book doesn’t do a good job explaining what the different student’s powers are. Also her bad relationship with her mother came off as shallow, her mother is just cruel with no explanation or deeper qualities. The love interest is the trope of I left you to protect you. Clementine can see ghosts. I’m not sure if it was just the ebook format, but the short chapters annoyed me. I would have liked the book more if I cared about the romance more, but there was too many tortured I can’t be with you moments, and not enough cute moments showing why they are good together.

 

Self-Published HM

In the Society of Women Krista D. Ball 4/5

This book was on my TBR for a while and I was very happy not only fit this into Bingo, but that my library had it. This is the third installment of the series and Elizabeth is busy wrangling her sisters as usual when her aunt’s health takes a turn for the worse, and she must go to London to help care for her. The book is focused on the family’s day to day life and dramas. I was hoping Mr. Sinclair and Elizabeth would develop a romance, but it is a very slow burn. Looking forward to the next book.

 

Romantasy

Can’t Spell Treason Without Tea- Rebecca Thorne HM 4.5/5

Reyna a queen’s guard and Kianthe an important mage escape their past lives to open a bookshop/teahouse. This is marketed as cozy fantasy and it is reminiscent of Legends and Lattés, but I would saw it has non cozy plot. They are trying to lay low from the Queen’s spies, and solve the dragon attack problem, which isn’t that cozy. The romance was a big part of the plot, and I liked that it started with them already as a couple. It’s an example of a couple with good communication. Would also work as epilogue, alliterative title, and first of a series. If you get it as a physical copy, the blue pages are beautiful, I am super happy my library ordered it for me. I will continue reading the series.

 

Dark Academia

An Education in Malice S.T Gibson HM 3.5/5

Laura is entering a writing program for university at Saint Perpetua. Carmilla is an older student and Laura’s love interest and rival. Their professor and mentor Dr. De Lafontaine is basically grooming them. I should have guessed the vampire connection, as I did read the dowry of blood by the author, but this time it is lesbian vampires. I was surprised the vampire reveal happened so soon. Before Carmilla was turned into a vampire the book was just fine. Too much receiving poetry for me. After the change it was a lot more interesting. I was surprised there was so little baby vampire training content. I was reading this on a plane which was a little awkward with all the sex. Didn’t want my seatmate seeing haha. The 60’s setting didn’t effect much, was just background. The happy ending was a turn I didn’t see coming.

 

Multi POV HM

Sunbringer Hannah Kaner 4/5

This is the second in a series where gods compete for and survive by people’s worship. The group of characters are caught up in the god’s struggle. This fits for character with a disability as well. Kissen, who is a god killer lost a leg in the tragedy that killed her family when she was a child.

 

Published in 2024 HM  
To Gaze Upon Wicked Gods Molly X Chang 2.5/5

I didn’t enjoy this one. The plot was predictable. The first 100 pages of the book introducing the world was the best part. It seemed like generic YA fantasy with a romance plot with the girl falling for the evil guy. The weirdest part for me was that she trusted him pretty much immediately after a few speeches despite all the evidence to the contrary. Also are we supposed to be hoping for this couple to make it? It wasn’t compelling at all. Of course she switched sides of the very end of story to set up the sequel.

 

Character with a Disability

Dead Collections- Issac Fellman 4/5 HM

Sol is a trans man that has vampirism. This was an interesting take on vampires. Its set up as a disability or illness. He will die from it eventually, in this world is not a pathway to eternal life. He is an archivist that falls in Love with Elise when she brings in her dead wife’s book and collection. Most of the plot is him dealing with the difficulties that vampirism brings him, dealing with his job, and his vampirism starts affecting the archive. This book had a unique format some of it was written as a script, had excerpts from tv shows and included text chains and emails. I liked the romance, but it was a very fast falling in love.

 

Published in the 90’s

By the Sword- Mercedes Lackey- 4/5 HM

I had read a main trilogy of Valdemar books, but this is a standalone, which is good because I don’t think I remember much of the trilogy. Kerowyn goes to rescue her new sister in law when her family is attacked at a wedding. To accomplish this, she bonds with her grandmother’s magic sword, which can take over control of her body. After she returns home victorious, she realizes she doesn’t fit in with the restrictions of noble female life. Training montage ensues ! Then it times skips to her as a working mercenary. She rescues a captive herald and falls in love with him, then leaves him in part to save him and in part pessimistic that their relationship wouldn’t work. Another time skip to her in charge of a mercenary troop. I liked this book, but I did find at the end it got a little too focused on the battles. Of course she does end up in a position to be with her love at the end.

 

Orcs HM

How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying- Django Wexler 3.5/5

Davi, is a young woman from our world, that got stuck in a fantasy world time loop where she has to save the world. After 2000 years of trying, she decides to join the dark side instead and become the Dark Lord. This could also fit for survival HM. Every time she dies, she starts again at the same starting point like a video game. She joins her adversaries from her past lives, the wilders, a lot of which are orcs. Including her love Interests Tsav. It was a fun read.

Space Opera HM

Nophek Gloss- Essa Hansen 3/5

Caiden’s family is slaughtered after he is taken from his home planet. He stumbles into a crashed ship and a group that helps him. Caiden wants revenge on the slaver’s who killed his family. It was weird some of the adults blamed a child when he made bad decisions like 24 hours after living through basically a genocide. I did like that the usual training montage of the character learning fabulous skills was replaced by technology that aged him six years at once, and installed in him all the knowledge and skills he needed. Unique way to handle it. I thought the book was average, there are a lot better space opera. I won’t continue to the next book.

 

 

Author of Colour HM 3/5

Of Jade and Dragons- Amber Chen

Ying is the rebellious daughter that would love nothing more than to join the engineer guild if society allowed her to. After her father is killed, she disguises herself as a boy and sets off to get revenge on the killer. Its an Asian YA fantasy inspired partially by Mulan and had some steam punk elements. There are air ships! Of course, the love interest is a young prince. I did like that the prince knew about her ruse right away rather than the plot being the conflict of him not knowing. I wish there was more delving into the fantasy elements. The same plot could of easy been set in a non-fantasy world. I thought the book was fine, I wasn’t rooting for the relationship.

 

Survival HM

The Morningside Tea Obreht 3/5

Silvia and her mother, move in with her Aunt, in an abandoned apartment building in a post climate apocalypse world. She learns about her families past and begins to obsess and create a fantasy life about another tenant in the building. Silvia is a child, but the book is not written with an immature view and is certainly not a children/YA book.I thought it was interesting that the language her family speaks was only called “Ours” and the city they had left was a stand in for Belgrade. I didn’t know that though from context, that is what google says. The last quarter of the book seemed to be a departure from most of the plot and there was a big time jump. I just thought the book was okay. The survival aspect was set in a post climate apocalypse world but really could have been any poor family trying to survive in any time period. I did like the quirk that eating meat was taboo though. The book would also fit in the published in the 2024 bingo square as well.

 

Book Cover HM

The Seventh Veil of Salome-  Silvia Moreno-Garcia  4/5

I do find it hard to pick a book by its cover without at least reading the blurb, but I noticed this cover in the new book section at my library and was immediately sold by mainly the authors name, I have liked everything I read by her. Now the hard part is about picking a book by its cover is making sure its speculative enough to fit for bingo. This one turns out to be about a filming of a movie in Hollywood, and changes back and forth to the script of the movie. So, it would also fit for multi POV HM. I liked Vera’s character. She is the new face playing Salome the lead. Nancy is a struggling party girl trying to become an actress, mainly by sleeping with different men. It’s foreshadowed throughout the book that something will happen to Nancy. I didn’t enjoy the historical sections that much. Salome is described as a charming enchantress but its not shown her actions. She doesn’t seem to have much of personality other than that she’s pretty. I wasn’t sad when the character at the end died, I felt like he just existed to be killed at the end.

 

 

 

Set in A Small Town HM

Garden Spells – Sarah Addison Allen 2.5/5

Claire is stuck in her routine and loneliness, when her sister Sydney flees back to their small hometown with her daughter running from her abusive husband. The characters all seemed to be surface level only. The plot of Emma hating Sydney because she was her husband’s first love was petty/ Also it was stupid Emma’s only character trait is that she is good at sex. The whole plot was boy focuses. The fantasy element is that the family has a connection to magic, but I wish that was featured more. My favorite part was the magic tree in the backyard that tried to interfere.

.

Five short Stories HM

Toad Words and Other Stories- T Kingfisher 4/5

I love this author and was happy to realize I could make this fit for this square. This collection is fairy tale inspired. I like that in toad words she tried to repopulate endangered frogs with her ability to produce frogs and toads. In wood and woodsman, the woodsman is the villain, trying to kill grandma after she spurned him. Two stories point out how it is that the prince fell in love with Ariel, and that Pater Pan is basically a dictator. The addition of the talking boars to sleeping beauty was great. I enjoyed the collection and would recommend.

 

Eldritch Creatures HM

Shards of Earth – Adrian Tchaikovsky  4.5/5

I was trying to fit this into HM for multi POV, but it only had four POV. It fits a lot of other squares: space bingo, survival, character with disability, reference materials prologues, and first in a series. A motley crew of spacers are trying to stop the Architects, unknowable creatures who are destroying entire worlds. I thought it was interesting that the only way to communicate with the Architects was by experimenting on humans and killing most of the subjects in the process. It was a good balance of not too many space battles.  I really enjoyed this! I don’t always love when books switch POV so much, but I enjoyed all the characters perspectives. I will continue the series.

 

Reference Materials HM

Daggerspell -Katharine Kerr 2.5/5

This would also fit for the first in a series HM. This has a map and a glossary. I didn’t really like this one. Plot was mostly multiple men fight over a woman. The characters kept being reincarnated. Warning it features an incest plot. The woman Jill, never took control of her own destiny even though it seemed like she might as she trained to be a fighter. I won’t continue the series.

 

Book Club HM

The Wings Upon Her Back- Samantha Mills  4/5

Zemolai lost faith in the order she has been part of since a child. She worships the mechanical god, and in return the order gifts her a set of mechanical wings. She is kicked out the sect when she doesn’t report someone else’s transgression. I liked the flashbacks to her as a child. I’m guessing the mentor is basically grooming her. I found the description of the gods and the world interesting. I thought her turning to her captor’s side was realistic. The drug use made sense as well. When her brother died it was interesting that she committed to her sect harder, rather than questioning her way of life.

Zemolai’s wishy washiness got a little annoying. Pick a side! Also I was wondering why Zodaya committed so hard to brainwashing Zemolai. Surely, she has lots of recruits? That the body medication of the wings was difficult was a good plot point. I found that the past timeline with all the battle scenes became too action focused for me at the end. I liked the book but didn’t love it.",fantasy

Books which don't suffer from drag?,"Although not limited to the fantasy genre, it seems to be quite common for these books to suffer from drag. To be explicit, I'd personally define 'drag' as large chunks of the book where not a lot happens, or at least, a lot of content is included which has no implications on the main plot.

  
For reference, I had no or very little issues with drag in books like:

* ASOIAF 1-3
* The Kingkiller Chronicles 1-2
* The Gentlemen Bastards 1

Whereas I did struggle through books which meandered or felt at times bloated like:

* ASOIAF 4-5
* The Gentlemen Bastards 2-3
* The Way of Kings (Part 1)

This is not me saying these books are not good, it's me saying they can be a struggle for those who like forward momentum throughout. For example if you were to re-write the narrative of TWOK, you could chop out more than half the book and still prevent it from feeling rushed.

Are there good suggestions for fantasy books/series which keep good pace throughout?",fantasy

I started reading ""Master"" today and the time paradox with Thomas and they totally psychedelic and 80s vibe of Pug becoming a ""Great one"" along with Fiests totally ahead of his time imagination has officially gotten me hooked!

"Any mass market Urban Fantasy series with romance akin to Kate Daniels, Anita Blake, or Jane Yellow Rock? ","I love trashy mass market urban fantasy romance series, but I've had a long string of misses lately.

I gave the Hollow Series a try but didn't like that they gave the FMC a queer vampire roommate that she wasn't going to end up with (broke my little lesbian heart), Patricia Brigg's other series Alpha and Omega started in such a weird place it was hard to get into, and Ilona Andrews' The Edge Series is soooo cringey with the ""I own you woman!""

Recommendations for a good fantasy novel / series for a big Stephen King fan,"***(I know that King has written some fantasy and of course the dark tower but I'm interested in stuff from other authors that would scratch that same itch)***

So, I'm very interested in fantasy in general but I'm having a hard time to find something that really grips me like Stephen King novels do in general; i have read a bit of The Witcher books a while ago but don't remember much of it, I'm also almost done with the first book of the Mistborn series (Chapter 32) and it has honestly been quite difficult for me to get trough it. I expected an easier read but it felt so slow for so long, which i usually dont mind but this just didnt click for me, but hopefully that changes by the end of this the first book.

For example i picked up The Stand and read the entire thing very very fast, i couldn't put it down, same with 11/22/63, i wanted to get into fantasy so i went online to research and saw people saying that Brandon and specifically Mistborn was a great place to start, but yeah that just didn't work well for me.

I think i like a lot of character work? Not really sure what i like exactly, i just really like Stephen King, so i want some recommendations as someone that has read and loved a lot of his novels, what are some good fantasy novels / series that will scratch a similar itch ***written by another author.***

"Some Bingo Reviews of varying lenght: The Goblin Emperor, Solaris, Three Parts Dead and more","I want to get into the habit of writing at least short reviews for the books I read, maybe even going for a Hero card, so I'm getting started with some reviews of the Bingo books I've read sofar. Haven't decided yet on which will take which square, but I've listed all possible squares for the books.

# The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison

Bingo Squares: **Orcs, Trolls and Goblins, Oh My! (HM); Reference Materials (HM)**

I've discovered this book through recommendations on this sub, often together with The Hands of the Emperor by Victoria Goddard, as a comparison or when someone asked for something similar. As The Hands of the Emperor (HotE) is one of my favorite books I ha high hopes for this one, but have to say that, at least initially, I was disappointed. While I could see the similarities in the world building around the court and courtly society, the mood and especially the situation of the protagonist is extremely different.

Maia (the protagonist) suddenly becomes the Emperor after his fathers and all other heirs sudden death. As the unloved half goblin child of the elven Emperor, result of a political marriage, he was exiled from the courts and as his mother died when he was young, nobody bother to teach him much about the court and politics. So he starts off without knowledge or allies, theoretically powerful, but weak practically. This results in anxiety being the defining emotion for much of the first half of the book. While this is relatable, it's not what I enjoy reading about. But I have to give it to the author, Maias anxieties and worries were presented in a (to me) very convincing and believable manner. In contrast, HotE starts with the protagonist close to the peak of his (political) power and extremely capable, so the vibe is rather different early on.

The characters, in general were well fleshed out, not just the protagonist but also the side characters (at least the ones that got significant 'screen time', there are many minor characters in the story that aren't memorable and only appear once or twice). On the topic of characters I feel I've got to mention the names: as there are many characters that are often referred to by noble title, keeping track of who is who can be challenging, it mostly wasn't an issue for me, but I've seen many reviewers point it out, and I can see where they are coming from. The normal noble titles (Emperor aside) aren't used in this book, instead the author invented new ones, and combined them with the equivalents to Mr. and Mrs., which makes them less intuitive and harder to remember. I like me some conlang, so I didn't mind, but if you don't, this story might not be for you. There is a reason why the Dramatis Personae and the Guide to Elvish names are at the start of book, instead of in the addendum.

As the story progressed and the plot expanded beyond Maia reacting to suddenly being the emperor, slowly gaining agency and allies, my enjoyment grew, and as Maia became active in the politics I could see some more of the parallels to HotE.

Overall -- enjoyable, with the beginning a bit weaker. Strong depictions of characters and decent worldbuilding, although I would have liked to see more of world outside the court.

# Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots

Bingo squares: **Criminals (HM), Character with a disability (HM), First in a series** (?)(sequel is planned/ announced, but not out yet)

A take on a superheros and villains type of story from the perspective from of a Hench (as the title implies), and not a fighter but rather a data analyst, that gets roped into some field work. In the field she realises that most heros aren't exactly a force for good either. So the concepts pf ""don't meet your heros"" or ""who's really the villain"" definitely play a significant role in the story. The narration relies on the reader being already familiar with the genre, which is a fair assumption, especially when it subverts common tropes and plot lines of the genre. And the genre has been popular and visible enough that most people are familiar, at least in passing, with the general structure.

As the protagonist isn't a fighter herself, there are relatively few action scenes for the genre, but they are written well and are impactful and exciting, precisely because she isn't strong in a fight, and thus far more a risk, even on the sidelines. The best part of story was, for me at least, the characters and their relationships. I don't want to go into any details as that could spoil things, but in general I found the characters both interesting and believable. The narrator (I've listened to the audiobook) did a good job of voicing each character distinctly. Have to say that I still prefer reading myself to audiobooks, but I'll try a few more because I've got some credits left and am starting to lose interest in some of the podcasts I listen to.

# The Will of the Many by James Islington

Bingo Squares: Firsts in a series, Dark Academia, Book Club

This has been very popular on here, and I have to agree: it's very good. Not sure if I have anything to add. At first, I wasn't sure if a roman inspired setting would interest me, but it definitely works! Probably the most gripping story on my Bingo Board so far.

# Solaris by Stanislaw Lem

Bingo Squares: Eldritch Creatures (HM)

When picking up classic sci-fi I'm again and again surprised by the breadth of ideas that seem to emerged in a relatively short time when more became known about space. Solaris is a truly odd planet, and this story about and around it is correspondingly weird. Very psychological and rather introspective, surprisingly little about the mechanics of space flight for a story about exploring a different planet. We follow the protagonist arriving at the station surveying the planet Solaris from orbit and while he has to navigate the odd happenings on the station we also learn about humanities attempts to understand Solaris, a planet, completely covered by an ocean, that is also its sole inhabitant, as a single, massive superorganism, capable of controlling the planet, but unknown if sapient/intelligent.

Reading about such a different kind of 'ecosystem' and how it might function is something I very much enjoy, and one of the things that draws me to this subgenre of SF. I don't want to spoil the main mystery / conflict in the story, but suffice to say that it was almost as odd and interesting as the planet itself. Just for the general direction: I think this is the kind of narrative that takes the humans into outer space and confronts them with alien life, but is using the distance to reflect upon humanity.

While I've liked reading it, I've got to admit that it wasn't that memorable to me, read it a few months ago and had to think a while to recall any detail of the plot, have no clue of any of the names anymore.

As a side note: I've got this rather weird (this time not in a good way) collection of Lem works that I've got to rant about. It contains many or all of his novels and stories, but only short excerpts of all the novels. Super weird choice, only 20-40 pages per novel, neither the start nor the end, no context. Unsatisfying to read, little idea what the larger plot of anything is, no conclusion either. Thankfully my local library had a copy of Solaris, I initially bought this collection to read Solaris, not checking what \*exactly\* it contained. I'll probably only read the short stories that are printed in full in it and then get rid of it, maybe a used bookstore takes it. Its called Best of Lem, but imo its a terrible introduction to his work. Maybe for the curator these really are the best sections of the novels, but standing on their own they're just not very interesting to read. Anyway, back to bingo reviews!

# Un Lun Dun by China Mieville

Bingo Squares: Eldritch Creatures, Reference Materials (do illustrations count? I think there also was map, but can't check as I've returned my copy to the library)

Un Lun Dun tells a weird and fun adventure, set in the titular city, which lays beneath London. The city is as fun and weird as the story, or maybe it should be the other way around: the city is very odd, often in fun and magical ways, which shapes the story set in it. The worldbuilding is possibly my favorite part of the book - UnLunDun is chock full of peculiar people and creatures (and building and neighbourhoods. Many of these have trickled down from London to UnLunDun in some way or another, like the living broken umbrellas or the old double decker busses.

The story plays with the tropes of the chosen one and a prophesy foretelling their coming, subverting some of typical plot beats. The book is written as YA, or perhaps middle-grade, which makes these subversions work even better, as these tropes are more common in YA, so a subversion ""within"" the genre seems more interesting to me than it would be in, say, a more adult SFF book. These subversions of tropes and some other themes are spelled out rather strongly, I'm assuming this is because it's targeted to younger readers, who might be more likely to miss subtler messages. the plot is also rather straightforward, fitting the genre as well. Some of the elements reminded me of the structure of fairytales, in the way the protagonist gets some item of questionable utility, that later on fits perfectly to solve a challenge.

This was my first Mieville book, while some of his others are on my TBR, this one was on the shelve at the library, so I started here. I'm guessing that, as a YA book, it isn't exactly representative of his other adult focussed work, but as I liked it, I'm taking it as a positive sign and will certainly be reading some of his other books at some point.

# Three Parts Dead by Max Gladstone

Bingo squares: Eldritch Creatures (HM), Multi POV (HM), First in Series (HM), Book Club, Prologues and Epilogues

Magical lawyers and necromancer investigating a gods death, trying to save or at least his church. The magic system in this was very cool, sort of straddling the fence between hard and soft. Magic can be written down in contracts, binding it, and magic energy is quantified and traded with, two quite hard characteristics. But when freeforming magic outside of contracts there seem to be many possibilities for what is possible, and while there probably are limits (definitely on sheer power), the abilities of magic appear wide ranging and with little constraints on what can be affected, especially when gods are involved. Part of that probably is that the main characters we accompany are very skilled and capable. The protagonist, Tara, has just graduated at the start of the book, not quite finished her studies and thus definitely isn't at her peak, but already quite skilled, and the more senior mages far more so.

The authors managed to make me detest the antagonist, great character work on that one, A+. The ""good guys"" were also well written, but far more likable, of course. The team comes together over the course of the story, each with their own difficulties and some conflict between them. While this is, to some extent, the group of unlikely heroes coming together under adverse circumstance, the way it way executed is different enough it didn't immediately remind me of the trope, which is a good thing, as I'm a bit tired of it. The main POVs are Tara and Abelard, a priest of the dead god Kos, whos death they are investigating and trying to reverse. While there are more POVs (the book qualifies for hard mode on the Multi POV square), the others are for a few scenes here and there, not constant, which keeps the story focussed on the most important parts.

The plot has a mix of different elements: Tara and her mentor are hired as lawyers, but have to work like investigators, but there are also political machinations involved, and every now and then they have to fight as well.

The book has intrigued me and I want to see where the characters and the world are going, so I'll be continuing this series, although I haven't been good in keeping up with series recently, so who knows when I get around to that.

# The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie

Bingo Squares: Eldritch Creatures (HM), Under the Surface, Entitled Animals, Set in a small town

This book seemed shorted to me than it is, it read very quick. I read it in less than a day, and as an ebook, could barely believe that it's over 400 pages. That definitely speaks for the writing style, it has good flow and is engrossing.

The Raven Tower has a fresh take on Gods being heavily involved and integrated into a world: there are many gods in this world, who inhabit various objects or animals. They are far from all-powerful, though they can will anything to happen or be, they are limited by their energy, which they gain from believers. The civilisation in this world isn't very advanced, it seemed more like a bronze age equivalent than the typical medieval setting, so most settlements are rather small, with corresponding small and local gods, who are heavily involved in the lives of their few believers, often assisting them against other groups. This created a combination of well justified believe and worship, as a god could interfere visibly, and also rather business like approach to dealings with gods, as it is, for both parties, a kind of trade: energy from worship for miracles. I like reading about this kind of worldbuilding, seeing how a culture forms around a change.

A central part of the plot is a mystery - what happend and is going on in the titular tower, most importantly where its ruler is. There is also a second storyline of flashbacks from the narrator, which tells of the history of the land. Part of the mystery is how the second storyline ties in, so I wont tell more about it.

While the style of the narration is a bit on the slow side, the overall plot moves along rather quickly, especially considering the two storylines being told in tandem.

In my opinion the weakest point in the book are the characters. They can be convincing, but most didn't seem that fleshed out. I can't say I cared much for any of them, aside from the narrator and perhaps the protagonist, and forgot the names almost immediately (I'm bad at names though). As the narrator is a god (did I mention that?), they don't care much for most humans, and I think that shines through in the narration, so this weakness could be seen as intentional, or part of the larger design of the book.

# Die Insel der tausend Leuchttürme (The Island of a thousand lighthouses) by Walter Moers

Bingo Squares: Eldritch Creatures (HM); Set in a small town (technically HM, but not really); Under the Surface; Orc, Trolls, &amp; Goblins (Gnomes, but I'm counting them as part of the group); Reference Materials)

This is a German Fantasy book, so probably not relevant for most people on this sub, but I wanted to review it here anyway. I'm not sure if it has been translated yet, but I know at least some of the earlier ones from the Zamonien series have been, which I definitely recommend if you like weird and funny fantasy. On that note: has someone read the English translations? I'd like to know how well they hold up, as the author likes to invent words, which I imagine are hard to translate.

Walter Moers is one of those fantasy authors that is ""only a translator"", translating the books from another world. In this case the in-world author of the book is also the translator is also the protagonist, Hildegunst von Mythenmetz (his last name translates roughly to Mythmason), who travels to the island of Eydernorn, also known as the titular Island of a thousand lighthouses, for health reasons, to the famous health resort on the island. He is a hypochondriac, but gets treated anyway because the doctor is a fan of his books. The author likes his wordplay, an example is the name of the island, Eydernorn, an anagram of the actual German island Norderney. The setting in general is definitely inspired by the German North Sea coast and islands (Friesland/Frisia).

As you might already guess from this snippet, it isn't a very serious book, but rather funny and sometimes silly. The most important part of this is the world building, the descriptions of the island and its inhabitants. The larger setting of the series, Zamonien, is a weird place, and Eydernorn fits right in. There are lots of weird and sometimes wacky local flora and fauna, local customs, people, and buildings. This truly its strongest suit. The type of worldbuilding could be compared to UnLunDun, though the overall tone is more humours and absurd. Pratchett could be another point of comparison, though Moers spends far more time on worldbuilding and exploration. I'm not sure how to convey the breadth and detail of the inventions and descriptions of the island, I don't think there is a single mundane animal, all have at least some fantastical twist to them, and none are classic fantasy staples. Especially odd and inventive are the lighthouses, almost none of them work like typical, instead using things like fireworks, lava, or swarms of bioluminescent insects as their light source. The lighthouse keepers are oddballs as well, of course, each of them an at least slightly mad genius, creating objects like hallucinogenic maps that give the readers visions of the place they depict, or creating rocket fuel from seagull poop. All of this is relevant to plot, I swear.

Now to the plot. This isn't the first book with Hildegunst as the protagonist, and while he isn't exactly heroic or a hero, this book plays with putting him in the role of the foretold hero who is unexplainably skilled at various relevant tasks (very out of character for him). I'm saying plays with because I couldn't take it entirely seriously, and I think it wasn't supposed to be. But it is still somewhat odd to read, as it is played mostly straight. The plot is a bit weak in my opinion. For a significant part in the beginning of the novel Hildegunst arrives and we explore the island together with him, with some hints of the larger mystery, but little happening in terms of plot development. While the plot starts to pick up slowly, there is point at about the last quarter where the author must have thought to start concluding things, as the pace picks up a lot and a whole buch of action happens until everything is wrapped up in an ending I found a bit unsatisfying. In that final run up to the end it seem to me that quite a few of the side characters were mostly there as tools for the plot and not very fleshed out; I've certainly read worse cases of this, but I know the author can do better.

Two final notes on the writing style: The book is written as an epistolary novel, the protagonist (and ""author"") writing to his friend about his travels, but without any return letters from the friend, because the post ship (and all other ships) is stuck with repairs in the harbor after a storm. And in his letters Hildegunst often draws what he writes about, so this book is filled with illustrations. These are all done by the author, who started as a comic artist and illustrates all his books himself.

While I was a bit disappointed by the plot this was still a very enjoyable book. The writing style, worldbuilding and the protagonist are simply good enough that they carry the weaker parts.

If I've interested you with this review I'd recommend checking out either the first Zamonien book, The 13 1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebear or the first book with Hildegunst as the protagonist, The City of Dreaming Books.",fantasy
Book recs for elements of The Empyrean series by Rebecca Yarro OTHER THAN the romance aspect ,"Tagged for spoilers just in case since I’ll be describing the aspects I’m looking for. I recently got into the fourth wing audiobooks (Rebecca Soler is so talented!) and am almost done with the second one! Looking for similar books though has felt impossible since every list I find is focusing on the romance parts of the books. I don’t mind romance but have never loved when it’s a bigger portion of the story than other plot points.  

I love the world building and how we’re introduced to information in ways that doesn’t feel too exposition heavy. The whole cast of characters felt very rich and plot relevant. The world felt very lived in and immersive to me as a result. The way information is hidden to us was also super enjoyable because I don’t often feel like plot twists change my feelings retroactively on characters or scenes but this book series got me a few times and made me look back and notice details, decisions, and behaviors in a new light!

I also really like the main character’s growth and how the author takes a lot of tropes of fantasy and does something new with a lot of them (her getting 2 dragons). She also plays a few of them straight (like violet’s powers being treated as incredibly destructive by her, or how she’s kind of garbage at using them and her being powerful doesn’t change that she needs to get more skilled).

Any suggestions? Again, I love romance as much as the next person but I feel like every recommendation I find is about similar romances and doesn’t focus on the political/mystery/world building aspect.

The Shadow Of The Torturer was a strange experience ,"Perhaps the most stellar written book I’ve ever read purely on the technical discipline at which the prose is constructed: From how the sentences rhyme down to word choices.

Intentionally or no, I’m unable to see... tbh I’m unable to try see the bigger picture at this point. As is, this is one giant throve of a mystery book to me and all in all I’ll rate it 4 stars purely off how immersive it was due to how vivid a picture the prose painted from the first sentence down to the last.

Stephen Deas: Dominion Series,"First I read the ThiefTakers series, and having enjoyed it (a wee wt! at the end of it) I tried this next.

Loved the first  - The Moonsteel Crown. 

“The Emperor of Aria has been murdered, the Empire is in crisis, and Dead Men walk the streets…

But Myla, Fings, and Seth couldn’t care less. They’re too busy just trying to survive in the Sulk-struck city of Varr, committing petty violence and pettier crimes to earn their keep in the Unrulys, a motley gang led by Blackhand.

When the Unrulys are commissioned to steal a mysterious item to order, by an equally mysterious patron, the trio are thrust right into the bitter heart of a struggle for the Crown, where every faction is after what they have.

Forced to lie low in a city on lockdown, they will have to work together if they want to save their skins… and maybe just save the Empire as well.”

Fings...as in Fingers. A very good thief, if unable to resist - ever.

Myla a failed Sword Priest

Seth, a, well Seths role changes, he was a novice monk and was evictd because? Ah that's part of the tale.

we will be again following the picturesque group of Myla, Fings, and Seth, but this time in Deephaven, instead of Varr, where things are starting to become more complicated.

Myla has returned to Deephaven, with the company of Orien, in order to set right the things with her past

Seth has continued through the dark path he started in Book 1, using it for his own benefit, despite we can see some small remains of the old Seth.

And Fings, well, he's still the pickpocketer and chaotic person we knew previously. But in this second novel, we will take a deeper look at him, as he will be able to find what happened to the brother he thought disappeared five years ago.

  
Compelling someone said. Yes, I eagerly awaited the next bit, will Myla, what about her new companion, the Fire Mage Orien? 

And Seth, what is he doing now?! It has humour, rather like Abercrombies in a way. Dark humour. 

I'll leave off the descriptions now but I was pleasantly surprised. This has average ratings on Goodreads, but I rate it much higher. 

The last book is Herald Of The Black Moon, which I am about to read.

I've read fantasy books for children when I was a kid, but I want to start reading fantasy again! I am 16, so I'd appreciate it if the book is YA. English isn't my first language, so I think a book where the language isn't too difficult would be the best.  I have read Cinderella is Dead and Wilder Girls and I liked those, not sure if it counts as fantasy though.

Some of the series I've read so far in no particular order: Wheel of Time, The Bound and the Broken, King Killer Chronicle, Riyria Revelaions, The Belgariad, Malloreon, Bond of a Dragon, Mistborn, Stormlight Archive, Sword of Truth, Wrath of the Stormking, Mageborn, Art of the Adept, Songs of Chaos, King's Dark Tidings, Eragon, Harry Potter, Codex Alera, Lightbringer, Black Magician Trilogy, The Licianus Trilogy, The Riftwar Saga, Obsidian Trilogy, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, The First Law Trilogy, Game of Thrones, Farseer Trilogy, Raven's Shadow.

Out of those books the absolute favorites were: King Killer Chronicle, Wheel of Time, The Bound and the Broken, Codex Alera and the Lightbringer series.

I typically prefer the typical sword and sorcery high fantasy with classic troupes like the chosen one farmboy etc. But I'm up to something different as well. Not a huge fan of Sanderson, I liked the Kaladin parts in the Stormlight Archive a lot but not really a huge fan of how limited his magic systems are.

"Fantasy recommendations for female author, FMC, romance SUBPLOT (only for spice)","Hey all! I have a highly specific book itch to scratch and I'm hoping someone has some recs that fit what I'm looking for. I want to start off by saying please please please, no Sarah J Mass. 

With that out of the way, I'm looking for fantasy with a strong FMC, written by a female author. I'm not looking for romantasy, but I enjoy it when there's like, one or two spicy scenes somewhere in the book. Books I've read that fit this have been the One Dark Window/Two Twisted Crowns duoloy by Rachel Gilling, and Uprooted by Naomi Novick.

"Fantasy book series suggestions with classic hero themes. (Self discipline, sticking to morals against adversity, self-sacrifice)","
What happened to an appreciation for classic story themes? Please suggest a fantasy series that explore doing the right thing and self-sacrifice, please. 
I’ve noticed that books these days often don’t have stakes, or have protagonists that aren’t willing to put themselves on the line and pay the price to do the right thing. There’s always some excuse they give for making some kind of shady deal or compromise to avoid getting hurt. It’s all about self preservation and me, me, me first. I’m looking for fantasy series (medieval, urban, whatever, as long as there is some fantastical element, no matter how minor) where the protagonist (male heavily preferred) is willing to sacrifice life and limb for others or the greater good, and has close brushes with death as a result. I’m not saying I’m going for something totally grimdark. I just want something a little more classically heroic, with all the accompanying heroic sacrifices themes and their implications explored a little more realistically. One where the protagonist steps up and have to suffer consequences, some time to heal, pain that lasts more than a day or isn’t instantly healed, some trauma they have to work through (hopefully, without a full ‘fall from grace’ with the hero becoming a raging jerk or alcoholic that seems to be the stock standard trope for the annoyingly depressing ones).
Honestly, I’m just craving an appropriately dramatic heroic sacrifice scene, with all buildup and heart wrenching tension of his friends and families anguished ‘Did he just die? Omg, he’s dead’, crying over him, trying to revive him, and then the cathartic release of ‘He’s still with us!’

P.S. I’m okay with pov switches to give context or explore secondary characters, but prefer books that focus predominantly on one or at most two main character’s perspectives or journeys. I quickly lose interest if there are half a dozen main characters that keep switching povs so often that I can’t become personally attached enough to feel invested in any of them.",fantasy

I love this battle scene in A Dance with Dragons,"As you know, there aren't many battle scenes in ASOIAF compared to some other fantasy novels. The more popular ones among them are the Red Wedding, the Battle of the Blackwater, the Battle beneath the Wall, etc. However, for some reason, I was more excited by this brief battle scene between the ironborn and the northmen and thought it was quite underrated. Maybe I was drawn in by Martin's simple yet elegant writing style in describing this scene. I have also greatly enjoyed reading about Asha Greyjoy. What a character!

&gt;*They lit no torches either*, Asha had time enough to think, *and they know these woods better than we ever could*. Then the trees erupted all around them, and the northmen poured in howling. *Wolves*, she thought, *they howl like bloody wolves. The war cry of the north*. Her ironborn screamed back at them, and the fight began.

&gt;No singer would ever make a song about that battle. No maester would ever write down an account for one of the Reader’s beloved books. No banners flew, no warhorns moaned, no great lord called his men about  him to hear his final ringing words. They fought in the predawn gloom, shadow against shadow, stumbling over roots and rocks, with mud and rotting leaves beneath their feet. The ironborn were clad in mail and salt-stained leather, the northmen in furs and hides and piney branches. The moon and stars looked down upon their struggle, their pale light filtered through the tangle of bare limbs that twisted overhead.",fantasy

"Raymond Feist's ""Magician"" - Original novel or the 1992 director's cut","UPDATE:  Thanks, everyone.  Really appreciate the input.  The ""no bloat"" comment was especially the kind of input I was looking for.  I'll be purchasing the director's cut.

I read the original Riftwar trilogy way back in the day.  Lately, I've been thinking I might like to revisit some of the sci-fi/fantasy novels of my youth.  I come to find out that Feist put out a 10th anniversary reissue of Magician in 1992, in which he does some rewrites and adds some material... basically, a director's cut.

Has anyone here read both versions?  I'm kind of torn on which version to purchase.  Part of me wants to get the expanded edition, but since this is mostly a nostalgic exercise, another part of me is gravitating toward the original version.  It's also possible that the changes represented in the later version don't make a substantial difference from the original, and it doesn't matter which version I choose to read.

If someone has read both versions and has an opinion to offer, I'd sure like to hear it.

Looking for a good fantasy book!,"The main two things I really like are stories featuring dragons (preferably as one of the prominent characters) and magic. I also really like dwarfs and would prefer a school/academy setting, although none of my mentioned preferences are mandatory by any means. As long as the story itself is good, has in-depth characters and good world building I don't really mind if it's elf, dwarf, school or hospital. I also have aphantasia, meaning I can't picture anything in my mind, therefore I'd really appreciate books that don't obsess *too* much about descriptions and focus more on the plot. 

The two fantasy titles I've enjoyed most so far are Eragon by Christopher Paolini and Mother of Learning by Domagoj Kurmaic. They both excel in world building, have interesting characters and a good story. 

I haven't read a lot so far, so feel free to also suggest popular titles! Bonus points if the story has an unusual aspect to it, like MoL did with the time loop thing, but I also appreciate classic adventures like in Eragon. I also like long books and in general my rule of thumb is the longer the better, although it obviously shouldn't feel forced by the author and impact the story.

"[Review] Jam Reads: Ghost Apparent, by Jelena Dunato","https://preview.redd.it/4q6w13b0terd1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1664a9c23152af853f5d8c8a50d4217ee714bd43

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/ghost-apparent-by-jelena-dunato)

*Ghost Apparent* is a dark fantasy novella, written by Jelena Dunato, and published by *Ghost Orchid Press*. A story about the rise of a young woman to the power of the city of Abia, a complex and intricate political fantasy that further develops the folklore of Dunato's world (which is shared with *Dark Woods, Deep Water*) in a marvelous setting inspired by Adriatic history.

After her father, the gospodar of Abia, is assassinated in a coup organized by her uncle, Orsiana finds herself powerless in the streets of Abia. Desperate for help to stop the ongoing scheming, she pleads for help with the only power still available, becoming a pawn for gods' game; but even with the gifts given by them, she will have to fight against everything, especially those she appreciates, if she wants to keep the city she learned to love.

In only 100 pages, Dunato weaves a mesmerising story centered around Orsiana and her growth as character, how the force of circumstances acts as the engine for her change; going from the streets of Abia to the realm of gods, having to bargain with powers bigger than her, when a few hours ago she was just the daughter of the gospodar. At the end, in the center of her heart, Abia is what matters, putting the city over her own interests. 

Not only the central arc is compelling, but the worldbuilding deserves a mention. Dunato's prose borders the lyrical, being abundant in descriptions, creating strong imagery. While we already knew Morana, goddess of death from her previous book, the pantheon gets expanded, including more gods and their twisted ways to interact with humans.

*Ghost Apparent* is an excellent dark fantasy novella, great to be read in one sit, and that encloses a powerful feminist story. I totally recommend this one if you like political fantasy, or if you are a fan of Slavic folklore, as you won't be disappointed. At this point, I can say that I will read anything written by Jelena Dunato, who has proven again her talent as author.",fantasy

Books that you can’t stop thinking about?,"What fantasy book/series has lingered in your mind weeks, months, even years after you read it?",fantasy
What is your opinion on fantasy worlds based on ancient Greece?,"Every few months or so, someone makes a post here asking about fantasy books in a world based on ancient Greece. The same books get recommended each time: Gene Wolf’s *Soldier of the Mist* trilogy, David Gemmell’s *Troy* trilogy, or Madeleine Miller’s several reworkings of ancient Greek mythology, to mention a few. Most of which, to me, appear to be mythological retellings, not works set in a wholly new secondary world based on the history and society of ancient Greece. Sometimes books that are not even faux-ancient Greece get mentioned, such as Guy Gavriel Kay’s *Sarantine Mosaic* duology, which is distinctly Eastern Roman/Byzantine, I assume on account of them being vaguely ‘ancient’. While I have not read it, Megan Whelan Turner’s *Queen’s Thief* series seems an honourable exception, although one user [described](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hsa4vh/comment/fyahecu/) it as a “Medieval setting with great characterization and 20% greek-themed seasoning”.

I love ancient Greece. I have a Master’s in Ancient History, I write essays and book reviews on ancient topics on my blog, and I am a flaired user on r/AskHistorians answering questions on ancient Greece. I also love fantasy, even if I don’t get around to reading it much recently. I find it fascinating that, despite at least some interest, there are not more books with a faux-ancient Greece setting, especially when compared to the seeming ubiquity of faux-Medieval settings. I am really interested in what you all imagine when you hear (or read, in this case) the words ‘ancient Greece’, regardless of how much you know about the period – think of it as a study in the reception of the ancient world!

I think it is important to define what I mean when I write ancient Greece, because, in my experience, it can mean dramatically different things for different people. For me, ancient Greece spans 1000–30 BC, the Geometric/Early Iron Age, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. Prior to this is the Late Bronze Age – the inspiration for the setting of Miles Cameron’s *Age of Bronze* – a period with dramatic differences to the later periods. Of course, Early Iron Age, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greece, all also have their differences – especially Hellenistic Greece, which is dramatically different from preceding periods of Greek history – but there is also a great amount of continuity between them.

I have a few ideas of my own about what is most emblematic about ancient Greece:

**Greek and Greek-sounding names**  
This seems like an obvious one, but using names that are based on those from ancient Greece, or even lifting names directly from the historical record, if not the most well-known ones, is a clear way to make a setting feel reminiscent of ancient Greece. You could go even further and use the Hellenising English versions of names, using ‘k’ instead of ‘c’ or ‘-os’ instead of ‘-us’. So, for example, Aklaios instead of Alcaeus.

**City states**  
This is another obvious one, but city states are ubiquitous with ancient Greece. The *polis* – a core urban centre with a hinterland – was the foundation of Greek society. There were over 1000 such *poleis* throughout the ancient Greek world, and they could be anything from a vast city like Athens to a small town. The government of these *poleis* also came in a variety of flavours, from monarchy or tyranny to oligarchy and democracy. They could be organised into leagues, such as, famously, the Peloponnesian League, or even empires, such as the Athenian Empire, but they were still *poleis*.

**Religion and mythology**  
This is a large, multifaceted element of ancient Greece. Religious practices were incredibly diverse. Similarly, the mythological tales that have come down to us are but a snapshot of the plethora of oral tales that were likely told. However, there were constants, such the core pantheon of Greek gods. There were hundreds, if not thousands of gods in ancient Greece, many of them existed in various guises with different epithets, but Zeus, Hera, Athena, and all the familiar names were known. Many *poleis*, for example, had a temple to Athena Polias, Athena as protector of cities. Prayers and sacrifices were regularly offered to the gods, some more than others, and were a part of all people’s lives. Prayers and sacrifices would be held before court sessions, before battle, and even, if you were of the superstitious type, at every single bad sign or omen, for example.

Similarly, most people would have known stories about the most prominent heroes of Greek mythology, such as Odysseus. Others would have had a more local significance, such as Theseus in Athens. Some even received prayers and sacrifices themselves, such as Amphiaraos at the Amphiareion at Oropos, which functioned as both a healing sanctuary and an oracle. People could even claim descent from these heroes, and even from the gods, such as the Aineiadai in Anatolia, who claimed descent from Aineias, the prince of Troy, and thus from Aphrodite. Similarly, tradition maintained that Plato was one of the Neleidai, a descendent of Neleus, king of Pylos and, in one version, son of Poseidon.

**Philosophers**  
One thing ancient Greece is known for today is its philosophy. Athens is particularly well known for its philosophers and schools – Socrates and Plato are household names. However, many *poleis* could boast of having philosophers, such as the Ionian cities on the coast of Asia Minor, and philosophical debates were likely a pastime of elite Greeks.

**Homosexuality**  
This is another thing the Greeks are well known for – and has caused significant controversy over the years. Homosexuality in ancient Greece, however, was largely based upon pederasty, or love between an older man and a youth. The ages of those involved in these relationships varied, from what would be illegal today to a questionable age gap, but it is still not a practice that should be encouraged. That said, homosexuality more generally is also associated with the Greeks. Male prostitution was common in ancient Athens, for example, and Greek myths were full of stories about same-sex (almost exclusively male) partners.

**Festivals and competitions**  
One of ancient Greece’s lasting influences on the modern world is the Olympics. Every four years athletes from throughout the Greek world – hence its status as a Panhellenic Game – would gather at Olympia in the Peloponnese to compete in athletic competitions. The Olympics were only the most prestigious of athletic competitions. There were three other Panhellenic games – the Pythian Games at Delphi, the Nemean Games at Nemea, and the Isthmian Games near Corinth – and there were also hundreds of local athletic games every year. What’s more, marriages could also serve as venues for athletic games, although much more localised than *polis* or Panhellenic Games.

Ancient Greek theatre was also a competition. Much like athletic games, theatrical competitions were also religious events, at least, they began as such. They were also, like athletic competitions, venues for politics. Prominent and wealthy members of communities would be responsible for financing different theatrical groups, and politicians could be the subject of scathing (and, as is often the case with Aristophanes, scatalogical) satire.

**Hoplites**  
This is a relatively minor point in terms of an overall world, but hoplites are distinctly ancient Greek in the popular imagination. While for the Greeks a hoplite was simply a heavy infantryman, with Xenophon using the term to describe Egyptian infantry, for example, and Herodotus telling us that the Phoenicians used the same arms and armour as the Greeks, most people will likely imagine a man wearing either a bronze cuirass or linothorax, wielding a spear and *aspis*, with a Corinthian helmet on his head.



These are only a few of the most prominent elements of ancient Greek history and society that I feel are emblematic of the period and, therefore, might make a fantasy world feel reminiscent of ancient Greece. However, this is not an exhaustive list, nor are many of the items unique to a faux-ancient Greece setting. City states, philosophers, homosexuality, and festivals and competitions could easily be applied to a faux-Renaissance Italy setting, for example. In 1991, there was even an academic book published containing essays on different aspects of city states in the ancient world and Medieval Italy. Perhaps Greek-style names are most important to distinguish these elements from other historically-inspired settings that share them.

What do you think? What comes to mind when you imagine ancient Greece? What would tell you a fantasy setting was inspired by ancient Greece?

SPOILERS Green Bone Saga full series discussion/rambling,"I just finished the Green Bone Saga, reading it after extreme praise all over this sub. I'll say that I pounded through the books quickly, and mostly enjoyed them. But I definitely had some issues. I'd like to put down some thoughts/ramblings and see what everyone else thinks.

The setting was fantastic. Some obvious parallels to the real world once you understand things, but done uniquely and always made interesting.

The tension was also great. Nobody ever felt truly safe.

I loved Hilo. He obviously has flaws, and the stuff with Niko's mom made me hate him for a bit. But he was just all in for his family, and nearly always did what was right. Even supported the jadless and Anden despite most being against them. I hate that he died, and would have loved for at least ONE person to get a nice ending with an old life in the series. I find it shocking that the penitents are apparently not checked in any way. Show up in the robes alone and nobody checks your ID or pats you down? Stupid. No way that was the first time somebody non-religious tried something like that.

Ayt Mada's exile. I HATED this decision. I understand the ""poetic"" move this was meant to be. Making her fade while her enemies took her place. But it just doesn't make sense to me. They said she still has loyalists, and they formed a splinter clan somewhere in Kekon. If she's exiled...wouldn't they just find her, give her jade, and she'd go right back to scheming? Leaving her alive seems like a huge mistake, and with somebody like her I just see absolutely no chance she would stay exiled instead of finding another way to the top.

On the same but opposite vein, I liked Bero managing to somehow survive. His ending actually felt poetic. Especially the rebuff by Niko and his final meeting with Anden.

Jaya felt criminally underused. They talked a lot about the challenges of being a woman Green Bone, but they barely ever talked about Jaya. I feel like she should have gotten a little more time. They could have shown the younger side of being a woman Green Bone, and the challenges she faced.

Shae. I am super conflicted about her. Like Anden in the first book, she annoyed the hell out of me. But unlike Anden, she really grew on me after Lan's death when she stepped up. But she just seemed to make terrible decisions constantly, which had me going up and down on my opinion of her.

-Leading Woon on for YEARS until finally seducing him after he's married. Asshole move.

-Losing the clean blade and never getting more jade. They made it super clear how powerful Perception was throughout the series. Why would she not want more of it to do her job better?

-Letting Ayt Mada live. An idiotic decision that barely makes sense. I know she thought Hilo was dead too, but it still makes no sense. If she lived and Hilo died, Shae would have been dead in a week and No Peak destroyed, the rest of her family killed too.

-Her and Wen go to Shotar with just 2 bodyguards while openly trying to beat out entrenched Crews supported by the Mountain. Them being attacked was obvious. But she stupidly goes there with no protection, orders the bodyguards to ignore their instincts which gets them all fucked, and eventually costs them millions by pulling out of the country just to save her.

Ysabel is in the top half of Guy Gavriel Kay works I have read,"Ysabel is usually listed as GGK's worst work, but I enjoyed myself a lot while reading, and I would place it in the top half if I were to rank the stories of his I read. For context, the only GGK works I have not read are Children of Earth and Sky, A Brightness Long Ago, and All the Seas of the World. Everything else, I have read.

Ysabel is a more intimate and personal story compared to other GGK stories. It is smaller in scope and focuses primarily on the growth and development of a single character, Ned. I enjoyed the smaller, intimate tale a lot. Sometimes stories don't need large stakes or a sweeping narrative to still have an impact. And watching Ned grow into his own is satisfying in its own right. 

GGK's distinct voice is still present, but it comes with a modern slant. The modern dynamics explored through GGK's lens is brilliant, and I love the ideas he sprinkled throughout that he otherwise couldn't in his stories that do not take place in a modern setting (ie basically the rest of them. Fionavar is debatable). 

This is just a short and sweet love letter to Ned, and given how Ysabel is talked about, I think it is certainly very underrated. I enjoy my time with this a lot, and I lived the fresh perspective GGK offered here. 

Finally, I didn't know I needed a SpongeBob reference in GGK's style, but I need more.",fantasy

Litrpg review: Demon Card Enforcer,"Someone posted recently on some favorites in the fantasy subgenre litrpg/gamelit. I wanted to share my new favorite card game litrpg along those lines,

Demon Card Enforcer, by John Stovall. tl;dr: It’s a fast-paced noir action thriller with memorable characters, and a fantastic set of card game mechanics.

Wolfe isn’t a bad man, he just owes a bad man a really big debt. Working as an enforcer for Big Man Grimm, head of a notorious crime family, hasn’t been easy. Especially when he has no magic in a world where a lucky few have been divinely gifted with magical decks of cards that allow them to summon magical creatures and give themselves powerful abilities for fighting alongside them. When Wolfe receives a deck, he’s not surprised to see that many of the cards are Infernal—reflecting the hard choices he’s had to make in this life—but others are Beast cards, specifically dog-themed ones that remind him of his loyal, late dog Pierce. The best one of all is Cereboo, a three-headed, powerful dog companion card in a brand new set that only grows stronger the more set cards Wolfe collects. But collecting the cards might mean killing other powerful cardbearers. So maybe it’s not such a bad thing that the Grimm crime family is about to go to war…

If you like gritty, noir-style stories, or main characters that have to make hard choices to survive, you should check this out. If you love deckbuilding strategy or card game mechanics of games like Magic the Gathering, you’ll love it. If you’ve read other John Stovall books, you know how seriously he takes his systems.",fantasy
Review - Mushroom Blues by Adrian M. Gibson - Cyberpunk with a chance of fungus,"https://preview.redd.it/89c1pjoykcrd1.jpg?width=984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=925e6b7a6dcc1ccdc0064c4ee00114828dfb3d0b

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-mushroom-blues-by-adrian-m-gibson-3/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-mushroom-blues-by-adrian-m-gibson-3/)

Cyberpunk is a genre that is a bit like grimdark in that it is a very popular one but also one that no one has any real luck defining. As much as “High Tech, Low Life” is busted out, what that actually means is a matter of opinion. For me, I tend to suggest cyberpunk is science fiction noir. It’s when the quality of life has not been improved by technology but the problems remain because of human nature. While not all cyberpunk has to be cops and robbers in a corrupt system, it certainly helps when they are. Neuromancer, Takashi Kovacs, the Buyadeen books, Blade Runner, and both the Cyberpunk 2022/2077 and Shadow Run world all depend on this. Which as close to an all-inclusive list as you’re going to get. Even Robocop, Akira, and Ghost in the Shell are adjacent here.

MUSHROOM BLUES falls under this definition even if we could probably be cute an call it “Fungalpunk.” In this case, it’s science fiction with the premise being humanity has conquered a world that has (probably) human-descended colonists that have merged with the local cordyceps to form their own culture. Note: This isn’t a spoiler or even brought up in the book as a possibility but I feel there’s a lot of clues to this effect. If this doesn’t sound like a cyberpunk tale, take note that it’s actually about the brutality of racism, colonialism, capitalism, organized crime, and how absolutely none of this can be affected by our protagonists.

The absolute simplest way of describing the story is a fantastic prejudice allegory ala WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT or the X-men. It takes place on an alien planet but humans are in charge because they won the war and the local mushroom people are under their thumb. The humans hate it on the island nation of Hoppon and its capital of Neo Konoko. Fungus is, understandably everywhere, and the locals hate them. The humans treat the locals like crap and the fungals hate them right back. Henrietta Hofmann is assigned to work with fungal police officer Koji Nameko and the two of them get along like oil and water. It’s a fairly classic IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT scenario, only with more black mold.

Henrietta Hofmann is a casually racist and particularly nasty protagonist that is assigned to NKPD because she’s burned all bridges with her alcoholism as well as involvement in an incident that may have gotten her daughter killed. The actual specifics are a secret until the end of the book but paint her in the worst light possible. She hates fungals and hates being where she is. Like most racists, though, she has limits and doesn’t think she’s a racist. Awful cop that she is who hurls casual slurs, she is genuinely horrified at fungal children being murdered and wants to solve the crime.

Koji Nameko is an Asian coded police officer who is considered to be a traitor to his people by the occupied fungals. However, the police force is as racist to him and hateful as anyone else. The police chief insists that everyone is equal but he’s being very clear that this is only to keep the overt racism in line since everyone, including Koji, knows that the humans are an occupying force. He states his job is to try to help his people by working from the inside but it’s questionable how much he can do (if anything).

Much of the book is dedicated to Henrietta learning not to be viciously racist and viscerally disgusted by the fungals. These are the least pleasant parts of the books and there were many times that I didn’t care about Henrietta’s journey of self-discovery. Instead, I was more interested in the developing resistance and lives of the fungals. The combination of realistic oppression with sci-fi concepts like fungal minds is very interesting and I’m totally on their side.

In conclusion, this is a solid and entertaining novel. I really enjoyed the characters, the world-building, and the real-life allusions. The plot is excellently structured with several unexpected twists along the way. While I wasn’t a fan of Henrietta, I have to say that I’m still going to pick up the sequel. Cyberpunk is rarely treated with the seriousness and darkness it requires to really hit home as satire but this succeeds.",fantasy

The Fionavar Trilogy,"This is my first ever post in Reddit. 

I want to ask if anyone shares opinion on FT regarding inclusion of the Arthurian myth. I am a big fan of anything Arthurian. But in this case it seemed like a really sticking out tapestry piece. For me it would have been better if there was a character who we identify as Arthurian hero, but not exactly being him. It unnecessarily complicated the plot, made it heavier and a bit corny. But the same dynamic without actually naming the characters from the Arthurian lore would make it more sophisticated. What do you think? Best, Godzilla ",fantasy
Fantasy recommendations with lovable character dynamics like Cradle?,"I'm fairly new to fantasy and recently devoured the Cradle series, spending a whole month on it (I'm a bit of a slow reader). Besides it I've only read Mistborn, which I really liked as well.  
  
When I search for similar books to Cradle, people often suggest other Progression, Cultivation, or Xianxia series. But that's not necessarily what I'm after.

What made Cradle truly special for me was the character dynamics. I fell in love with the main cast: Lindon, Eithan, Yerin, and Mercy. Dross added an incredible fun element, and the talkative pets, Orthos and Little Blue, absolutely stole my heart. The interactions between characters felt genuine, satisfying, and incredibly enjoyable. It kept me emotionally invested throughout the series. I found myself laughing, cheering, and even shedding both happy and sad tears along the way. Oh, and the romance line was the cherry on top.

While I've compiled a long list of potential reads, I'm having trouble deciding where to go next. I'm open to any genre. What I'm really after is a series with a similar vibe of lovable characters.

Female ensemble cast,"This is gonna be a weirdly specific request, but here goes. I'm trying to find a fantasy book that has the following:
-All female ensemble with a very close bond. Think Sex In The City type of close. 
-Zero romance at all. No one is writing a letter back home to their lover, or pining after unrequited love. Not even as an offhand sub plot. 
-Oceans 8 type of story, women going in and getting shit handled and they don't need help from a man or to pretend to be men. 
-Adult fantasy with real adult problems, nothing YA.

Does this type of book exist?! I'm trying to help a friend and this is what she specifically asked for. I tried to suggest something like The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisen since there is no ""romance"" but even the relationships in that book felt like too much for her. I also suggested Lirael by Garth Nix and she said no YA.

Younger Fantasy Books where the MC makes a deal with the villian out of desperation,"This is a plot I've always enjoyed seeing in media when I was younger. I liked seeing plots where the MC is in a situation where they're desperate enough to make a deal with or accept power from the main villain and it ends up causing issues, specifically with the people around them. Usually, the motivations behind the deal are good-hearted, like they're losing their powers and need them back bc they want to protect their loved ones or a loved one is in a dire situation and they don't know how to fix it, things like that. 

I prefer male MCs &amp; no romance. I'd prefer if the book is directed towards a younger audience because it gives me the drama without the grim atmosphere but I'll take any suggestions due to the specific request, as long as it isn't incredibly dark.

"Would sexism, to the same degree as our world or at all, really exist in a magical world?","I was reading a novel and one of the characters was sexist towards women and the usual women being married off was also present. It was a slight annoyance and it got me thinking. In a world where anyone, whether young or old, man or woman can gain a massive amount of strength through magical means, would sexism really exist? In our world, sexism came about because before even civilization began woman were naturally weaker then men and had to be protected and mostly were only used to give birth to children and this ideology bled into civilization. This led to the whole woman are inferior in every aspect including intellectually prejudice that only really stopped in the recent couple of decades (not a historian so i could be wrong but i feel this was the gist of it). However, in a world full of magic and the supernatural this type of prejudice doesn't make sense because not only would the development of civilization be different but also because multiple women have shown they can be stronger for hundreds of years. Why would you look down on a woman in a world where anyone can be stronger than you? That kind of prejudice is dangerous and stupid. So why is it so common in fantasy stories? It's so unimaginative and feels like an inconsistency in the world building.",fantasy

The second book was such a hard pill to swallow for part one, I would highly look at the warning before reading this because it can be very difficult for those who have struggled in SA/trafficking/ and those topics it was an emotional roller coaster so be careful look out for your mental health and be prepared.",fantasy
"SFF Bingo: The Long Walk, by Richard Bachman aka Stephen King","Death games, as a genre, require some suspension of disbelief. ""This is a dystopia and this just happens sometimes."" In Battle Royale, one middle school class is drafted. In Hunger Games, kids are drafted from across the country, but have the opportunity to volunteer in lieu of their loved ones. In Squid Game, people in financial stress are incentivized with a huge cash prize, then given the opportunity to drop out by majority vote. In all of these cases, the reader/viewer has to set aside some of their ""oh, come on"" reaction, and go with ""this is not the way the world actually works, but what if...""

The writers have several strategies to try to get the viewers to buy in. They can worldbuild alternate-history details that emphasize how this world is not our current world, and thus make it more plausible that other things have changed, too. Hunger Games has the 12 Districts instead of 50 States. Some continuities of Battle Royale have a ""Greater East Asia Republic"" that emerged after WWII, implying that the second half of the 20th century was very different around the world. And yet, Bruce Springsteen still emerged at the same place and time to write ""Born to Run."" Curious.

Another strategy is to emphasize how brutal and cutthroat our current gameshows are already. If we're willing to watch people do stupid, embarrassing, dangerous things for a chance at lots of money, might we be willing to watch teenagers get murdered onscreen? Quoting liberally from actual gameshows in epigraphs tries to make this case, but there's a chance it backfires, if the answer is ""no, actually.""

This can easily bleed into ""hey, the in-universe audience are terrible people for enjoying this spectacle, but guess what? You, the readers, are also terrible people for enjoying the fictional spectacle. You wanted your faves to live? Well, screw you."" (This is one reason why I've only skimmed the first Hunger Games book and don't plan to read the others. It's more prominent in the manga adaptation of ""Battle Royale"" than the book or movie.) But there's also an obvious retort to this, namely: ""you wrote the book, did you want us to pick it up or not?""

Stephen King's approach to ""don't glamorize this, this is really disgusting actually"" is to focus on the physicality of the horror. The premise is that a hundred boys are walking south from Maine, four miles an hour, or else; anyone who falls below the minimum speed limit gets eliminated (from life). There are plenty of chances to be grossed out by feet, legs, lungs, appendices, guts, faces, [blood, sweat, tears](https://xkcd.com/1148/), pus, urine, feces, vomit, erections, all that good stuff. (If you thought [Abebe Bikila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abebe_Bikila)'s feet were bad, he was only running for two hours and fifteen minutes.) For sixteen-year-old boys, the fear of publicly relieving themselves is worse than dying, the emasculation of being outearned by your girlfriend is sometimes worse than physical violence, there's a lot of talk about Oedipus complex and their girlfriends' breasts, etc. They also decide that a pair of brothers entering together (so one will have to watch the other die, at least) is gross and weird, but everyone else's participation is totally fine.

Like ""Hunger Games,"" there's only one POV character, so we don't even have the potential ""decoy protagonist""/insight into different possible winners and losers that Batle Royale allows. Ray Garraty's distinguishing feature is that...he's from Maine, which is where most of the ""action"" happens, so a lot of the local fans are cheering for him for reasons that he understands are arbitrary and a little creepy. Why else should we care about him? Does he like music like Shuya or have a sickly mother to support like Gi-hun or anything? Nah. He occasionally shows his comrades basic human decency and receives it in return, but there are a hundred guys, we expect a lot of that is going on even if some of them are jerks.

The two characters who sort of have interesting motivations for joining up (if you win, you can have basically anything you want for the rest of your life, hold that thought) are Scramm and Stebbins. Scramm, though just a teenager, is already married with a baby on the way. He's practiced walking eighty miles, which is apparently more than most people do! So he figures he's a favorite and will be able to financially support his family with the prize. Stebbins seems to know too much about past contests and the weird intimacy forged among the survivors. Is he like Il-nam, just trying to revel in the suffering of others, or Shogo, trying to bring down the system? No. We do learn something interesting about him towards the end, but it doesn't really make a difference in anything else. In fact, I feel like you could randomize the order of most of the scenes and it wouldn't make a great difference--characters don't evolve, they just die gruesomely and their bodies give out on them in different ways.

Okay, so the idea is, you accept a 99% chance of death for a 1% chance of unlimited riches, and people willingly do this because we're in a dystopia controlled by the evil military? Again, I could sort of go with the suspension of disbelief if that was just ""this is the premise of the book, take it or leave it."" Instead, the more King tries to worldbuild, the less plausible I find it. We still have all this name-dropping like Tonka Trucks and Dunkin Donuts and Hank Aaron's home run record, trying to tell us that ""yes, this is still the USA, it's just evil now, or maybe the USA is already more evil than you like to think."" Most of the characters couldn't tell you themselves why they joined other than ""ehhhh I guess we must all have death wishes, huh?"" And then we find out that there are pre-qualifying mental and physical exams: ""most of the kids in the country over twelve take the tests but only one in fifty passes."" (Does that include girls?) Why are people doing this other than they don't have frontal lobes yet?

King also namedrops lots of other influences in terms of horror and/or teenage male ennui (Shirley Jackson, JD Salinger). And like, the more namedropping you have to do in order to be like ""look, these are good authors, you should all know about them!"" the less I am invested in your story. (Battle Royale was not immune from this either. We get it, you like Springsteen, but advertising for the Boss is not why I'm reading your book.)

There are a couple flickers of ""what if this is all purgatory, what if the ghosts of the other contestants are still there, what if when we die it's more of the same"" which take the horror beyond the immediate. In that sense, the weirdness/ambiguity of the end, which I would otherwise have been probably frustrated by, sort of blended into the rest of the dark vagueness and was more intriguing than frustrating.

I'm not necessarily proud of enjoying ""Battle Royale""--the prose can be mediocre, the musical allusions are a lot, maybe it makes me a terrible person for reveling in fictional violence. But in the context of these ludicrously violent death games, it's compelling to see moments of friendship or bravery or sacrifice emerge. Here, any flickers of purpose and agency are quickly swallowed up in poop and dick jokes. At least it keeps a fast pace, literally and figuratively.

Bingo: Survival.",fantasy
Rec req: Sorcerer MC with decent political intrigue and a romantic subplot,"I'm looking for books that feature a sorcerer/wizard main character of any gender who has to navigate complicated and vicious court/magical/international politics where at least some of their rivals and opponents are other mages. It does not need to start immediately, the MC may begin as an apprentice and get into the scheming gradually. 

It is also fairly important to me that the books have a decent romantic subplot, preferably with another mage. Enemies/rivals to lovers, slow burn, master/apprentice, healthy or toxic, established, long distance or downright star-crossed and others are all fair game. The romance arc does not have to appear immediately if it's a series, can be subtle without establishing a relationship, but has to be significant to the MC and preferably to the plot.

Morally grey, ambitious, conceited, snarky, manipulative characters are most welcome (though not indispensable). Would prefer it if the MC was not a mage warrior wielding a weapon, though weaponless battle mages are still fair game. The larger the timespan covered, more POVs and complex worldbuilding with detailed description of the magic system the better, but I will also accept simpler representations. 

Bonus points if generally the mages are long lived/immortal and/or have a certain disregard for regular/mortal people, mostly treating them as pawns in a game. 

My favorite work that fit this description so far was The Magister Trilogy by CS Friedman.

A Demon Builds a City: An ARC Review of The City in Glass by Nghi Vo," *This review is based on an eARC (Advance Reading Copy) provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review and can also be found* [*on my blog*](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/09/26/fantasy-novel-review-the-city-in-glass-by-nghi-vo/)*.* The City in Glass *will be released on October 1, 2024.*

I first read Nghi Vo back in 2021 when [*The Empress of Salt and Fortune* ](https://www.tarvolon.com/2021/08/12/fantasy-novella-review-the-empress-of-salt-and-fortune/)took home a well-deserved Hugo Award for Best Novella, and the beauty of her prose and richness of her settings invariably makes for good reads. The premise of *The City in Glass* didn’t necessarily jump out at me, but with it being a very short novel by such a talented author, it seemed well worth a try. 

*The City in Glass* is a novel that’s a bit hard to blurb, because it’s just not plot-driven enough to produce an obvious hook. “A demon plays *Civ*” isn’t exactly going on marketing material. But that is in many ways the vibe. The lead is a demon who has crafted a city into a place that she finds interesting—it’s never about what’s good or evil, only about interesting and boring—before a group of angels judge it for its sins and raze it to the ground. And so she sets about the long and slow task of rebuilding, with the occasional help of an angel who became corrupted in the attack. 

I was worried that this would turn into “angels are moralistic jerks, demons are the ones who are actually good” sort of story—something that’s been done many a time before and that *I* don’t find especially interesting—but Vo manages to turn it in a slightly different direction. Of course, the lead *does* see angels as moralistic jerks, but that’s mostly because they’ve foiled her own selfish plans, not out of any real sense that she’s the one in the right. And while she certainly influences her angelic frenemy to see perspectives he hadn’t previously considered, it’s not clear whether the change makes him better or whether it just makes him different. 

But this is part of what made it hard for me to really invest emotionally in the novel. There are really two major arcs, and only one of them is going anywhere in particular. The bulk of the story focuses on the slow building of the city, but there’s not a goal in mind so much as there is a series of opportunistic tweaks that will hopefully build something interesting. I joked about a demon playing *Civ*, but that’s in many ways the flavor of the major city-building narrative. The other arc, the one that does have a modicum of momentum, is an extremely slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance, presented in little snapshots separated by decades, or sometimes centuries. But even though that plot thread is clearly moving somewhere, it still carries that sense that it’s not going anywhere better, just somewhere different, and that makes it difficult to really care. 

But where *The City in Glass* shines is in the words and the scenes. Vo writes beautifully and really brings the setting to life, generating an immersion in the individual moments that makes it an engaging read even if the larger plot is absent or underwhelming. We see the city’s growth through myriad little vignettes, whether interactions with the environment or the people. And those vignettes are invariably deftly told and worthy reads. 

Overall, I expect a reader’s opinion of *The City in Glass* to depend heavily on their penchant for plot-light, “portrait of a city's growth through the years” stories. But even if there isn’t much of a driving plot, readers can always sit back and appreciate the beauty of the words. 

*Recommended if you like:* portraits of cities changing over time, slow-burn amoral enemies-to-lovers, Vo’s storytelling.

# [A Rival Most Vial by RK Ashwick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86210935-a-rival-most-vial)

&gt;Two potion shops, one heated rivalry…until hate bubbles over into something else.

&gt;Any adventurer worth their sword knows about Ambrose Beake. The proud, quiet half-elf sells the best, and only, potions in the city—until a handsome new shopkeeper named Eli opens another potion shop across the street, throwing Ambrose’s peace and ledgers far off balance.

&gt;Within weeks, they’re locked in a war of price tags and products—Ambrose’s expertise against Eli’s effortless charm. Toil leads to trouble, the safety gloves come off, and right as their rivalry reaches a boiling point…

&gt;The mayor commissions them to brew a potion together.

&gt;The task is as complex as it is lucrative, pushing both men to the limits of their abilities and patience. Yet as the fires burn and cauldrons bubble…they find a different sort of chemistry brewing.

Do you know books where the villain has more morals than the hero?,"Hi, I'm looking for books where the villain is in secret a better person than the hero. He treats the people around him better than the hero and although he committs acts that are considered morally wrong he is still a good person (for example: he protects children/ doesn't harm innocent people). And if it's not to specific: he takes in a teenager that was learning under the hero and treats him better than the hero did and becomes a mentor/father figure.

[Cultural Ask] Looking for works with a well-developed witchcraft universe (any type),"Hi everyone,

My request will not be typical for this sub but i’m asking for your personal culture and knowledge here, and I think it could be worth for everyone here !

I'm looking for works like : video games, (documentary or spell) books, (graphical) novels, manga, series, (complex/heavy/story) game board, (short) movies, web series, cartoon, web site or internet archives, photography, (youtube) music (channel), etc. that feature a well-developed witchcraft universe.

I like “instant magic” universes like Sabrina or Charmed for example but I really wanted something less maudlin / sappy and more complex in its magic universe.

It can be as dark/psychological/experimental  as colorful/simple/normal atmosphere and background. Every way of magic and magic practice.

I’d prefer something a bit niche, but I’m also open to more mainstream suggestions if they’re really worth it.

I know those things : Harry Potter, Charmed, Buffy, BeWitched, Agatha and Wanda, The Magicians, The Secret Circle, The Little Witch Academia, Ojamajo Doremi, CardCaptor Sakura, SailorMoon, Sabrina, The WitchCraft, 2015 The Witch, Magicka (a video game), Elden Ring, WITCHCRAFT. THE LIBRARY OF ESOTERICA (documentary book) and i forget some.

If you have any recommendations, I’d love to hear them, I’m open minded :)

Thanks in advance!",fantasy

Beyond Dungeon Crawler Carl: The World of LitRPGs,"Dungeon Crawler Carl is one of a handful of litRPGs that have broken into the mainstream in recent years, a major pillar in a genre that is often demonized for being poor quality, plotless, and silly. It’s also a genre that runs almost entirely on indie authors, writing stories that would largely be unpublishable by modern market standards. Sometimes for quality, but mostly for being an incredibly diverse category with some of the most niche subgenres in fiction.

I’m far from an expert, but as someone who enjoys both fantasy and litRPGs I thought I would throw in a few recommendations and suggestions ranging from mainstream to niche for fans of Dungeon Crawler Carl. By all means please add to this list with your own recs and a few sentences describing what they’re about.

Beware of Chicken by casualfarmer

One of the other pillars of mainstream litRPGs, Beware of Chicken is a hilarious slice-of-life satire of cultivation stories. Even if you’re not familiar with the genre it’s riffing, you’ll find plenty to enjoy here as a would-be superhero type warrior decides, fuck this shit and proceeds to leave to become a farmer at the far end of the kingdom. This is cozy and fun with lots of humor, wholesome found family vibes and the occasional epic throwdown too. And yes, the chicken is one of the best characters.

What the Truck: An Apocalypse LitRPG by Tom Goldstein

A trucker, a weeb, his brother, and a medic walk into an apocalypse…and chaos ensures.

Originally known simply as Battle Trucker, this is a representation of one of the main subgenres of litRPG, the apocalypse fantasy. Rather than a person from the real world getting transported into a fantasy world such as in Beware of Chicken, the fantasy comes to reality, merging with the real world with devastating results. Again lots of humor to be found here with the story following the journey of foul-mouthed Jill and her suddenly magical, monster crushing big rig, Bertha as they travel across the remains of the United States to get to her family in Boston.

An Adventure Brewing: Beers and Beards Book 1 by JollyJupiter

In the cozier corner of the litRPG world we have tales like this one. Man becomes dwarf. Man is offended by the poor quality swill the dwarves call drink. Man sets out to become the best dwarven brewer, build a tavern and save the dwarves from an eternity of mediocre alcohol. A humorous slice-of-life adventure for fans of its non-litRPG cousins like Legends &amp; Lattes.

All the Skills by Honor Rae

One of my personal favorites, this is a deckbuilding litRPG where the world’s magic is focused around, you guessed it, magical cards not unlike those of our favorite TCGs. Featuring plenty of dragons and epic stakes, this is also an example of a non-isekai where the main character is born and grew up in this world. He also doesn’t have any combat cards, meaning he learns to use his abilities to triumph over adversity in some very unusual ways. Also features one of the best dragon companions since Temeraire.

This is just scratching the surface of the genre and is by necessity limited by my own experiences and personal tastes. There are many, many more out there! I tend to gravitate mostly toward stories with characters I enjoy reading about, so I'm a lot less focused on the magic systems and whatnot and my choices reflect this. All of the stories on this list are available on KU and are not the most visible, being too new or too overshadowed by their more popular progression cousins like Primal Hunter or He Who Fights with Monsters.",fantasy
I think I might have to quit my quest to complete Raymond E Feist’s Riftwar saga,"Like many children of the 1980s-90s, Feist’s series was one of my introductions to classic fantasy. After Dragonlance and the Belgariad, it was one of the first ‘grown up’ fantasies that I read. But I stopped halfway through the Serpantwar quartet, and I never went back because by that time I was deep into The Wheel of Time and A Song of Ice and Fire. But having gradually acquired most of Feist's books, I decided to start the series again from the beginning and complete the whole thing. Except now I'm kind of burned out and it bums me out.

First up, Magician – I recall liking this as a teen but I didn't remember much of the specifics. Rereading it as an adult, it is quite slow and very obviously patterned on the Lord Of The Rings for the first half. But on the whole it is still an engaging story and interesting introduction to the world of Midkemia.

Silverthorn and A Darkness at Sethanon – I enjoyed these even more than I recall. I think with these Feist found a balance between copying Tolkien and doing his own thing; keeping the D&amp;D elements but writing slightly more interesting characters. I love how these books start with a small scale story of street thieves and assassination attempts, and gradually expand into massive cosmic events. That's the feeling I love about classic epic fantasy from the 80s – the steadily increasing sense of scale.

The Empire trilogy with Janny Wurts – I read these as a teen as well, but a torture scene in the third book traumatised me so much that I kind of blocked them from my mind. Rereading them now I was blown away by how much I enjoyed these now that I've read a lot more politically oriented fantasy. This was more engaging to me then when I was a teen, and I think these books hold up the best in terms of the depth of characters and the balance of worldbuilding and action – probably due to Wurst writing the prose.

Prince Of The Blood and The King’s Buccaneer – I also enjoyed these more than I recalled. I think both of these are the two strongest single volumes of Feist’s series. They expand the world of Midkemia but without going to big into cosmological lore. They introduce a lot of new characters and cultures and settings but the scale of the story is kept focused on the characters which makes it more engaging.

Shadow Of A Dark Queen and Rise Of A Merchant Prince these were the last two books I read as a teen I remember not liking them as much, and feeling that this series was losing its steam. On re-read, I like the first volume quite a lot. It's grittier than previous books, like a fantasy version of The Dirty Dozen. This has classic underdog feel that was present in Magician and Silverthorn. But it does feel like it's rehashing elements of The King’s Buccaneer. The second book was interesting because it takes a completely different perspective, focusing on economic aspects of the fantasy world which was interesting. Except that I feel like Feist failed to make Roo a sympathetic character.  The book feels like it's caught between being an experiment with a different style and having to carry the plot of this quartet forward.

Rage Of A Demon King and Shards Of A Broken Crown – This is where to me it feels like the wheels came off this series. These were the first books that were completely new to me as an adult and it's remarkable how much of a drop quality there is. The main characters from the preceding books are relegated to supporting roles, and Feist focuses more on characters who already completed their character arcs in previous books. These two books jump around a lot, showing this war from different angles but without any sense of momentum. It's just a bunch of stuff happening. Subplots are set up and the pay off is abrupt or happens off-screen. Also, the expanding cosmic lore felt slapdash. I noticed in these books as a teen that every revelation was that there was an even bigger villain behind the big villain who was behind the small villain. We went from dark elves being manipulated by serpent people being manipulated by demons to being manipulated by an evil god. 

Krondor: The Betrayal – I had high hopes for this interquel, because the blurb made it seem like a return to the small scale of the early books. That's how it starts, but then again halfway through it turns into another series of epic battles repeating the same motifs: dark elves trying to get to the city of Sethanon to unleash ancient demonic powers blah blah blah. And I couldn't help but notice how flavourless Fiest’s writing has become compared to what he's trying to describe. There are sentences like “There was a series of crystal columns” or “The dogs suddenly disappeared” and there's no sense of what it felt or sounded like or anything.

So in the end, I think I've just lost interest in this series. Feist seems to have abandoned most of the world’s potential by continuously regurgitating the same few ideas. An even bigger problem is that it’s now impossible to differentiate his characters. If I was to read a random passage of an internal monologue from one of the protagonists from the last six books in the series, I don't know that if I couldn't differentiate which protagonist it was they all have a similar tone and sense of humour. None of them have any internal conflicts or doubts anymore. Moreover, it's hard to ignore how male-centric this series is. There is one notable female character for every ten notable male characters, and those female characters are almost all defined by being a relative or love interest of a male character. Even if you don't think that gender parity is necessary for a good story, in this case it all feels so passionless. Any romances are superficial; there's no lust or melodrama. There're only characters motivated by duty and desperation.

So sad to say I’m giving up, unless someone can convince me that this story picks up. I’d like to hear your thoughts, especially if you’re a Feist superfan who can tell me what I’m missing.",fantasy

Music &amp; Musicians in Fantasy ,"When I first read The Name of the Wind (yes, I know, it has issues and not everyone likes it) , I was overjoyed to finnaly read a story told by a musician that captured how vital music is to them. 

For me, the most memorable and wonderful moments of that book where the moments where Kvothe talks about performing (by himself, yes, but even more poignantly, when he performs with others) or composing or simply playing music to self soothe, or about how much his lute means to him (the destruction of his first lute was heartbreaking to him and to me, especially since I empathized heavily with how having that lute and playing it after the traumatic events that left him an orphan helped keep him at least partially sane), or how the absence of being able to play music was a quiet, stealthy death of the soul whose severity was only made clear when one can finally play again. 

I've never come across another book in which the emotional, internal experience of being a musician - professional or amateur - was so beautifully and (for me) accurately written. 

Are there any other musicians out there who felt similarly? 

Do any of you have recommendations for books where the main character is a musician where their POV, at least in this respect, is done well? 

P.S. I also loved how so many moments of dialogue between Kvothe and his father, or when Kvothe is telling a story, are actually poems or couplets, but are so masterfully integrated into the prose that you don't notice at first/it feels simply like natural speech.

Hailing Frequencies: the promotional SF/F magazine from Waldenbooks,"Waldenbooks (RIP) used to put out a sci-fi/fantasy publication called Hailing Frequencies. This was an in-house publication that they would put in your bag if you purchased a sci-fi or fantasy novel or game. The magazine included interviews from up-and-coming SFF authors as well as a list of upcoming publications as well as their picks for the best new SFF books.

This was in an era when Waldenbooks not only operated over 1,200 stores, they were owned by Kmart, which not only sold books itself but which also owned at least nine chains of bookstores (Waldenbooks, WaldenKids, Brentano's, Borders, All Wound Up, Day By Day Calendar Company, Bassett Book Shop, Coles Book Shops, and Coopersmith).\* There probably was no bigger ""catch"" for a SFF author than getting a featured spot in Waldenbooks/Borders promotional publications because they owned so many bookstore chains.

I know there were at least 11 issues of the magazine, which they put out quarterly. I have issues from 1992 to 1995. Does anyone know what happened to the magazine? When did it come to an end?

Stone of Farewell- A Review ,"

Initial thoughts:
After a brief visit to the world of Malazan, I have come back to the lands of Osten Ard and man it’s like coming home. Despite having never read it, I just feel nostalgic about this series. It’s like being wrapped in this blanket of melancholic joy, and that’s really not a feeling I’ve gotten from any other series before, so I’m very happy to be back and man what a book this is!

Pacing:
I enjoyed The Dragonbone Chair immensely when I read it, in fact I enjoyed it so much I wrote what is probably my longest and most thought out review ever. So to the surprise of probably no one, I also adored Stone of Farewell. Something that I gave The Dragonbone Chair props for was that it really took its time in the telling, it didn’t rush through the story but instead fleshed out the scenery  and because of that the world felt very real. I think Stone of Farewell does a similar thing, however I also think that this book’s pacing is improved because the story goes by a little faster. I’m not sure if that’s just because DBC is pretty slow or because Willams has increased the amount of stuff going on but it’s a good change in my eyes.
POVs/characters:
Another delightful change is the addition of more POVS in this book! DBC is very focused on the journey of Simon and while Simon is still very much the central character for Stone of Farewell, Willams opens up his world by giving us way more characters and increasing the amount of time they have on the page. I really enjoy seeing what everyone is up to and the ripple effects from certain actions both good and bad. think all of the plots so far interest me a lot. I also really dig the myserious aspect of this series, there are so many unanswered questions from what is the Storm King’s true goal to what is the significance of the three swords? It seems every section of this book was designed to show that there’s way more depth to this word even though I feel like I know the world so well. 
Dialogue:
Another thing that I’m not certain I touched on in my last review is the dialogue. Honestly nobody loves good dialogue like me and Willams absolutely delivered in this book. There’s just something about the mix of his prose and character work that really makes even the most simple of conversations seem to matter and have weight. It’s absolutely brilliant stuff and I want more.

The Magic/ Sithi:
I find that one of the most difficult or tricky parts of writing fantasy must be about how and when to use magic and what magic looks like. For me I’ve always been a fan of soft magic,I don’t need this explained or examined, I just want the magic to happen and be cool. Well guess what? Willams nails it! The magic feels so surreal. It's esoteric in the best way, it’s not overly convoluted nor is it incredibly simple, the Art is just wrapped in mystery and has some level of cost and I love that! It’s incredibly well handled in my view.


I also think that if you’re going to have other races, especially elves in your fantasy world, you’ve got to make them very distinct from humans. One of the issues I have with Malazan that I realized while reading this book is that Erikson despite giving various backgrounds to the different races, somehow makes them all feel the same or very human at least. I dislike that, male elves or whatever race the Sithi are so weird and alien compared to humans, they actually feel ancient and like a completely foreign race to their human counterparts. Again Willams nails it!

The only Con-
I will say that the first two sections of this book has me really thinking I’d give it a 10, unfortunately the last section while amazing caught me by surprise and slightly spoiled my feelings. I was nearing the end, perhaps less than 3 hour and more POVs kept coming that had little to do with the stone of farewell, Simon or Josua and while I really liked the final chapter, I thought focusing on these other characters was a little odd. In retrospect I get it, but I’m still soured by my own expectations I suppose. Otherwise the book is perfect.

Final thoughts/ opinions:
I cannot yet say if Memory, Sorrow and Thorn will be my favorite fantasy series ever but I do believe that from what I’ve read so far, it may be the “best” fantasy. What I mean by best is that Tad Williams has perfected the fantasy formula in a way that no author, at least that I have read has. This man looked at what Tokien did with Lord of the rings, he looked at what CS Lewis did with Chronicles of Narnia, and at what Howard did with Conan and seemed to ask himself “how can I take this and give it the modern age.” I have always enjoyed the vibe that Lord of the rings has despite it not being my favorite fantasy series. I’ve always enjoyed that there’s this sense of grandness, adventure and depth that very few fantasy writers ever get close to replicating but Willams for me is the author who’s done it the best. I don’t think Tad is ripping off Lord of the Rings like so many authors of his day, but he’s really looking at the groundwork that Tolkien built for modern fantasy and asking how can I take these ideas and make them my own? There’s a sense when you read these books that this is not just a story, but rather almost an epic brought out of some ancient time that we have lost. I’m not saying that this is the Iliad or the Odyssey or even the “modern” LOTR, but what I am saying is that so far Memory Sorrow and Thorn is exactly how I’ve always thought fantasy should be written. It should be able to acknowledge all that has come before it while also remaining unique. It should be able to play with moral, religious and philosophical ideas and principles but never bash you over the head with it. It should tell a story that dosent feel like fiction but rather something from a bygone era that we’ve somehow lost. It should be mysterious, romantic and most of all epic.  So far, Memory Sorrow and Thorn does all of this and it does it with a grace that sings to me as a life long fan of fantasy. Stone of Farewell is an excellent second entry, it does everything The Dragonbone Chair did so well, and in many ways improves upon the foundation. This series truly is something special and if you haven’t read it yet and love fantasy, please do. I really cannot recommend these books enough. I’m certain I’ll have more to say when I finish To Green Angel Tower, but until then I give Stone of Farewell a whopping 9.5/10

I read 5 of T. Kingfisher's work back to back. ,"T. Kingfisher writes a lot of gothic fiction, dark fairytales, and horror. I had read ""The Hollow Ones"" by her last year and absolutely loved it. One of my top 5 favorite horror books. This year I read her novella, ""What Moves the Dead"" and immediately put 5 more of her books on hold, including the sequel ""What Feasts at Night"".   Her writing is close to perfect for what I want in gothic fiction/dark fairytales.  I currently have ""A Sorceress Comes to Call"" on hold at the library (#27).

Besides the genres of the books, I really like her stories as it keeps romance to a minimum, features older characters, has LGBTQIA+ representation, and all of the characters felt unique.  While I'm taking a break from her writing for now, I will definitely read more in the future.

The five books/novellas I read, in order, were:

1. ""What Moves the Dead"" Bingo: First in a series, character with a disability, bookclub
2. ""What Feasts at Night"" Bingo: character with a disability (hard), Dreams,  2024,  bookclub
3. ""A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking"" Survival (hard), bookclub
4. ""Nettle and Bone"" Under the Surface, Survival (hard), bookclub
5. ""The Twisted Ones"" , Eldritch Creatures (hard),  Survival (hard),  Set in a Small Town (hard), bookclub 

**""What Moves the Dead"" and ""What Feasts at Night""**

Two novellas in the ""Sworn Soldier"" series.  The series as a whole is a 4/5 for me.   The first one is a retelling of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" from an outsiders viewpoint and focuses heavily on the landscape. I have not read ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" so I have no opinions on if it was a good retelling or not. Both novellas have the same main character, Alex whom is getting tangled up in terrifying situations. The first one involves fungi, reanimation,  and illness. Very much a stereotypical gothic fiction. The second one involves spirits, folklore, and PTSD from war.

What I particularly like about these stories is the incorporation of a nonbinary character, the landscape settings, an English gentlewoman that studies fungi, and the romance is between two side characters that are older.  I will read all that are published in this series.

**A Wizard's Guide To Defensive Baking**

A solid 3/5. The book is technically YA and not quite gothic fiction, but as elements of dark fairytales.  It definitely makes me think of ""Shrek"". There are some people in this world that have powers, including the main character, that are a bit ""random"". One of the more important characters can only make dead horses walk. Another character can only blend in with the shadows. The main character can only work with bread and as a series of unfortunate events is the only wizard left in the city when they are attacked.

I really loved the dark whimsical elements and the creativeness of how a teenage girl can protect a city only using bread (spoiler alert: it involves malicious gingerbread men). T. Kingfisher mentions in the back acknowledgements that she had a difficult time selling the book under her actual name, Ursula Vernon, because everyone thought kids would be scared (to be honest, I highly doubt most kids would find anything in this book actually scary) and unfortunately you can tell. She had to do a lot of changes while trying to get it sold to various publishers and as a result the main character felt a bit too.. childish for a 14 year old at times. The Duchess and Golden General didn't feel realistic and felt like caricatures. The middle was the weakest, but the ending was strong.   I would read a sequel.

**Nettle and Bone**

My favorite work of the 5 that I had read and is a solid 5/5. A 30 yr old princess finds out her older sister is being abused by her prince. No one will do anything about it, so she decides she will just have to go on an adventure and kill the prince.

The story to me felt like the perfect Dark Fairytale. Nothing really gory or violent, but a lot of the whimsical elements were dark/unusual and one of the main characters was a gravewitch. Godmothers make an appearance and have a unique twist. There is romance in the book, but it doesn't necessarily feel forced.  I hope there is a sequel.

**The Twisted Ones**

The only one of the 5 that I would classify as ""horror"" (particularly folklore horror). A 4/5 for me. A 30 something year old woman is cleaning out her grandmothers hoarder house when she comes  across a book/journal written by her step grandfather. She stumbles into a creepy creepy land and as a result is being stalked by things in the woods.

I do not believe in anything supernatural related- I'm an atheist - but damn was I jumping at noises and shadows while reading this at night.  She did a superb job with the setting and characters.  It would be a great book to read for Halloween.

My major complaint was it had a great creepy unsettling build up... and then the ""climax"" part of it it was didn't really deliver on the creepiness. It definitely lost its spookiness and in my opinion should have just been removed all together with the climax being shifted to events that are near the end of the book.",fantasy

Looking for fantasy books that have lots of creative magic ,"Hello everyone, I've been really craving a book (adult, not YA) that has that feeling of joy that magic exists, in which the characters actually do and study a lot of magic and it is creative. I guess the fantasy I've been reading lately feels a bit too mechanic? Like the characters are surrounded by magic, but never really explore the possibilities of that and never truly get to enjoy it/immerse themselves and have fun with it. A book that has a plot that actually gives them time to do that (since the characters are usually too busy with other stuff). Thanks! ",fantasy

Review - City in the Dragon's Eye by Jordan Loyal Short - An indie masterpiece 5/5,"https://preview.redd.it/bdo76mo191rd1.jpg?width=940&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ef94bff52d0265ff7776e1f3db12e27961adf5

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-city-in-the-dragons-eye-by-jordan-loyal-short/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-city-in-the-dragons-eye-by-jordan-loyal-short/)

CITY IN THE DRAGON’S EYE by Jordan Loyal Short is one of the best fantasy novels written in 2024 and like the author’s DREADBOUND ODE series or Richard Nell’s KINGS OF PARADISE, probably the best thing you can get for “fantasy literature” on Kindle Unlimited. If you think this is overly high praise, take my advice when I say that this is a five-star book of an actual scale were five means “fantastic” not “I have no real complaints and don’t want to undermine the author due to the internet algorithm gods.”

The premise is that this takes place in a 17th-to-19th century-esque steampunk world where magic exists alongside science, but it lacks the “cutesy” quality of much steampunk. It also has elements of the Post-WW1 era where the protagonist’s country has just lost a massive war with many veterans left broken by the experience while others feel they were betrayed by their leaders surrendering.

Viktor has a particularly problematic affliction, though, in that he now has scales across his body from where he used magic that has infected him with dragon. I mean that literally in that people who use too much magic are turned into dragons and treated like lepers as it happens. He’s fired from every job and made an outcast. Seeking a cure so that he doesn’t have to spend the rest of his life in misery, he ends up uncovering a secret society that wishes to start a new war. Victor is no hero, though. He just wants to get cured of what is probably insoluble.

There’s also Izola, who is working at a university with her ex-husband. Unfortunately, the latter has just achieved tenure and finds the prospect of his disgruntled former spouse moving up the ranks to be intolerable. Having her career scuttled in the most painfully banal way possible, Izola searches for another way to distinguish herself. Her path crosses with Viktor in a way that goes in several unexpected directions.

The third protagonist of the work is an incredibly foolish young dandy named Devin who has coasted his entire life on his father’s wealth as well as power. Unfortunately, this has left him with an overinflated sense of importance that gets him into incredible trouble when he attempts to fix a fight for some quick cash, only to run afoul of a local crime lord. Lacking any real resources, he ends up not so much over his head but several fathoms down.

Jordan Loyal Short is a fantastic writer of prose but his biggest skill is that he’s extremely good at creating vivid believable characters that aren’t typical of fantasy. Viktor’s worries about whether he’ll ever get a girl with his “tumor” or his family now that he can’t hold down a job are infinitely more relatable than your typical hero’s issue with a dark lord. Izola’s inability to be seen at her place of work and regrets about having gotten married too young to a professor who turned out to be only interested in her when she was a worshipful young teacher’s assistant is familiar in a way that former assassin or princess isn’t. Yet, this is still a fantastical world filled with monsters and sorcery.

If I had any complaints about the book, it would be that I think naming the secret society “The Thule Society” was a bit too on the nose. It’s like the author didn’t trust us to get the parallels with the Weimar Republic. Despite that, this is a wholly original secondary world with more allusions to early 20th century history than actual parallels.

In conclusion, if you’re looking for a fantastic new read this Fall then I think you could do far worse than pick this one up. Jordan Loyal Short is an author who manages to be dark without being grimdark and authentic when other authors are archetypal. The fact he’s an indie author versus a mass published one is almost as a shame as I think everyone should try this out.",fantasy

Book with female protagonist in her late 20´s,"Hi y´all,

I´m a bit tired of YA/NA and protagonist without at least a bit of life experience and looking for (mostly fantasy) books with female leads that are in their late 20´s. A romance element or love interest (of whichever sex/gender) would be nice but is not essential.

I know people like Ilona Andrews and Jeanine Frost (whom I´ve read) but I find the warrior type of heroine a bit boring and hard to relate to.  
I fell like I just want a well fleshed-out human being I can connect with and some solid world building rather than a huge amount of action.

Does any of you have recs?

Thanks! :D ",fantasy

The Second Apocalypse- Need Help,"I have had a love hate relationship with this series. I took me 3 years to read the first trilogy, and in the last month I've gone through books 4-6 of the Aspect-Emperor series. I am 85% of the way through the Great Ordeal...and I am having trouble going on. 

It's a few things:

* This is most miserable fantasy I have ever read. I am a veteran of the genre (went through everything from Ice and Fire to Malazan, First Law and everything in between, and I struggle with how bleak and awful everything is. All the characters are terrible save my boy Achamian. And it just keeps getting worse.
* This series is the closest to a Souls game in vibe I have ever seen, and it makes me understand that it is much easier playing through a hopeless world than reading through it. There are no heroes, only people who keep getting mislead and manipulated.
* It is silly epic, but also, almost purposely obtuse at times? Especially with some of the weirder chapters in the Great Ordeal. 

So here is my ask for anyone who got this far....convince me to finish. If you can.",fantasy

I want something where the hero has his own goal to accomplish while just trying to stay alive. I want something where the hero(s), if they were to face the big bad, would simply get rolled over, ideally not even noticed.",fantasy

What books had you rooting for the villain instead of the heroes? ,"Hey, [](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/). What have been some books that made you wish for the bad guys to win? It could be because their motivations made more sense, they were more likeable, the writer relying on deus ex machina to make the heroes win or just because the protagonists were annoying.

It recently happened with The Lies of Locke Lamora (excellent writing, mediocre story). I just finished the whole book and I was actually bummed out by the climax which has the bad guy &gt;!get killed by the protagonist.!&lt;

The motivations of the villain, &gt;!which revolved around revenge, and their means, namely, killing criminals and the nobility who together preyed upon and oppressed the people of Camorr, seemed nobler, or at least less bad, than those of the protagonists who just wanted to swindle and defraud people for fun without a care for the misery, and poverty around them. The protagonists would have let the villain get away with anything as long as they were left alone while the villain would have let no one come in the way of their revenge.!&lt; This drive made the villain much more compelling than the mucking about of the heroes who are showered by deus ex machinas throughout the story. &gt;!The mage character gets defeated, mutilated and tortured because he decides to change the order he would kill his targets at the last moment. The villain gets beaten by the worst fighter in the story because he gets distracted by a coin toss. The protagonist is able to stop the villain's big plan because it all gets revealed to him at just the right moment. His best friend is also the best fighter in the whole city. The villain on the other hand became what he is all for the sake of revenge. Becoming the second most powerful person in the city does not even matter to him, he is willing to give away all that power and all that wealth for his goals.!&lt;",fantasy

So. Do you know any books with something like this? Thanks in advance.",fantasy
The Lost Metal Review - Explosive Fun with Deep Character Moments!,"Era 2 felt like a cup of fresh water, a really good conclusion to deep characters. In this book, Cosmere lore expanded greatly, and I absolutely love the humor and action that this series provides. Especially because I experienced the entire series with the GraphicAudio editions. 

I loved this book, and era 2 as a whole but also I'm having a lot of issues with it too which I'll comment on them in this review. 

One of the most striking aspects of The Lost Metal is how Wax and Wayne mirror the dynamic of Hadrian and Royce from the *Riyria* series. Wax, much like Hadrian, is a brooding yet honorable character, driven by a personal code and a deep desire to protect others while seeking his own identity. Wayne, on the other hand, shares the clever, trickster spirit of Royce, balancing out the weightier moments with humor and unpredictability. And also having a deep complexity that we as readers only discover as we near towards the end of series. When I was searching frantically for books similar to Riyria, you often see Locke Lamora recommended, but not as much Wax and Wayne. Wonder why?

I would totally recommend reading Era 2, especially if you read Era 1, the action is amazing and the characters are all unique and interesting. Especially Wayne's arc. I went from disliking him to enjoying all the moments he's on page. Same to Marasi character arc. Wayne and Marasi were certainly the highlight of this last book too.

From now on I'll go on spoilers for The Lost Metal and bits and pieces of Cosmere at large.

The last book of Era 2 was a mixed bag for me. 

One thing I do enjoy a lot about Wax and Wayne, is how both of them represents Harmony aspects in one way or another. For example Wayne dying in a ruinous explosion to preserve millions of lives. Or Wax ruining over two hundred lives in a fight for the same reason. This aspect can be seen a lot in the entire series, and it's at times very subtle. 

Wayne character was superb. I felt moved by the way he was trying to be a better person. And still failing and thinking he's worthless, because he always ends up doing the same toxic actions. It's easy to relate to that too. And the conversation he had with Wax, about not needing forgiveness, about changing into someone better that helps people. Seeing the way he uses his wealth, which was such an cool twist to the character too. It was so emotional, and deep. 

Say one thing about Brandon Sanderson, say he writes amazing characters struggling with mental health. 

Another thing that surprised me is meeting Moonlight! The Emperor's Soul was my first Cosmere novel and one of the first published fantasy books I've read. And I just loved the entire thing. So seeing that character again, just felt amazing. Also I love how much of Cosmere is being shown in this finale, it creates for a lot of theorizing and discussions around it. And I absolutely love delving into lore and theories of fantasy series.

Lastly, for the positive things, the ending was phenomenal. Wayne's sacrifice, the epilogues, Marasi refusing to join the Ghostbloods, were all on point. Wayne character arc becoming so deep and complex comparing with the time we meet him just makes it all worth it. I felt very emotional during my beach walk while listening to the conversation between him and Harmony and only then I realized how he connects to the aspects of said god too.

But I felt that a lot of story and set ups were being sacrificed for Era 3. The entire Bands of Mourning arc, considering last book too, was sacrificed for Era 3 probably. We spend so much time into that arc, and even Steris, which was amazing in book three, was kind of underutilized, for a set up. I feel like the entire fiasco with the bands, from giving them away, everyone's reactions, knowing there's a play but unable to act on that knowledge, just felt so dumb. I guess dumb things happen like this all the time in real life. But it doesn't excuse it. Somehow Sanderson managed to set up a scene where he gives the bands away to another country, where the characters action, feel like their own actions but still feel stupid. It's impressive really and it bothered me a bit. Because of sacrifices like this, I often got the feeling that some chapters really dragged, and some others were rushed. So the pacing was really off and on right until the end.

Another plot that I felt negative about was the whole arc where Wax and Wayne has to fight people that have studied the duo and are trying to become them. Even having same powers and all. A cheap evil twin trope. I'm not sure what was the author trying to achieve here. None of those two new enemies were set up or had enough page time to feel meaningful. They were just annoying and forgettable. Hell, I just finished the series a few hours ago and can't event remember their names. 

And right before their big epic fight, we have this scene where Wax comes to terms that he can also be Ruin when he's pushed enough. And we are being TOLD about this epic fight where he downs like two hundred people! The downside? Is that we are being told about it. We barely see it, and I was listening to the dramatized version too! So after being told that Wax is a tempest and he killed two hundred people, out of sheer urgency, then we take a nice break, so Wayne can deliver a ten hour speech to the last guards on how they can leave and they won't be shoot. In retrospect that scene was funny, like yeah you killed so many, out of urgency to save millions but let's wait a bit to save these last guards. It's so much like Wayne. 

Then we see Telsin, the villain of this entire era. Sure Autonomy is the villain, but Telsin is the focus here. And she's very one-dimensional. I couldn't connect with her at all. Could not understand her aside from the savior and better-than-you complex. And her end just goes by so fast, barely mattered. I'm genuinely disappointed by the villain of this series and honestly excepted much more. But what can you do? At least the entire subplot with Marasi and the kidnapped people was interesting as hell. Weird too, because I couldn't help to ask, how is an organization so capable of operating for so long, without dissenters trickling in and out of it. Maybe Autonomy interfered or something. 

Now let's talk about Wax. I didn't mention him much in this review, because I don't have much to say. I got annoyed a lot, of how brooding he is during the entire time. Every time he's on page, aside from a few fun interactions with Wayne, he's just broods and broods. It got really hard to like him. Even when he goes on rampage in the finale, he blames Harmony for it right after. Which is just ehh.

As for the last negative point I wanna talk about, is the theme and stakes. I'm sure this book and series has a lot of themes around it, but there's one specifically that I liked. About helping people, about just being helpful, becoming a better person and all that. I loved that! Just that the stakes didn't really reflect that. When you have world-ending stakes, and you try to conclude the story with the theme of helping people just feels off. I wish at least we could see scenes where our characters actually help people during part one. 

In retrospect, *Mistborn Era 2* was a wild ride, filled with unforgettable characters and moments of deep emotional resonance. For Cosmere fans, or readers looking for a fresh take on fantasy, Wax and Wayne are worthy successors, especially for those who loved characters like Hadrian and Royce. While Era 2 isn’t without its flaws, it’s a deeply rewarding read for anyone invested in Scadrial and the larger Cosmere. Plus, if you've read Era 1, the abundance of Easter eggs and references to past characters adds an extra layer of satisfaction.

Well, I ain't sayin' this book will change your life… but it might just make you laugh, cry, and maybe blow somethin' up along the way. So, y’know, small stuff.

Cheers!

Looking For Recommendations: Fantasy or Science Fiction MC Who Exclusively Uses A European Two-handed Longsword ,"So I like to hyper fixate and I'm currently hyper-fixating on European two handed longswords. I've seen them mentioned in a few books and I know The Witcher series and Game of Thrones both feature main characters with longswords. So, I'm looking for recommendations for main characters who are described as using a European style two-handed longsword as their main weapon. Honestly if it's a European style two-handed sword either longsword or even going into greatsword territory that is sufficient (I've read Wheel of Time and while they feature two-handed swords it's not what I'm looking for). A shield is pretty much a no go. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!

If anybody wants to read my many quibbles they are behind the spoilers

&gt;!Why wouldn't Kel Command disrank Jedao hundreds of years ago? Seems like an obvious safety measure - even before he got a body pulling rank allowed him to play mind games with his host - why not go a safer route without any obvious downsides?!&lt;

&gt;!Will we be ever told who sent orders to the swarm in the beginning of the second book to wait for ""Captain Kel Cheris""?!&lt;

&gt;!The whole deal with presenting Jedao's identity to heretics in the fortress. The heritics' intelligencer clearly outlined three possibilities: someone pretending to be Jedao, Jedao obediently working for Kel, Jedao unleashed. They would only want to work with the third possibility. But the swarm defeating shields doesn't actually prove anything - it's not like Jedao is the only person in the universe who could have guessed. For that matter for someone more trustworthy Kel Command might have released full data on the shields and made the task much easier. And him sending a sacrificial officer at most proves it's Jedao (though again with how expendable Kel treat their own I cannot see why it cannot be Kel), but says nothing whether he's for or against hexarchate!&lt;

&gt;!In general first peaceful transfer of troops is weird. Heretics did seem to have a significant force advantage within the Fortress (especially given how effective their resistance is once the ruse is discovered), so why are they not content to put down loyalist resistance on their own instead of taking a risk and admitting questionably loyal troops? On the other hand Jedao says ""we cannot shoot our way down"" so the sacrifice of a cindermoth commander is needed... and then couple of chapters later they exactly proceed to shoot their way down for more troop transfers!!&lt;

&gt;!In general handling of classified matters in the first book makes me think think that the people handling classification wanted that swarm to lose. Which again - if Kel Command thought Jedao winning is too risky why send him at all? If Jedao winning can be dealt with (as almost happened in the story except Cheris made an unexpected choice) then why withold information? Other people besides Jedao can be memory wiped (it is mentioned as a standard precaution) or even killed as it happened. The only way out I can imagine is that there are intra-Kel factions where dominant one sends Jedao and the underground one sabotages him, but seems a little bit too contrived? In your opinion, do we get explanation for that?!&lt;

&gt;!Finally what we see of the hexarchate is so hillariously disfunctional that it breaks suspension of disbelief for me that they can be that boot stamping on the human face. The factions don't even seem to pretend to work together for the stability of the existing state. When Shuos infiltrator is caught by Kel Shuos hexarch openly states ""give her back or I will sabotage the vital war effort in the middle of the war with external enemy"", and the other hexarchs are... fine with that? Nobody tries to maintain the balance of power? Kel does not threaten to bomb Shuos stations in return? Or the part where Andan find that showing dramas depicting Jedao in favourable light is profitable and again, Shuos need to pay them off so they stop it? It is not presented as unprecedented moment of tension, so it seems as if it was that way for decades at least. Or Andan can spend half of cindermoth's - biggest existing warship - cost on a fast pleasure craft? Any comparision between RL luxury vehicles and combat vehicles suggests it is an abusrdity.

Everyone is sleeping on The Dandelion Dynasty series by Ken Liu ,"I'm wrapping up Speaking Bones, the fourth and final book in Ken Liu's fantastic Dandelion Dynasty series and I have been seeking out opinions, discussions, reviews, etc to engage with post-read and the landscape is surprisingly sparse for a series that I believe truly delivers on its promise. So I'm going to do my best to provide a spoiler-free endorsement here.

**High-Level Overview:**

The Dandelion Dynasty is not standard fantasy, it reads like and is shaped more like a historical epic that mixes in bits of fantasy, philosophy, and science/engineering as it goes. The major storylines develop over the span of decades allowing the plot and characters to grow naturally and for the world to change with them. I've read criticism about this pacing but I actually think it helps enhance my bond with the characters and world rather than take away from it. As time passes, actions from earlier books turn into part of the history and legend of the world, it becomes reflexive and reinforcing in structure. The stakes are escalated and I always have a good idea of timeline which helps me visually organize things in my head better than a lot of other epic fantasy series.

**World:**

There is a grounded sense of place, Liu does a fantastic job mixing in all the dynamic systems of the world from economics to education to arts to religion to create a living and breathing setting that the reader cares about. The islands of Dara and later Ukyu/Gonde are not so dissimilar from Earth but the Gods indirectly interfere and there are other creatures and wonders to differentiate it enough to keep things interesting.

**Characters:**

I have read criticism that it often feels like the characters are written like they are historical figures in a history book. There is some distance in the POV to where you do not get the moment to moment emotional play-by-play for each character but I think the play-like drama that Ken Liu uses is really effective in crafting striking and lasting characters. There is a meticulousness to setting up motivations and backstories for all major characters that really fit well together with the directions of the plot. It forms an intricate web, not quite on the scale of a Wheel of Time or Song of Ice and Fire, but just large enough to keep everything in your head but still feel a broad world.

**Magic/Fighting:**

In an odd way, I think this is where the series really shines. There are numerous battles throughout the series on a large scale and they are all expertly written and distinct. Liu really shows an appreciation for coming up with creative fighting set ups and each battle has a series of gambits and counters from both sides that kept me guessing as a reader. There are fantastical creatures and bits at play here but there is not really direct magic in any form, most of the surprise comes from feats of science and engineering.

**Prose:**

These are beautifully written books. The writing is surprisingly nimble for books as dense as these are. I think the highest praise you can give prose is that you do not notice it, it never brought me out of the experience of reading the book. I highlighted many passages or phrases. Pacing is a bit wonky like it is with any long series. I think even when the books get a bit slow, the slow parts are still fun. 

**Ratings:** 

*The Grace of Kings (Book 1):* **4 out of 5**, maybe the weakest in the series but still a good introduction.

*The Wall of Storms (Book 2)****:*** **5 out of 5**, best book in the series. One of the best individual fantasy books I've read.

*The Veiled Throne (Book 3):* **4 out of 5**, the second weakest. It felt a bit padded out in the back half.

*Speaking Bones (Book 4):* **5 out of 5**, really strong finish. It kept me guessing until the end.

For reference, my rating scale is typically:

1-Star: This is a book that infuriated me in some way and I will probably have a rant about it.

2-Star: This is a book that is majorly flawed or boring. One or two things might have stuck out to me as good.

3-Star: This is a pleasant read, not something I feel strongly one way or another about. It is possible it is a really good book with one glaring flaw as well.

4-Star: One of the better books I have read in a year. I was engrossed the whole way but there may have been a few small issues or it just does not have the last bit of oomph.

5-Star: My mind should be racing after finishing a 5-star book. I either need to dive in deeper and find more content about this book or discuss it with someone else. There are maybe a handful of books I would give this to in a good year.

[Review] Temper the Dark L. Ryan Storms (SPFBO 10),"**I read this for SPFBO. My review only. More about the contest and links at the bottom.**

**Temper the Dark** was an enjoyable romantasy.  

The characters are fun- **Alaris** is spunky and **Kagan** has just enough blind loyalty to his Emperor, fellow soldiers and his beliefs to allow us to question his motives throughout. I’m a die-hard enemy to lovers’ fan so I appreciated the possibility of it not working out between him and Alairis even while expecting it to. (Also, tbh I am never quite sure when I read a romantasy if hea applies in the sub-genre?)

 I have always preferred to have pov’s from each of the leads in a romance, so I was quite happy to spend time with both Alaris and Kagan and it was nice to see their world through their eyes; especially being of such completely different social classes.

I also really enjoy a bad guy I can hate, so props to the villain for being suitably villain-y. Though I did have a pause at him giving away the one thing that could give him more of what he wanted.

One thing I really thought was fun in **Temper the Dark**, and enjoyed a lot - was the problems associated with Alaris’s gift. I liked how it had to be dealt with in some of the most inconvenient times. It’s always nice to see things not always be at an optimum level when dealing with magical abilities.

**Temper the Dark's** story grew very nicely; the world, the characters, the magic, the romance, each little piece filled things out expanding the plot and our understanding of the world they live in.

Occasionally things did feel on the easy-side; Alaris coming across her sister comes to mind, and that last-inning save for the one character… but hey, I’m all about the HEA so I’m not going to complain too much on that score if it gets me a nice finish.

I want a fantasy video game,"I mean a game like what you see in stuff like Bofuri: I don’t want to get hurt, so I’ll max out my defense or Sword Art Online.

Obviously we can’t replicate the whole VR experience but it’s frustrating to not have a game like that specifically. Preferably where you can make your own character. Just a game where you level, get new skills and gear and just have fun in a high fantasy world, instead of something like Genshin Impact where it’s just reliant on luck if you get better gear and you have to roll for new characters.

If anyone knows games like that please let me know 🙏",fantasy
Understanding LitRPG: What is it? Why do people read it?," 

With Dungeon Crawler Carl slated for a television adaptation, a lot of people are curious about LitRPG. Whether it’s the first time you’re hearing about the genre or if you were aware of it but just a little unsure, I’m here to break it down for you.

**In short: LitRPG is speculative fiction that utilizes gamelike mechanics or elements to build a world or magic system.**

Many people assume LitRPG books are more like the old “Choose Your Own Adventure” books, but they’re not. If you’re looking for something like that, you don’t want LitRPG, you want a type of video game called a “Visual Novel.”

**But what does it mean to include gamelike elements if the book is just a book?**

Another way of putting this is to say that LitRPG books have a *super* rigid magic system. For people who are familiar with [Brandon Sanderson’s Laws of Magic](https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/knowledge-base/what-are-sandersons-laws-of-magic/), you’ll immediately see how this opens up a lot of space for interesting storytelling.

There are lots of ways these gamelike elements can be expressed. Some examples:

* Characters could be trapped in a literal video game, sort of like in the movie Jumanji or in the anime Sword Art Online. This has fallen a bit out of style in the past couple years, but it’s still part of the genre (subgenre: VRMMO. Example series: Forever Fantasy Online by Rachel Aaron and Travis Bach, Disgardium by Dan Sugralinov)
* A gamelike system descends on the world. Sometimes aliens are using humanity for sick entertainment, as in Matt Dinniman’s Dungeon Crawler Carl. Sometimes the system is meant as a test of some kind. Sometimes the wave of magic isn’t something that could be stopped, but the system was created to help humanity adapt as it hits, as in Alex Kozlowski’s Alpha Physics. (subgenre: Gamesystem Apocalypse, often simply referred to as system apocalypse.)
* A person is transported to a world in which different, gamelike rules have always applied. (subgenre: isekai/portal fantasy. Example series: Beneath the Dragoneye Moons by Selkie Myth, The Wandering Inn by Pirateaba)
* The story takes place in an alternate world that has *always* had gamelike rules/a rigid magic system. I don’t know that this subgenre actually has a name, but This Trilogy is Broken by J.P. Valentine and Titan Hoppers by Rob J. Hayes are good examples.

That’s hardly an exhaustive list, but it gives you some idea of the flexibility.

**Okay, so that’s what it is. Why is it so popular? Would I like it?**

I mean, at its core, it’s just more speculative fiction! Just another flavor of fantasy or sci-fi. It’s not that scary, so the easiest way of finding out if you like it is giving it a try. That said, it does have a few selling points.

**As a genre, LitRPG prioritizes fun.**

Don’t get me wrong! There’s plenty of drama, horror, terror, and grief.

There just aren’t a lot of pretensions. No one’s trying to write the literary masterpieces, they’re trying to write stories that will appeal to the masses, gripping adventures that are easy to sink into and use as an escape from everyday life.

 As the great C.S. Lewis said “When I became a man, I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness.” Authors here aren’t scared to pursue just about any premise that catches their imagination, and readers aren’t scared to give something weird a try. Which brings me to my next point…

**Self-publication is the norm, so authors don’t have to write things the market is already demanding**

I won’t lie, self-publication has upsides and downsides. The standard of editing in the genre *is* lower than traditional fantasy. That’s not to say that the best titles aren’t just as well-edited as any traditionally published book, but other titles… aren’t.

Why do readers put up with this? That’s easy!

Authors don’t have to write to market. They can write whatever their crazy little brains dream up. Some examples from books I’ve read and enjoyed:

* Man has to fight for his life by the side of his girlfriend’s cat, who recently gained sapience (Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman)
* Man with the power to return to a self-made save point is determined to save a friend. Unfortunately, the city she’s in is about to be destroyed in about five different ways. (The Perfect Run by Maxime J. Durand)
* Woman was just trying to work a hot dog stand when the whole area is sucked into another, extremely lethal, dimension. Good thing someone replaced her eye with a crystal that’s giving her advice and guidance. (Whispering Crystals by HC Mills)
* Magic and monsters have swept across the world, leaving one long-haul trucker stranded as her beloved big rig breaks down. How can she leave Bertha? Maybe, if she pursues the right magic, she doesn’t have to. (Battle Trucker by Tom Goldstein – warning: *lots* of swearing)
* Stuffed teddy bear golem gained sapience, but no one realizes. Can it survive the magically terrible luck that accompanied its birth without help? (Threadbare by Andrew Seiple)
* Man is reincarnated in the body of a female ant monster, and takes to it with gusto. (Chrysalis by RinoZ)
* Old lady who doesn’t understand games becomes the guiding intelligence for a magical monster lair. (Cat Core by Dean Henegar and Gianpiero Mangialardi)

And those are just a small sampling of a few of the books where I can sum up the weirdness in a short, non-spoilery blurb! There are dozens more titles with storylines and settings that are just as strange and unexpected.

One thing I should add is that **many of the books in this genre were first published serially**, the digital heirs to a longstanding tradition. Yeah, we had a while where serially-published works were unusual, but **serial publication brought the world many of literature’s past greats**. Serial publication brought the public everything from Count of Monte Christo and Sherlock Holmes, to the works of Charles Dickens, to early science fiction like Dune and and The Time Machine. It’s been out of style for several decades, but it’s back, baby! *However*, it does lead to a certain pace that some readers don’t enjoy, so if you’re interested in LitRPG but already know serials aren’t your thing, you might consider the works of J.R. Mathews, Forever Fantasy Online by Rachel Aaron and Travis Bach, or Travis Bagwell’s Awaken Online.

**Finally… odds are that you enjoy videogames.** Have you *really* never thought to yourself, “Wouldn’t it be crazy if life really worked like that?” Have you never wanted to see the stories of your mental what-ifs played out?

If not, this might not be the genre for you… but for us, it’s fabulous!",fantasy
Searching for a perfect fantasy series,"Hey there!

I wondered if there is a fantasy series that perfectly matches my tastes, thus I decided to ask for you help!

1. It should be a high fantasy with a deep worldbuilding and rich magic. I like when magic is utilized in all aspects of life and has rules, like in ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". Magic in there is simple in its core but is used creatively and in very different ways in different cultures. Another example of such worldbuilding would be Fullmetal Alchemist. I've already tried Sanderson, but I didn't like his character work and prose.
2. The world, the magic, all the cultures should be meticulously planned, but the characters should drive the story, not the other way around. I like deep character study of Robin Hobb and duel of wits of dialogues of George Martin.
3. I want the tone to be hopeful or at least not full of misery. I've had enough of Fitz's torture throughout multiple books, thank you very much. But also I don't want it to be too hopeful, it still should be somehow serious and with some dark themes sprinkled here and there.
4. The prose should be of high quality. My favorite is Patrick Rothfuss. I also adore how simple yet on point is George Martin's style.
5. There should be a balance of magic action, simple action, adventure, dialogues and gut-wrenching drama.

What have I tried already?

The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss - the best prose I've encountered in English-written modern books, good worldbuilding but lack of characterization for anyone but Kvothe. Also I hate Denna and the sex fairy parts. Also, I believe the third book is something like a half life 3 at this point. My favorite part was Kvothe's suffering in Tarbean and his life in the university.

The Realm of Elderlings by Robin Hobb - the best character work I've ever read, especially deep dive into Fitz's emotions. But... it's so depressing when the MC and all other good people get screwed again and again and again. Also I prefer when the society and the world is more developed, with some trains, infrastructure, etc. but not too modern (without digital).

ASOIAF by George Martin - I've watched the show and started reading the books. The dialogues are PERFECT, the prose is simple but fits so good with the world it seems like it was written by someone from the world itself.

Gentleman Bastard by Scott Lynch - DNF. Seems I didn't like the themes at all.

Dresden Files by Jim Butcher - liked the first book, but didn't want to continue, because it felt too modern and noir-ish.

Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski - I hated it. I hated so much that Sapkowski created an interesting world with interesting characters but decided to tell completely irrelevant story leaving all the interesting things out of his books. Battle of Sodden? Mentioned like a small news article. The fall of Aretuza? Some witch just tells what happened like a sport commentator. Ciri in Camelot? No, just watch these two witches talk about their dreams and sex with fisherman king. GREAT.

Six of Crows - I liked it! It has diverse set of characters with cool talents and clashing personalities with action and suspense set in the world full of both magic and somewhat developed weaponry. What I didn't like is that characters were too young. I alway pretended they were all just older. Another pet peeve is that characters felt too OP, like some avengers.

Sanderson - tried Mistborn and Stormlight, couldn't stand the RPG feel to everything happening. It seemed to me as I was reading a report of what was happening without actually diving into the minds of the characters. Also, the magic and action seemed too mechanical.

Abercrombie - bad people doing questionable things in worlds with almost no magic. I liked the witty writing, but after a while it became too much. I prefer something more sincere, something taking itself more seriously.

Will Wight - too RPG, too much focus on magic and becoming stronger. I prefer when the magic exists, but the story is about characters and their drama, not the magic itself.

What I want to try next?

Wheel of Time - I liked the magic system in the TV series, but the size of the series frightens me. Also, it seems like Jordan's writing is a bit meandering from the bits I've read.

Malazan - I am just afraid to start it because I am not a native speaker and the writing itself is hard to process at time... but Malazan is complex and intertwined even not considering my bad English, so, yeah. Wanna try but afraid to get stuck.

  
EDIT: thanks to everyone! I wanna try Wheel of Time but will read other books (the empire trilogy, the curse of chalion, divine cities, shadows of the apt) between WOT books.",fantasy
Coolest weapons/powers in Fantasy?,"What's everyone's favourite weapons/powers from any fantasy/sci-fi/sci-fantasy? I love the Razor from Red Rising. It's a sword than can change its shape based on the user. I love how certain characters use them differently (eg Darrow usually has his Razor in the shape of a sling-blade(scythe) Lysander has a slight crescent in his in honour of his house, Sevro's has a serrated edge etc etc ) It can go from ridged to whip-like with the press of a button, harder than diamonds and can penetrate most armours. Comes in different colours (eg Aja has a opal-ish multi-coloured Razor which is dope af imo) Such a bad ass weapon.",fantasy
How do you feel about philosophy in fantasy?,"Do you prefer your novels straightforward (Belgariad, Memory Sorrow and Thorn, Shannara, Kingkiller Chronicles ) or rich in philosophy and long monologues (Malazan, Second Apocalypse, Book of the New Sun)?",fantasy

&gt; The summer had finally reached our island. We shed layers of knitted wool and sinew-sewn fur and let the wind move across our bare arms and legs — a vulnerable feeling after being perpetually covered for most of the year. Fishermen were out at all hours of the day or night. With the darkness only covering two hours in twenty-four, there was little need to stop; our people moved with the strange rhythms of the far north. From the tundra at the top of the world to the jungles in the south, this is where we had gathered. If anyone were to visit long enough, they’d notice we were different.

&gt; But no one ever stayed that long. Not unless they were one of us.

**[A Lullaby of Anguish](https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/a-lullaby-of-anguish/)** by Marie Croke (6400 words)

&gt; We used to cage them in the tide pools, when they were still small enough to capture in our little hands. Pull them out and snap photos that we could pretend to sell to magazines just like Papa. Them, gasping for breath, unable to see, fins fluttering. We would photograph until they began to loosen, go limp. And then we would dunk them again, let them freshen up. Try again.

During that session, we will also announce our slate for **October 18**.

Best Sci-Fi Fantasy novels with a sort of Ancient Retrofuturistic/Technology combined with Nature theme?,"So this is abit of an odd request for suggestions, but in the late 90s there was a really strange Point &amp; Click Adventure game called Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen (it aimed to reimagine the Richard Wagner Opera Drama Der Ring des Nibelungen as Sci-Fi, which was loosely based on Germanic Norse Mythology)


The game is honestly pretty terrible, but I loved the weird aesthetic of surreal &amp; dark Epic Fantasy with Ancient-feeling visuals and imagery of organic nature, combined with the themes &amp; aesthetic of Sci-Fi, Space, &amp; Technology.


Another few odd examples of this could be the Turok games, Final Fantasy 7, etc.

Finished Dragonlance; any other fantasy series?,"Hey all. I have recently finished Dragonlance Destinies (really enjoyed it btw) and grew up on Chronicles and Legends but just wondered what other fantasy series you’d all recommend?
I love the world of Krynn and the variety of characters, races, monsters, and the DnD style quest that our heroes go on. I haven’t yet managed to find anything that quite hits the same mark as Dragonlance. So thought I’d ask on here. Thanks in advance. ",fantasy
The Witcher series… ,"I have recently read Blood of Elves. Really it’s everything I like about The Witcher, although I’m not dying to pick up the next book. I feel like it’s kind of been repetitive so far, although I do really like what is being repeated.

Of course, a massive battle is being foreshadowed but I’m just not sure how the story is actually going to evolve and how the characters are going to develop. Apart from Ciri I haven’t really seen much progression in terms of the characters. Unless I am missing something, I may be wrong?

Question about John Gwynne's Faithful and the Fallen.,"Hiya book nerds, I have a General question about Faithful and the Fallen, I recently started reading the series, currently most of the way through Ruin.

Authors intentions and results,"Inspired by post about unlikable protagonists- do you have any books where authors intentions clearly didn't match the outcome?

There Exist Excellent Romantasy Books...,"...you just have to know where to look!

Like a lot of other people, I sometimes get frustrated with the lack of curiosity and overabundance of disdain towards romantasy/romantic fantasy/fanrom in this sub. I think we all know that the most popular books are not always the *best* of the genre (not that popular books can't have their own merits, but googling ""fantasy books"" isn't a guarantee to find your new favorite). So I wanted to recommend a few romantasy novels I've really enjoyed, from the perspective of someone who mostly reads fantasy. These are more recent, as I've also noticed people tend to default to older books for romantasy recs - which is great, but sometimes harder to find in my experience. 

*One Dark Window* by Rachel Gillig: Not necessarily doing anything new, but it has great atmosphere and court politics, and everything it does, it does very well

*A Marvelous Light* by Freya Marske: Looser on plot than some of the others on this list, but genuinely charming adult fantasy romance with an interesting magic system

*Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Fairies* by Heather Fawcett: Even my partner, who primarily reads grimdark and epic fantasy, really enjoyed this book. Horror, romance, footnotes, and a more ""folkloric"" take on fae

*The Cruel Prince* by Holly Black: I'm pretty sure every book described as ""enemies to lovers"" is trying to take a bite of what Holly Black already cooked. Not a true ""romantasy"" as the romance is a side plot, but really, really memorable

*Silver Under Nightfall* by Rin Chupeco: Not my personal favorite but campy fun vampires. Come for the romance, stay for the melodramatic gothic vibes",fantasy

What's your favorite role for a POV?,"This is a very broad question, but the general idea is: what positions within society do you feel are fun to explore from the main character's perspective? Personally, I feel like an underrated role is that of the chronicler. Think Croaker from the Black Company or Holsten from Children of Time. Seeing the world through the eyes of someone so concerned with its past adds an extra dimension to the worldbuilding, and allows the writer to throw in some extra lore.",fantasy
Series similar to Inheritance Cycle,I know a lot of you don't like Eragon but it my favourite series and I was hoping some of you could help me find more like it. I'd prefer no romance but if it's just in the background or very minor/skippable I can power through it lol,fantasy
What is your best example of a “mixed bag” book?,"The headline pretty much sums it up; what is a book that has a mixture of excellence and….not? 
I was thinking this when I decided to reread KKC after several years. I thought he does an excellent job with prose, characterization (I might be using this word wrong, but I feel like you can create a very vivid image and understanding of his characters even with relatively few pages), survivalism (in book 1), world-building, and mystery. He is pretty awful at plot, particularly book 2, character development, writing women, and it remains to be seen if he can accomplish a good reveal of the mystery which is 10 x harder than the set-up. So what are your best examples of mixed bag books or series and would you recommend them despite their flaws?",fantasy
"The Impossible Recommendation of Elric of Melniboné (or, The Perils of Pulp)","Ever read a series where you felt you may have been better off reading a summary?

For all of the grand (some of the grandest) ideas in the stories of **Elric of Melniboné**, I did not feel that it was ultimately a great reading experience. In some ways **Michael Moorcock** has a command of grand romantic language and certainly has the concept of how to create an epic narrative. Yet he is shackled by the expectations of **pulp fiction** and a seeming **lack of reliance** in his readers to connect the dots. I find it incredibly difficult to recommend Elric's story as a modern epic fantasy reader.

Defining **""pulp""** fantasy may help illuminate some of my disconnect. Many simplifications of pulp fiction create value judgments, whether it's about the paper stock or the quality of writing. Of course any fan of the form knows that it's incredibly **diverse**, but they do possess a form defined by how they were published: **Serialized stories using repeated motifs often written to a very tight schedule.** The authors who tried to ascend above the baseline of the form like **Burroughs**, **Chandler**, and **Lovecraft** worked to give their works literary qualities and continuity, but they were always restricted by the form.

What I would define as the core of pulp fantasy is thus: **The concept of the story is more important than its narrative.**

Liking this form of fiction is entirely valid. Getting wrapped up in tales that don't adhere to defined **literary standards** because it grips your mind in a way nothing else ever has can be a defining experience for many readers. Moorcock himself has a famous quote in regards to this,

&gt;I think of myself as a bad writer with big ideas, but I'd rather be that than a big writer with bad ideas. -Michael Moorcock

Of course this is self-deprecation - a favored trait of authors. Undoubtedly there are a lot of people who do **not** think Moorcock is a bad writer - indeed he's one of the most **inspirational** fantasy authors in history. People don't tend to latch onto things they fundamentally dislike.

However, while remaining even into his older years a pulp writer, the Elric ""Saga"" (as it was recently packaged in the form I read it) attempts to bridge the gap between pulp and Tolkien-infused **epic fantasy**. This is where the forms clash in **incompatible** ways, undermining the grand tale of Elric through adherence to pulp expectations.

&gt;For this was the other thing that Elric knew: that to compromise with Tyranny is always to be destroyed by it. The sanest and most logical choice lay always in resistance.

One of the things Elric is most famous for is his **philosophical introspections** and general moody demeanor. This particular side of the hero made him very popular in Japan, influencing games like *Final Fantasy* and several fantasy mangaka. In the actual stories though, these introspective moments are always **derailed** by the plot. What should be setting up an arc for the story to explore becomes subsumed by totally unrelated events.

This is why I feel Elric works better in **abstract** than on paper. The actual events that drive the story tend to be totally unrelated villain/monster fights which *happen* to resolve the narrative. Some of those fights can have interesting moments, yet never much **emotional depth**. Every thing that Elric **loses** along the way feels hollow because it's not integrated into the story - merely introduced. This extends to the very loose **magic** which sits uncomfortably in deus ex machina territory.

&gt;""As you know, sorcerer, the Lords of Law and Chaos are usually in perfect balance, neither tampering directly with our earth. Evidently the Balance has tipped a little way to one side, as it sometimes does, favouring the Lords of Disorder—allowing them access to our realm.""

Moorcock is totally unwilling to get out of his own way in world building. If an element of the world needs to be understood, it will be explained, **verbatim** - almost always by Elric - and rarely weaved into the storytelling through description or example. It's cool fantasy stuff, brought to you in the **driest** way possible. In the worst instances, like in reference to the power of **Stormbringer**, it's endlessly restated because they can't expect readers to have remembered the **previous stories** - another limitation of the pulp format. I was never able to get into the narrative because they were constantly underselling themselves.

None of this is to say that Moorcock can't write powerfully. There are scenes I'll remember, characters I had a fun time with, and a few lurid descriptions that showcase his talent. Indeed there are some great literary quotes which, when taken out of context, seem very powerful - they're just surrounded with mediocre or daft plotting.

&gt;“You spend your lives chasing that which is within you and that which you can find in any other human being - but you will not look for it there - you must follow more glamorous paths - to waste your time in order to discover that you have wasted your time.”

A few things I disliked, in abstract: Elric's supposedly difficult moral questions are always rendered moot when it turns out the other side are acting on behalf of all-killing **demons**. One recurring villain gets replaced with another that acts **identically** - only never poses a threat. In one of the later books, perhaps the most interesting discussion of Elric's nature gets sidelined for a multi-dimensional **fetch quest**. Even the **emotional climax** of the series - which genuinely surprised me - features an unnecessary interruption.

There's one other huge issue with the stories: The **reading order**. *The Elric Saga* (two volumes) packages eight of the stories together in a chronological order which, in my opinion, undersells the world even more. It's complicated to get into without spoilers. Even though I consider the eponymous *Elric of Melniboné* to be the **best** overall story and a good introduction, I **would not** recommend reading it this way. Read the three original collections: *The Weird of the White Wolf*, *The Bane of the Black Sword*, and *Stormbringer* before any other story. This order preserves, as best it can, the mystery of the world and the underlying epic. All the later novels (that I read) **spoil** one element or other.

The Elric series has been a frustrating read for me, grasping at **greatness** while consistently fumbling any sense of greater immersion. But I do feel I got something **valuable** out of the delve: **A better sense of what I value in stories.** I realize that I cannot consider a book great with a thread bare plot; concepts are not enough for me. My imagination is not active enough to fill in the gaps, but I think readers that love that sort of storytelling will absolutely **adore** Elric and its many ideas which resonate today about as much as they did in the early 1960s.

Moorcock is undoubtedly a **legend** - none of my criticisms detract from that. Talk about your experiences with his writing and the Elric series! I'd love to see what people think of it in the modern day.",fantasy
Books where the Fmc becomes insane bc of her powers,"Hiii,

Thoughts on reading novels with a main character that you dislike or find annoying?,"I'm currently halfway through listening to An Academy For Liars by Alexis Henderson, and it got me thinking about reading/listening to books with a main character that you find personally unlikable.  I'm curious about how others feel about this?

I find that it's harder for me to fully engage with the book, especially as it goes on.  I get irritated with the character and eventually find myself rooting for something else to go wrong for them (especially if it's yet another direct result of their own crappy actions).

I absolutely can appreciate the value of getting into the headspace of someone you don't agree with and learning to see things from their side.  I love books that can gradually lead you to realize, even if you don't agree with, why a villain would take the actions that they did, show the dual sides of a story, etc.

But for example, the main character of An Academy For Liars (Lennon) is, to me, a character I am having absolutely no luck sympathizing with.  She is spoiled, has a victim ""poor me"" mentality, admits to liking to make people worry about her and make people mad at her, and acts like a bratty teenager despite being in her low twenties (I can't remember her exact age).

Her own sister said it best imo, though I'm paraphrasing since I don't have the exact quote from my audiobook: ""You cause your own problems, then make them everyone else's problems.""

Mild (moderate maybe) spoilers to follow, but I'll tag them.  She again and again chooses to stay in shitty situations of her own volition and/or making (&gt;!dates shitty guys, is surprised when they're shitty to her; is morally against and hates doing the one thing her new magical academy exists to teach, fights to stay there anyway and is shocked pikachu when she's not very good at it!&lt;) and yet there is never any self-reflection at all and it's all pity parties and ""poor me"" when the obvious happens.

It's clear her morality (which she brings up often, and uses it many times to critique the morality of the academy) is convenience-based.  &gt;!She's against using Persuasion magic to essentially remove the free will of the lab mice and the school using it to influence the minds of the public (which, totally fair) but does it quickly enough when her rightfully concerned family asks her about her secret school, or tries to keep her from going back to what looks from the outside like a suspicious, weird sex trafficking thing.  In fact, she rips the whole memory, holds them in stasis, and LITERALLY REARRANGES THEIR FACES WITH HER FINGERS from concerned and worried to happy.!&lt;  She's perfectly happy to criticize on a morality basis but happily does it anyway when she's angry and wants her own way.

Probably one of the most annoying things to me is that her entire personality and actions seem based around causing drama, getting any attention at all from others (positive or negative), and is blithely accepting of the fact that she's cool with her blatantly narcissistic behavior of being willing to cause the people who care for her any amount of emotional and mental distress because she likes knowing they're focused on her, or because she wants something.  But my absolute favorite part is when &gt;!she blackmails the mentor/teacher into taking her back as a mentee, after he tried to assign her to someone else to distance them because people were beginning to talk and A TEACHER SHOULDN'T BE SLEEPING WITH A STUDENT.  Dude's job could literally be at stake, but she happily throws a temper tantrum, ruins his Christmas, and forces him to take her back as a mentee or she won't return to the school (which, again, could possibly put his job at risk if she didn't).!&lt;

Sorry, I kind of got off topic and this turned into a bit of a ""why I personally hate Lennon and hope she either finally hits puberty and matures before age 30 and apologizes to all the people she's royally fucked, or something super bad happens to her"" post.  At this point, I'm having trouble fully engaging with it over my irritation and am just hanging on to see whether she gets a redemption arc or well-deserved comeuppance.

How do you guys deal with/feel about books with characters you don't like?  Are you able to engage with the book on the same level as others?  Is there a difference to you between books where it seems like the author is trying intentionally to create an unlikable main character (A Confederacy of Dunces) or seems like they're trying to make a likeable, relatable, or empathize-able main character but falls completely short of the mark for you?

Edit: Just to clarify, I don't mean ""likeable or unlikeable"" to mean ""moral or immoral,"" as a character definitely doesn't have to be moral for me to like them.  I'm more referring to character traits and a lack of any redeeming qualities.",fantasy
book recs for post revolution fantasy,looking for a book rec that takes place after a revolution and the rebuilding or restructuring of a society afterwards. a major plus if it heavily explores themes of decolonization. recently read the aurelian cycle and really loved how it was kind of a change of pace from the usual where we see the build up of a revolution in a lot of stories. thank you!,fantasy
Best fantasy series without caveats?,"I'm currently reading the lightbringer series by brent weeks (please no spoilers for that) and while I'm enjoying it a lot. People keep telling me the ending sucks. Maybe I'm just a little ocd with this stuff but it really surprises me how many glowing recommendations people will give to a fantsy series, but then add on something like ""Oh but the ending is terrible."" Or ""Well but the middle six books are a slog (wheel of time)"".

Are there any fantasy series you would consider amazing that don't have some giant flaw? I mean lord of the rings is an obvious example where there isn't anything specifically I think people point at as overtly negative.

I'll include my goodreads shelf in case anyone is wondering what I have already read.

[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/155975200?shelf=read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/155975200?shelf=read)

UPDATE: 

Thanks for the ideas everyone! Just to clarify, when I said caveats, I meant major narrative or structural hurdles in the series. Like how a song of ice and fire will likely never be completed, or how wheel of time is 14 books long and has some books which are allegedly a giant chore to read. I didn't mean no book series is perfect, it just seemed to me like a lot of the most popular ones came with giant asterisks on them.

A WWI Ghost Story: A Review of The Warm Hands of Ghosts by Katherine Arden," *This review can also be found* [*on my blog*](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/09/24/historical-fantasy-novel-review-the-warm-hands-of-ghosts-by-katherine-arden/)*.* 

I’d heard a decent amount of praise for Katherine Arden’s *Winternight Trilogy*, but the TBR is too long to read everything that’s praised, and she dropped far enough off my radar that I barely noticed when *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* released earlier this year. But I’d seen people calling it their favorite book of the year and praising the character work and portrayal of familial relationships with death and tragedy all around, which was plenty to get my attention and add it to my list. 

*The Warm Hands of Ghosts* follows a Canadian brother and sister in World War I. Laura had worked as a nurse before being sent home after an injury in a hospital bombing, with Freddie lost and presumed dead in the trenches. But when Laura gets word suggesting Freddie may still be alive, she immediately looks for a way to get back across the Atlantic to track him down; meanwhile, Freddie is both fighting to stay alive in a literal war zone and fighting the despair that could see him give up on the first battle entirely. 

I’m not usually a huge fan of military fiction, but *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* contains almost no actual combat scenes, focusing instead on the psychological fallout of witnessing horrors on an enormous scale and losing friends and family. Stories about characters working through psychologically taxing situations are much more my speed, and *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* truly delivered. 

At the start of the book, Laura is safely back in Canada, barely holding herself together after losing three family members in quick succession. Freddie is missing, and the only speculative elements on the table are the early 20th century fashion for seances. But it isn’t long before we begin to see chapters from Freddie’s perspective, and the reports of interactions with ghosts start getting harder to deny, opening into a true dual-perspective narrative whose speculative and non-speculative elements progress in tandem. Both leads have witnessed horrors and have the psychological scars to prove it, and the natural horrors dovetail perfectly with a ghost story that borrows more than a few tropes from Fae tales, focusing heavily on memory, whether memory preserved or memory given up. 

While Laura’s story has a bit more complexity than Freddie’s, I found the latter to be on the whole more powerful. Don’t get me wrong, I like both a lot, but Freddie’s tale has a psychological rawness that makes it hard to look away, as he clings to one goal as singular motivation to stay alive, battling feelings of despair and worthlessness and the temptation to take the easy way out. It’s a mental slog that doesn’t admit of quick fixes, but it remains gripping to the reader even as the character wanders well-trod patterns. 

Laura can take a more active role in the plot, with a clear goal and the skills to serve those around her while waiting for information and the opportunity to act on it. But even so, she fights many of the same battles as Freddie, having herself been injured in her previous tour, having herself lost family, and being directly confronted with the callousness of those running the war. While she may be more focused and mentally whole, she still feels the full weight of a slow-moving tragedy that feels to those on the ground like the end of the world, and the echo of Freddie’s battles in Laura’s arc serves only to strengthen the thematic depth. 

If I have any complaint here, it’s in the romantic subplots, particularly the speed at which they move. It’s not at all surprising to see characters deeply attached to co-laborers in such an emotionally intense setting, but *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* speeds too quickly to the end, leaving the romantic elements feeling rushed and underdeveloped. 

But the romance is a minor subplot, and if it moves too quickly, it takes away little from a novel that is truly my favorite of the year so far. *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* is heavy yet easy to read, with both main character arcs combining wonderfully with both the historical setting and the supernatural elements to deliver a tale with oceans of psychological depth and an intense weightiness of living through manmade tragedy and despairing to find life again on the other side. It’s truly an excellent read, and one I highly recommend. 

*Recommended if you like:* war stories that aren’t combat heavy, fighting through psychological trauma. 

*Can I use it for* [*Bingo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bt4iqf/official_rfantasy_2024_book_bingo_challenge/)*?* It’s hard mode for Character with a Disability and for Survival, and it’s also Published in 2024 and features Dreams, Bards, and Reference Materials. 

*Overall rating:* 18 of Tar Vol’s 20. Five stars on Goodreads.

#Blurb (book one)

*Nahri has never believed in magic. Certainly, she has power; on the streets of 18th century Cairo, she’s a con woman of unsurpassed talent. But she knows better than anyone that the trade she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, healings—are all tricks, sleights of hand, learned skills; a means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles.*

*But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass, a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound.* 

*In that city, behind gilded brass walls laced with enchantments, behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments are simmering. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, she learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics. That even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly consequences.*

*After all, there is a reason they say be careful what you wish for...*

#Review

If I misspell names it‘s because I listened to the audiobook and couldn’t find the spelling online easily. Can definitely recommend the audio version, it‘s narrated by Soneela Nankani, who does an excellent job imo.

* I don’t even know where to start. I loved this trilogy. It scratched almost every itch I have for the books I read and did so many things so fucking well
* I think what I loved most about this series is how fucking juicy all of the interpersonal relationships are, and how much they change over the course of the series, from cautious alliances to friendships to romantic entanglements that nobody has time for because there‘s centuries of oppression and hatred to address  first 
* The city of Daevabad and the entire Djinn world, manages to feel magical and somewhat grounded at once. There‘s magic that dominates life, but also a lot of very realistic human error, prejudice, beliefs, complications… it just all worked really well for me   
* I loved that this series takes the concept of djinn who have to grant wishes to humans and then goes into the actual horror of that kind of enslavement  
* That the world is Arabic-inspired and uses both Djinn myths as well as Islamic traditions felt super fresh to me. I also liked the role of Cairo/Egypt as Nahri‘s home and occasional analogy for a repeatedly conquered land, even though not *that* much of the story actually takes place there
* I recently saw people on here complain about Ali‘s PoV chapters in book 1 as a DNF reason and honestly I definitely liked Nahri‘s story and viewpoint a LOT more early on, but Ali grew on me really quickly, especially once their story strands meet, still relatively early in book 1
* I loved the focus on healing magic and medicine, Nahri learning to master her powers but also how to employ human medicines and methods
* I fell in love with several of the main characters and had my heart broken at various points as a result
* Over the course of the series, (though perhaps most noticeable in book 2?) there are a significant amount of layered mysteries that slowly unravel, with some hints being dropped to the reader long before the MCs themselves catch up, and I found that *incredibly* satisfying   
* There's no true good or evil in this book, many of the sympathetic characters have huge moral failings, and about every antagonist gets humanized without being excused. I find it a great example of morality being shades of grey without everything becoming a grimdark murk.

#Discussion

* The way book 1 makes you fall in love with &gt;!Dara!&lt; and then lets him go off the fucking deep end over much of book two and three was heartbreaking. I kept &gt;!waiting for him to snap, to finally put his foot down and oppose Manizeh, only for it to backfire in the worst ways when he tries!&lt;. I love that the series manages to make hom a sympathetic character &gt;!deeply betrayed by what he most believed in!&lt;, while not &gt;!excusing any of his various war crimes!&lt; 
* I considered calling this a &gt;!“love triangle done right""!&lt; in the top section but I think even that would conjure up the wrong image. Still, I adored how Nahri‘s &gt;!feelings for Dara and Ali are explored in depth, but never compared, her main conflict is never „oh no whomever will I end up with“ because homegirl has vastly more important shit to figure out!&lt;. The kind of romance that only *barely* finds space between the bigger problems is my favorite, and this series did that incredibly well
* They only make up a side arc, but I loved the queer angst of &gt;!Jamshid and Munthadir, their concern for each other, Nahri‘s absolute nonchalance at her husband‘s affair(s)!&lt;
* Honestly, all of &gt;!Nahri‘s relationships with the male main characters around her!&lt; are fucking precious to me, from the immediate fascination and &gt;!a bit of reckless passion during the initial journey with Dara!&lt; to the tentative friendship, &gt;!repeated disappointments and eventual slow burn attraction to Ali!&lt;, to the &gt;!initial enmity and then mutual respect and care with Muntadir ending in their much-celebrated divorce!&lt;, all of those arcs just work *so well*, all while never being what defines Nahri as a character.
* My review notes are useless because for the majority of book three I just wrote down „thing that happens“ with various crying and heartbreak emojis. There‘s just so many layers of reveals and twists and developments that I utterly adored

&gt;  
&gt;In the lands of Bethel, where the Prophet’s word is law, Immanuelle Moore’s very existence is blasphemy. Her mother’s union with an outsider of a different race cast her once-proud family into disgrace, so Immanuelle does her best to worship the Father, follow Holy Protocol, and lead a life of submission, devotion, and absolute conformity, like all the other women in the settlement.  
&gt;  
&gt;But a mishap lures her into the forbidden Darkwood surrounding Bethel, where the first prophet once chased and killed four powerful witches. Their spirits are still lurking there, and they bestow a gift on Immanuelle: the journal of her dead mother, who Immanuelle is shocked to learn once sought sanctuary in the wood.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fascinated by the secrets in the diary, Immanuelle finds herself struggling to understand how her mother could have consorted with the witches. But when she begins to learn grim truths about the Church and its history, she realizes the true threat to Bethel is its own darkness.

Struggling with The Failures by Benjamin Liar.,"My bad, I know. Believed the hype and paid the price I think. I rarely buy books from new writers when they come out because it's a lot of money and you're always taking a chance. But this one had rave reviews from writers I like, so I bought it and now I'm regretting it.

It's a slog and the characters are so immature and just say fuck this, fuck that in basically every sentence. I'm about 200 pages into the book and I've been considering DNFing it every time I get to the end of a chapter.

Maybe it's not for me and that's cool. But for those of you who have read it, when does it get good? Nothing really happens and the characters are just annoying and pretty dumb to boot.

Afraid to read reviews and getting spoiled. Should I keep going and make it to the good stuff? Or is this another case of don't believe the hype?",fantasy

"The First Law trilogy - didn't get the hype, not sure which fantasy book to read next. [Spoilers for the original trilogy]","I'm trying to get back into fantasy, and this was the first Fantasy series I read after a decade. Through this reddit, I decided to pick this one up to satisfy the ASOIAF itch, but didn't love it, and have put them down to discussion at the end of the post.

I'm now wondering if I should continue with it, or maybe **try Malazan/Black company? Or something else?** I've read Inheritance, Harry Potter, ASOIAF+all companion books, and LOTR+Hobbit in core adventure fantasy. Apart from this, I've also read a bit of sci-fi and lots of YA. I liked all of these books, but I was a younger reader then, too.

In general, there are some things I like: Less of padding &amp; descriptive fluff (quick plot development), Magic/Dragons, some lore &amp; worldbuilding along the way, Gary-sueish characters/not having popular tropes. I'm okay with not all of these being met, however. Would be happy to take in suggestions from you guys :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Issues which made me not 'love' the first law trilogy (Guys - before anything, I know, I know about how the book tries to deconstruct a lot of Fantasy tropes. I know I've to be realistic about such things).

1. Lack of plot development in book 1: The first book was just an extended introduction of characters, and the setup of the ""Quest"". I found myself skimming through a lot - though i did enjoy all of Glokta's chapters, I just couldn't see the significance of Ninefingers &amp; Bayaz, of Ferro, and some others in relation to how the plot was panning out. The plot simply didn't move ahead enough, unfortunately. If the idea is that the books were to be read as a single book with 3 volumes, then I feel the book could have been trimmed down a lot. I like books which develop a bit quicker than this, maybe.
2. The Northmen: I found myself skipping pages sometimes - a lot of what happens to the Dogman, Black Dow etc. as they make their way the North seemed repetitive - they run into soldiers loyal to Bethod, Shanka, etc., and defeat them repeatedly against difficult odds (they do take losses, iirc). But all of the characters seemed similar to me until the third book, and i just could not invest in them much. Most of the time I could not see the siginificance of where they were going and why. I had a similar issue with the Bayaz and band's quest in book 2 - lots of small skirmishes, but they just seemed similar in nature. And very, very low stakes. Of course, Logen's mega duel was amazing.
3. Limited worldbuilding: Maybe it's my own bias - but I've enjoyed books like ASOIAF, Eragon, LOTR where there's plenty of lore and adequate description of the world. Here, I often felt lost when it came to distances, the world in general. I think this is something the author specifically went for, but I just didn't like it as much. There were no answers to why is the North attacking, why is Bethod so powerful, why doesn't Bayaz like Bethod,  why is Bayaz bringing Logen/Ferro/Jezal with him (the reveal does come...in the amazing final act). This all made the second book quite painful to me. I also didn't get the magic system, Bayaz's past till very late in the books, which made it a chore sometimes.
4. The battles: I don't mind the often first person limited POVs taken (e.g., the siege in book 3), but what I didn't like at all was how all the battles Union won were in a similar fashion - they were losing the XXX battle, but their allied army comes and surprises the enemy forces - repeatedly. IIRC the siege in the North (with Logen and his band) and the last battle happened very similarly - and it was back to back. I would have preferred some more creativity, like the siege Glokta undertakes. I really enjoyed the large scale battles in LOTR and Eragon, I'm a sucker for those :)
5. Humour: I didn't get as many laughs out of it as I was told online...but maybe that's just me? I think only HP's made me laugh a lot, with its wittyness.
6. That being said, I enjoyed the final half of the third book a lot! I also liked how the core message of the characters being gray, and the general deconstruction of the tropes usually employed.",fantasy
What book did you have high expectations for but ended up being too much or too few?,"In my case, this happened with *Rusalka* by C.J. Cherryh. Let me explain: I really love her work specially the earlier ones because she had a strong influence of the early-XX century pulps -you can see shades of John Carter in *Angel with the Sword,* for example-, and since a few years ago I had a kick for everything related to historical Russia/Ukraine/Eastern Europe (thanks Harold Lamb for this!), so the combination of the setting and fast-paced, complex characters of Cherryh would be a winner for me. I couldn't have been more wrong...

The novel feels a little too long for such a minimalist cast (there are only four or five human characters, and the entire story mostly occurs in a log cabin in a wood along the Dnieper), and Cherryh on this one tend too much for introspection of the lead duo (I don't know if she was trying to imitate the psychological introspection so characteristic of classic Russian literature or something like that; the novel was originally published in 1989 at the tail end of the Soviet Union/Iron Curtain, so maybe she view a potential public there for her *œuvre)*. And this is the first of a trilogy, and, as of 2024, I haven't wanted to read the following ones...",fantasy

The Legend of Shen Li: A Chinese Fantasy Romance Drama You Can't Miss,"Hello everyone,

**The Legend of Shen Li**  is a Chinese drama that caught my attention earlier this year, and I would like to recommend it to all fantasy slowburn romance lovers out there.

It is an epic Chinese fantasy drama that blends action, romance, and mythology into a beautifully crafted story. The series follows Shen Li, a fierce and powerful spirit, and Xing Zhi, a gentle and mysterious warrior. Their paths cross amid a chaotic world filled with immortal beings, demons, and political intrigue. As they face countless obstacles and battles, a deep romance blooms between them, creating a compelling love story wrapped in high-stakes fantasy.

The drama stands out for its strong character development, especially with Shen Li’s portrayal as a resilient, independent woman who holds her own in a male-dominated world. The chemistry between the leads adds emotional depth to the stunning visuals and fight choreography, making it a well-rounded viewing experience. From breathtaking landscapes to heart-pounding action scenes, the production quality is top-notch, and the intricate plot twists will keep you hooked.

The Old Kingdom (G. Nix),"I recently picked up these books because of a recommendation from this sub. It's been a while since I devoured a series with this kind of fervour. It isn't an easy thing to make a fantasy series feel original/refreshing - the whole genre being bogged down (at times) by tropes like warriors/wizards etc.

These books were also delightful to me after I had, by chance, read almost exclusively grimdark/gritty/brutal fantasy novels for most of this year.

These books manage to be immersive, and magical, without any hint of explicit violence, sex etc. I don't necessarily mind these themes, but when you read a string of books of this ilk, it can affect your perception of fantasy in general lol.

Anybody else here got love for these books?",fantasy
Is Michael Moorcock unfashionable now? ,"Ive noticed in book shops with large sci fi/fantasy sections, they have heaps of classic books. Some I’d have thought fairly obscure. But no Michael Moorcock. But then you go to second hand book shops and sometimes there is a whole shelf of his stuff.

"Something like the storm light archive or mistborne, but not written by Sanderson?","I'm wondering if there are any other books that have a similar vibe and prose to these series but that are written by another author other than Sanderson?

I really like the idea of non conventional fantasy worlds. I'm not into grim dark so please do recommend grim dark books such as asoiaf or things by Joe Abercrombie, or Malazan and the like. I prefer things that are more in the realm of darkness that mistborn and the storm light archive inhabit, which isn't too dark.

I don't necessarily need hard magic systems, I'm more interested in good action, unique worlds and world building.

I'm also interested in stories that feature gay male characters but this is not at all a must. Just a bonus.

Second person narrative in the Broken Earth Trilogy,"I avoided reading anything by NK Jemisin for the longest time. Her novels receive high praise, but it seems to always be because of her bold artistic choices and not necessarily because of the stories themselves. The second person narrative in Broken Earth (or at least in The Fifth Season) was a major red flag, so even if I had the book home I never dared open it until recently.

It turns out it is perhaps not grinding my gears as much as I feared (and I think it is because of the present tense, unlike in Harrow the Ninth where the past tense – you did this, you did that – made my brain refuse to accept what I was reading — I most definitely _had not_ done _that_). Reading it still feels much more demanding than I would like to. I can't stop thinking _why_ in the world that narrative choice would be necessary here, when it clearly affects the reading experience.

I am only like 50 pages in and I already find it difficult to see myself enduring 300 pages more of this. I have heard many times that the grindy experience is worth it, that the choice makes sense in hindsight. Yet no one ever mentions _why_ it makes sense, because I assume it would be spoilery. (I know the motivation behind the choice in Harrow the Ninth and I still don't find it justified, for what is worth.)

So I guess my questions are:
1. Is it _really_ justified and worth the grind?
2. If so, at what point does the reason behind the choice get apparent? Is it by the end of the fist book? Before? Later in the series?
3. Just for my own sanity in case I decide I can't bear it anymore, what is _the reason_? (but please use a spoiler tag if you answer this ~~)",fantasy
Fantasy books for kids 9-13,"Hey guys, looking into books for my kids. They are pretty good readers now, so YA books could be included in this.

Any books where the villain suffers setbacks and struggles as much as the hero?,"I really dislike the trope where the antagonist(s) win at everything they do and seem infallible until the end. You've all seen stories where the heroes are ""relatable"" bumbling idiots for 80% of the story, and then the universe aligns ever-so-perfectly to give them wins in the last 20%.   If the antagonists do not suffer setbacks or defeats, how would a villain learn, evolve, grow and reflect on the mistakes that one made?

It does create more tension and desperation for the protagonists, but I like the concept of this applying to the antagonists as well. I want to see a book where the villain has to take things seriously and carefully just to survive.

Edit: Well, this blew up! Thanks for your suggestions! I think I'll go delve into Black Company and  Dandelion Dynasty, having already read Red Rising and a Practical Guide to Evil.",fantasy
I find myself increasingly attracted to the 80s and 90s titles. What was the magic of this time? Any modern writers keeping the tradition alive?  ,"In short, the more I read, the more I realize that I am mostly interested in books published during a relatively short time period of 1980s and early 1990s, which is very strange since I am about 25 myself and got into fantasy by reading modern classics like Geiman. To give you some context, I really liked:

* Moorcock. Elric's Cycle! It is my guilty pleasure and I am not ashamed to admit it.
* Zelazny. I have probably read almost everything the man wrote. I just love his prose - though I cannot quite explain why.
* Cook. From Garrett P.I. to Black Company... There is something special about this terse beautiful gentleman.
* Kay. For some reason, I find his earlier works easier to read. Tigana, A Song for Arbonne. He's just pleasant to read, like Zelazny but in a different way.
* Moon. Paks' cycle is another guilty pleasure.
* Gene Wolfe. Sometimes difficult to get through, but worth it once you do.

On the other hand, when I get to the modern writers, something just does not click for me. Again, being more specific:

* Martin. I actually liked the worldbuilding and the conflict in the first three books of ASOIAF, but he obviously lost the direction later.
* Abercrombie. I feel like he would be a good movie director. The stories are reasonably fast and held my attention, but his eclectic and generic world and love for b-movie-style repetitive violence annoyed me.
* Sanderson. I just couldn't get into it (I tried Mistborn). Perhaps he is not my writer, though I plan to try another one of his books later.
* Hobb. I read her latest trilogy and can confidently attest that I hated all the important characters.
* Mieville. Here it gets complicated. I started with the Train Station and continued with The Scar. On the one hand, Mieville's a very creative writer and I liked the setting. On the other hand, I could tell his political leanings after a few dozen pages. I am sure that if I read more of him I will be able to determine what kind of communist he is, exactly. Heavy-handed moralizing is something I found off-putting in modern fantasy in general. Like, I am smart enough to understand what you're getting at (at least I would like to believe so), stop hammering home the point that class divide/colonialism/oppression of women etc. is bad. Show, don't tell!

Does anyone else feel like that sometimes? What do you think was so special about the 80s/90s style and prose? And most importantly, are there any writers that continue this tradition?

Is there anyone besides me who really appreciates the ability to read ebooks without knowing how much is left?,"I shifted almost exclusively to ebooks ages ago (I don't have any problems with ebook as a format and they are cheaper and easier to get). One thing that was a completely unexpected boon for me is the ability to turn off indicators and not to know where I am in the book (You obviously would not mistake the 10th page for the middle, but once you are sure you are past the middle the error bars are so large that book can end at any moment). Once you have read hundreds of ""genre"" books you know the general flow well enough the remaining length itself becomes a sort of ""spoiler"". So the ability to avoid that kind of spoiler adds to my enjoyment significantly. Anybody else with similar experiences?",fantasy

Looking for some winter-y fantasy.,"What I have in idea so far is Narnia, His Dark Materials, Memory Sorrow and Thorn, and/or the sword of Kaigen.  
All I know about Narnia is Christian themes, all I know about His Dark Materials is anti-religious themes and armored polar bears, I know next to nothing of MS&amp;T other than it is classic high fantasy which I tend to like. Sword of Kaigen all i know is it is asian culture and it is an indie book lol.

Other books I like a lot for point of reference:  
LotR  
Harry potter  
Dune

Robin Hobb’s Mastery of Female Characters: An Appreciation,"So I’ve read the Farseer Trilogy and right now I'm in the middle of *The Mad Ship*, the second book of the Liveship Traders trilogy. I loved all the character work in the Farseer books, but it mainly focused on male characters. Fitz, Burrich, and Chade were incredible, and while Hobb’s writing was top-notch, I’ve seen other authors do amazing male characters too.

But what really blew me away is the way Hobb writes her female characters in the Liveship Traders trilogy. Seriously, I don't think I’ve ever seen characters like this before.

First, there's Althea—strong, independent, proud, stubborn as hell, and constantly pushing against society’s norms. The way Hobb writes her is just so precise and real. You feel every bit of her struggle and defiance, and it’s incredible.

Then there’s my personal fave, Malta Vestrit. Honestly, I’ve never read a teenage girl character written this well in any book. She’s rebellious, spoiled, sly, and knows how to manipulate to get what she wants. But the thing is, even as a guy, I find myself understanding her, and there are times when she’s not even in the wrong. I just know her character is gonna grow so much from here, and I’m all in for it.

Ronica is another standout—this strong matriarch trying to keep her family together after losing her husband. Her struggle, her fights with her daughters and granddaughter, it’s all captured beautifully. You can feel the weight on her shoulders.  
  
And Vivacia, the liveship herself, is like nothing I’ve read before. She’s almost like a newborn, with all the confusion and chaos that comes with being brought to life. The angst of innocence, the need for love and understanding, and then losing the only person she’s ever known—it’s heartbreaking. But she’s also got this fierce zeal to explore the world, and you can’t help but get charmed right along with her when a headstrong bad boy starts trying to win her over. I can’t believe how well her arc has been written so far; it’s like watching a person grow up right in front of you.

Then there’s Keffria—seems weak and timid at first, super traditional, and never stands up to her husband even when she knows he’s wrong. But you can see the growth happening, and it’s not easy to capture that in a character.

And I can’t forget Amber and Etta—both so well written. I’m still trying to figure out Etta’s motives, but she’s got layers, and I love it.

Honestly, Robin Hobb might just be the best when it comes to writing female characters. The depth, the nuance, the way they feel so real... it’s just next level. I can’t wait to see where these characters go next.

PS - I think the male characters - Brashen, Kennit, Wintrow are incredible as well. But for me it was so refreshing to read some actually well written female characters. ",fantasy
List of Books with Tournaments,"Hey all!

I love me a good tournament, whether it's in book, anime, or movie form, so I've been working on compiling a list of books with tournaments in them from various posts here and other reddits. I was hoping you all could help me flesh it out, so if you see an error or something I'm missing, please let me know. Also, I enjoy including the name of the tournament if possible, so if you happen to know that, please feel free to say. Thanks in advance for any help!

Btw, I didn't include Prince Oberyn vs the Mountain in Storm of Swords because that was a one-off duel. I may make a list of those in the future, too (Drizzt vs Entreri? Yes, please!), but I wanted to start with this one.

THE WRAITH RETURNS ('Revenge of the Wraith Paladin' Book 1) by Paul G. Zareith - Book Review,"**Blurb:**

A fallen warrior discovers that the mission of his life was one enormous deception.  
  
A race of scavenger aliens orchestrates the most dangerous maneuver to save themselves.  
  
An ambitious researcher is willing to stake the lives of millions to become the next great power.  
  
A celestial reconciler is ready to wipe out entire civilizations to restore space-time continuity.  
  
Who will survive? And at what cost...  
  
Discover in this grimdark epic saga.

 

**Review:**

To begin with, in all honesty, I had absolutely no idea that this total GEM of a book was out and about until the author made a very kind and generous offer for me to read and review his debut novel. The fact that ‘ancient/early India’ was both an inspiration and a setting for it got my attention straight away. Not to forget that the description was very, very intriguing as well. An indie debut that marks the start to a new grimdark epic saga… inspired and based on ancient India, you say?! HECK YEAH! Count me right in!

Needless to say, I immediately accepted the offer! I had never before ventured into Indian inspired/based grimdark SFF, with ‘THE SHIVA TRILOGY’ by Amish being the only proper exception (and although it does have dark tones/themes, it is still classed as just fantasy rather than being grimdark). If you haven’t checked it out, I would highly recommend that you do so. Also, a certain Gaurav Mohanty has been making waves globally through his debut ‘SONS OF DARKNESS’, which does indeed classify as an Indian grimdark fantasy. How am I yet to check it out remains a mystery even to myself (need to do it asap!).

The point being – Indian grimdark is quite rare (unless I’m mistaken, that is!), and to finally be able to have a go at one such story was quite something. So yeah. I was super, super eager and equally excited for it. And hence, before we move on, I would like to extend my highest of thanks towards the author, Paul, for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.

 

**What’s it about?**

***War had been, after all, coming for a long time.***

Rather than me trying to break down the stuff that’s happening, here’s a quick synopsis that was pitched by the author himself (sums it up perfectly in my opinion!):

*Rana has given up all hope when he realises that his decade long quest to exact revenge on a corrupt aristocracy and a totalitarian religious order has been exploited by an otherworldly malicious organisation determined to destabilise the very foundation of the known civilization.*  
*Against all odds though, he finds himself free of his shackles in a world that he barely recognizes.*

*As Rana gradually comes to understand the world he has woken up in, many strange facts begin to unfold. The alien gods whom he and his companions had brought down, have managed to alter the timeline as a last ditch attempt to save themselves. The empire he fought for, the army he stood with and the patron deity who helped their civilization prosper are all gone.*

*The world now is a bleak dark place, and the alien scavengers are aggressively stripping the planet of the mineral that forms the foundation of all runecraft - the traditional magic system that mages have used since time immemorial. Thanks to their actions, the practice of runecraft has been relegated to something in myths and bedtime stories. Slavery and violence run rampant and with every day that passes, the world moves closer to chaos and anarchy.*

*Rana's only hope is that he still has access to an older, ancient but dangerous form of magic. And he is not alone. His sister whom he long thought dead, apparently still survives and can play a crucial role in saving the world. As Rana slowly discovers, there are enough who abhor their mysterious overlords for what they are and what they have done - and are willing to stand up for what is right.*

“The story takes place in a fictional world, but the setup is partly inspired by early India. Basically what led me to this story was the question - what if ancient India was the epicenter of civilization in the old world, and the mughals invading the country were actually a race of vampires from another world, intent on scavenging the resources that the subcontinent has to offer. It is written for a niche audience - essentially people who like intricate plots, lovecraftian themes and morally gray characters.”

How could someone possibly say no to this?! No wonder I was super pumped to jump into it straight away! (and rightly so indeed!)

 

**The good:**

●       First off, let me just get it out there before anything else – this was an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING debut by all means! Really exceeded and surpassed all the expectations! A real GEM of a read, and one of the BEST indie reads of the year for me hands down.

●       The characters were really well-written; gray, fleshed out, and with their respective past/backgrounds present as well. New ones were introduced throughout, and really added to the story.

●       The plot was excellent! Loved it! Fast-paced, loads of action, mystery, and drama present that kept me hooked till the end. There were several plotlines going on simultaneously, with the narrative switching back and forth between them. Did I mention time travel shenanigans and leviathan monsters were present too?!

●       The magic system, and the whole lore surrounding it, was quite detailed and very well depicted. Not to forget the blood sorcery, which added a whole new dimension and depth to the world. Really enjoyed it all.

●       The writing was very good altogether, and I really, really liked the bleak, sort of gray world and setting that the author put forward. Again, altogether, really well-written and really well fleshed out.

●       There were multiple POVs present, with both first person and third person perspectives. I thought all the POVs were handled really well. The ending was crazy, with fast, multi-POV action!

●       There were loads of Indian/Hindi/Sanskrit names, words, and terms present, which were not only nicely incorporated into the story, but, as an Indian myself, was a great reading experience in itself (gotta be honest!).

●       The ending was very satisfactory, super fun and action-packed, and sets up the sequel very well and in an intriguing manner.

 

**The “not so” good:**

●       My only complaint would be that the lore and worldbuilding might get a bit overwhelming at times, mainly due to the fact that there’s just so much depth present overall. There’s absolutely no doubt that I really enjoyed and loved it. But on certain occasions, it just felt a little too much to take in!

 

**The standout stuff:**

●       The moon, a pale sliver in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering flames licking at the edges of abandoned stalls. They had set up a hideout under an abandoned construction site which also served as the makeshift stash for the weapons and enchanted items they could gather. *\[excerpt from one of the chapters; this particular one was just so much fun to read!*\]

●       There was an old saying that Karma loops around through links in destiny.

●       “… Faith has a way of swaying people that reason cannot quite match.”

●       When all cards are stacked against you, you need to sharpen and hone every weapon in your arsenal, irrespective of whether or not you like the feel of its shape.

 

Any skill requires practice, and essence manipulation requires practicing on blood - preferably blood that is still connected to life - after all it is not the blood itself that the magic targets, but the life essence coursing through it.

 

All life fights for preservation of its essence. Essence harvesting is, in its core, the art of repurposing the essence that fuels life, to fuel whatever magic the harvester desires. For a skilled essence harvester, wrestling life out of even enormous beasts who have lived for centuries is within the realm of possibility.

 

**Other info.**

●       A beautiful map of Ildaria is present at the start.

●       A detailed glossary of the various Indian/Hindi/Sanskrit terminologies is present at the end (loved it!).

●       There are quite a few subtle Indian references, especially that of culture/folklore, present throughout which were wonderful to read.

●       ***Warning:*** “This work includes vivid depictions of violence and may not be suitable for all readers.” Other trigger warnings include – blood/gore, swearing, etc.

 

**Final thoughts**

‘The Wraith Returns’ by Paul G. Zareith is AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING INDIE DEBUT by all means. This opening chapter to a new grimdark epic fantasy series inspired and based upon ancient India is certainly NOT TO BE MISSED. Boasting a fast-paced, action-packed plot having very well-written, gray characters, multi-POVs, a rich dose of lore/worldbuilding, and an incredibly detailed and fun magic system, it certainly manages to grab hold of you until the very end. I had a total blast reading it, and cannot RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY enough. Go check it out now!

&gt;Kadou, the shy prince of Arasht, finds himself at odds with one of the most powerful ambassadors at court—the body-father of the queen's new child—in an altercation which results in his humiliation.  
&gt;  
&gt;To prove his loyalty to the queen, his sister, Kadou takes responsibility for the investigation of a break-in at one of their guilds, with the help of his newly appointed bodyguard, the coldly handsome Evemer, who seems to tolerate him at best. In Arasht, where princes can touch-taste precious metals with their fingers and myth runs side by side with history, counterfeiting is heresy, and the conspiracy they discover could cripple the kingdom’s financial standing and bring about its ruin.

&gt;Lorelei Kaskel, a folklorist with a quick temper and an even quicker wit, is on an expedition with six eccentric nobles in search of a fabled spring. The magical spring promises untold power, which the king wants to harness in order to secure his reign over the embattled country of Brunnestaad. Lorelei is determined to use this opportunity to prove herself and make her wildest, most impossible dream come true: to become a naturalist, able to travel freely to lands she’s only read about.  
&gt;  
&gt;The expedition gets off to a harrowing start when its leader—Lorelei’s beloved mentor—is murdered in her quarters aboard their ship. The suspects are her five remaining expedition mates, each with their own motive. The only person Lorelei knows must be innocent is her longtime academic rival, the insufferably gallant and maddeningly beautiful Sylvia von Wolff. Now in charge of the expedition, Lorelei must find the spring before the murderer strikes again—and a coup begins in earnest.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are other dangers lurking in the forests that rearrange themselves at night, rivers with slumbering dragons waiting beneath the water, and shapeshifting beasts out for blood.  
&gt;  
&gt;As Lorelei and Sylvia grudgingly work together to uncover the truth—and resist their growing feelings for one another—they discover that their professor had secrets of her own. Secrets that make Lorelei question whether justice is worth pursuing, or if this kingdom is worth saving at all.

High Fantasies for Picky Reader (me)?,"I love the *idea* of the high fantasy genre, deep lore, and interesting world building. Yet, I lose interest in nearly every fantasy novel I attempt. The only fantasy series that I've successfully read and enjoyed have been The Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Dune.

Generally, I read horror the most, with some sci-fi. But I'm not beholden to any genre and enjoy anything cerebral, surreal, weird, and genre-defying. I'm not sure what my problem is with fantasy, but I think it boils down to simultaneously wanting to read something that feels like 'classic' fantasy and yet I find most of that type begin with very simplistic premises masked with worldbuilding terms and names which either are so dense it's discouraging or so generic that I lose track of who is who and what is what. I also dislike overly complicated magic systems that come across as video game-y, and tend to enjoy things grounded in a little more realism (which is why, I believe, I enjoyed A Song of Ice and Fire so much). Again though, I don't necessarily feel as though I'm beholden to anything only.

Books with actual Spymaster or Intelligence Chief or Espionage Director major/main pov (NOT JUST SPY POV MIND YOU cause there are like millions of spy pov),"There are sooo many spy povs in many books in hindsight but somehow no real Spymaster or Intelligence Chief or Espionage Director major povs they typically are side characters or background characters.

Like the only real example I have for a spymaster pov and protagonist somehow comes from a *romance book LOL* which is **Forsaken Bride by Alice Coldbreath**. It was pretty fun portrayal of a spymaster sending many nondescript spies to action, intercepting letters, allowing enough information to get the spies from other factions to work according to how he wants, manipulating people, getting servants/commoners to spread rumors or gather info, assassinations and all that.  And he does none of the actual spy work but rather is directing all of it from his desk and the court with his internal monologue constantly working and thinking on ways to manipulate people and get things done for their faction. That's the kind of pov I wanna see

After reading so many fantasy/scifi novels cant believe I found a major spymaster pov from a romance novel instead. So I want it from fantasy instead

The other closest example *that from fantasy* would be **Mage's Blood by David Hair** one of the pov actually belongs to a spymaster who is consistenly moving pieces on the board but the problem is that the pov of the character isnt really a major one as far as I have read.

ASOIAF has a bunch of spymaster characters surprisingly BUT I dont remember them having major pov. Somehow little finger and varys dont have pov I believe

**DO NOT RECOMMEND THEY DONT FIT (they have spy/agent pov not spymaster .. and at most if there is a spymaster pov it is barely there):** Wheel of Time, Codex Alera, Malazan, Farseer and Stormlight Archives

They all have decent espionage worldbuilding and lots of secrets but they do not have spymaster povs at all.

Real life places that would fit in a Fantasy setting,"Disclaimer: this discussion will likely involve real world places of religious, cultural and social significance to various peoples, so it should be said that I intend no disrespect or offense to anyone or anywhere, this is just a thought exercise to inspire creativity.

Hello, folks! The title is self explanatory. There are many and many places in our world that sometime or another were regarded as mystical or magical, or foci of supernatural activity, like Mt. Olympus, the Stonehenge, the Pyramids, Uppsala, the Bodhi tree in India and many others.

I'm interested in places that are more ""mundane"" of sorts but that for their purpose or scenic quality you could envision in a Fantasy setting. For example, the Kiwi landscapes that were used in Peter Jackson's LOTR movies, or the Lençóis Maranhenses in my own country that were used for Vormir in the MCU.

What about the ossuary churches in Czechia and Europe? Their aesthetics could function to depict the lair of some undead or necromancer lord, as in Diabo or TES. Also, Pripyat inspired the STALKER series, but could well be used in a more Urban Fantasy or even Low Fantasy scenario, as do some of those impressive Soviet era abandoned megabuildings.

Is it normal to take extensive notes while reading a long series?,"I think I have a problem. Let’s take The Wheel of Time as an example. I'm currently halfway through book 5, and I’ve already written about 200 pages of notes just to keep track of my thoughts. Whenever I read, I constantly jot down things that I think are important to remember. These could be small details, like traits that reveal a character's personality, how they react in certain situations, and, of course, the subplots—what each character is doing at any given moment. I'm obsessed with having complete control over the series because I have such low confidence in my ability to retain information. I worry that if I don’t take notes, I won’t remember the true essence of the characters’ personalities. I'm afraid I'll forget exactly what happened the last time a particular character had a point-of-view chapter.

I rarely look at my notes, but they bring me comfort, even though keeping them is exhausting. I suspect what I'm doing may be unnecessary, but I can’t shake the fear of forgetting important details. I’m also unsure if it’s normal to struggle with remembering what was said just three chapters ago without checking back. Because I don’t know how much a typical person retains, I feel uncertain and rely on note-taking to avoid forgetting. But the truth is, I'm not lost. I do understand the personalities and actions of each character. I’m writing this to seek some feedback or advice.

Thank You to Fantasy Authors Who Don’t Write Doorstoppers!,"Wanted to take a quick moment to thank all the authors out there who write fantasy series and manage to keep their books in that sweet 400-500 page range (or shorter). A special shoutout to those who can easily increase page count for each subsequent book in a series but actively decide not to do so. Mark Lawrence, Richard Swann, Robert Jackson Bennett, Jeff VanderMeer just to name a few. 


Don't get me wrong, I love getting lost in a good long series, but sometimes it’s great to pick up a book and not feel like I need a week off work to get through it. Lately, I’ve noticed so many series that start off with manageable page counts but turn into 1200+ pages as they go on. I get it, you’ve got an epic story to tell, but a lot of that is more often than not just bloat. 

There are some of us that love a shorter book.",fantasy

"What do you think of this statement that ""Fantasy Humans Aren't Really Human""?","This one:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRoAfD6bCQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRoAfD6bCQ4)

  
A lot of fantasy setting leave out some fundamental aspects of the humans we know. The grimy parts. The sad fact is that, historically, every single human society has been heavily sexist, xenophobic to some degree, and most of them practised slavery at some point. Just to name a few examples. Clearly these things are somehow built into us, and only education, interconnectedness and vigilance keeps them somewhat at bay.

Meanwhile, a lot of setting have humans tolerate not only other ethnic groups but whole other SPECIES (with admittedly varying levels of tolerance), women in positions of power (without it being a rarity), and some degree of enlightenment around how people should be treated.

I don't deny this makes the settings more pleasant to read than a history book, but it also... isn't US, really. Or is it? What do you think?

Please rec me fast paced books that are easy enough for a grade schooler to understand. ,"Hi, I have a ADHD problem. So when I can neither find a character that I like, or when things aren't happening fast enough I find it impossible to keep paying attention.

For reference, I would considered the lord of the rings to be medium paced.

So I suppose anything faster than that?

I'm not a fan of slice of life, or when things rarely feel very high stakes (e.g. Discworld), but I'm not into the level of grimdark that Berserk is either -- I don't mind when atrocities happen, but it's hard to care when I don't feel hope for anyone.

I would also like something more digestible? The Lies of Locke Lamora had one of the more easy to understand intros. Meanwhile, A Song of Ice and Fire =  I can't keep track of anything. Rapidly switching POVs means because by the time the author gets back to the other other character I've already forgotten what happened before. 

The book I last tried to read was The Blade Itself from The First Law, where I found the inquisitor/torturer to be a funny guy, but no one else really stuck out, and I couldn't figure out where the plot was, so I gave up.

I should probably skip to the next book? Since that's where Friend said the story picks up?",fantasy
Is there any fantasy that has the aesthetics of Early Middle Ages but not about Vikings?,"The Early Middle Ages is from 500-900 AD which incorporates era of barbarian tribal kingdoms such as Goths, Vandals, Franks and others, the arrival of Anglo-Saxons to British Isles, Carolingian Empire, the Viking incursions, expansion of Middle East under banner of Islam in the middle East and many others.

Since there's a thread on disappointments - what are some SFF books that EXCEEDED your expectations?,"These can be books where you had low expectations but ended up impressed, or books that you expected to like but ended up falling in love with completely! Here are a few examples for me:

- Gene Wolfe - *The Book of the New Sun.* The great word of mouth surrounding this book got my hopes pretty high, and I went in expecting to have a good time. I ended up loving it more than I could've imagined, and it's easily in my top three books I've read. I think about this series so much, it's so dense and thought-provoking and not to mention a total joy to read!

- Mark Z. Danielewsky - *House of Leaves.* I knew I was going to like the book because the premise sounded interesting to me and I was intrigued by how it played with text formats, and when I got around to reading it, it delivered and then some. I found myself fascinated by the characters and themes, and the use of formatting adds so much to the theme of labyrinths in the book.

- Ray Bradbury - *The Martian Chronicles.* My love of his short stories got me interested in this book, and when I read it it became one of my favorite sci-fi books I've read. The prose is gorgeous and evocative, the stories within cover a diverse array of themes from colonialism to censorship to nuclear anxiety, always doing so in a gripping and poignant manner.

- Mary Shelley - *Frankenstein.* This book's influence and reputation had caught my attention well before I had read it, and when I did, I was completely awestruck by how well-written it was. Both the titular doctor and his monster are believable and complex characters who do terrible things but have sympathetic qualities and motives, and the conflict between them is so compelling and tragic.

- Susanna Clarke - *Piranesi.* I was drawn into this book for a somewhat similar reason that I was to *House of Leaves,* I just love the idea of exploring an expansive and labyrinthine house. But where this book got really exciting to me was when the mystery begins to develop. No spoilers, but once the story began to speed up I found myself at the edge of my seat and full of intrigue in a way I didn't fully expect going into the book. Definitely looking forward to reading Clarke's other work!

- Brandon Sanderson - *Oathbringer.* I had already liked the Stormlight Archive quite a bit for its character development, elaborate world-building and exciting action sequences, but *Oathbringer* escalated things in a way that I loved! The increasingly-massive conflict between humanity and the Parshendi goes to some pretty drastic and tense places with twists and turns that magnified my investment in the plot and characters, and the exploration of Dalinar's past appealed to me a lot. The climax was particularly excellent as well; a powerful moment of character development for Dalinar combined with the resolution of one major conflict that had been around since the first book made for a great time. For me at least, the books seem to get better and better with each entry!

- Mervyn Peake - *Titus Groan.* When I discovered the *Gormenghast* trilogy on this subreddit, I figured it would be up my alley, being set in a sprawling castle full of atmosphere. What I *didn't* expect was just how beautiful the prose would be and just how surreal the tone and aesthetics of the book would be. I love the character portraits, especially the bizarre designs of Swelter, Dr. Prunesquallor and the twins Cora and Clarice. It's a book that feels beautiful and disgusting at the same time, and I adore that kind of vibe!",fantasy

The Poppy war trilogy - opinion,"Ok, so I've read the trilogy and I'm incredibly disappointed. 

To begin with I didn't expect this book to be amazing. I read it with out looking at reviews and just looking for a good fantasy world to disappear for a while. 

But the plot and the characters are very very bad. 

I understand Rin is crazy. She makes the same mistake over and over again and expects different outcomes. But two books of this it get tiring; Kitai being her voice of reason and we don't get to see much of that. He just tells her ""you shouldn't do this"" and she is ""you are a coward. You don't understand"". 

The Trifecta.. like really? Master juang tells her exactly what's going to happen and she just goes for it anyway? 

Overall very underwhelming book. I think of instead of a trilogy it was two books or just one it would have been better.

But the book drags on and on in predictability, until the predictable ending.

I actually think is a good ending but it just... Like really? How many betrayals, battles, she just see the famine and goes: ""oh, we need to fix this for the next war"" like yes, we know she is crazy let's not do that again. 

I don't know. I just saw that Babel got a Nebula award and this was nominated?... How are this awards granted? Because really, for me this book was BAD.

* Discworld
* Lord of the Rings
* Chronicles of Narnia
* The Silver Crown
* The Phantom Tollbooth
* A Barrel of Laughs, A Vale of Tears
* Dracula (original Stoker book)
* The Once and Future King
* Flatland
* Some old original fairy tales as well as some of the Elder Edda

Here's what I've liked to varying degrees:

* Wizard of Earthsea
* Harry Potter
* The Last Wish (first Witcher book)
* The Navigator
* Beowulf (original tale)
* Salvatore's Drizzt books up until Spine of the World or thereabouts

Here are some I tried but found they were not for me:

* Mistborn
* Dresden Files
* Wheel of Time
* Game of Thrones (partly because of *that* Lannister relationship, partly because I want an actual resolution out there before trying again)

In terms of content, I:

* Do not want it ""spicy""
* Do not want a straigtht up romantasy unless it's *really* strong on other points
* Want it to be well-written with good, but not flowery, prose; I get this is super subjective, but I enjoy strong descriptions with attention to an economy of language
* Am open to a variety of settings and types of novels, but prefer something more on the sincere side (and I consider all of the books above that I loved to be sincere, even if some are also humorous)

Books with similar emotion and character development as Inheritance Cycle? ,"I’ve seen a few posts of people requesting books similar to the Inheritance Cycle here, but none have really answered what I’m looking for. 
I read a lot, and even though IC is considered YA, I actually thought the character development and world building to be fantastic, mature, and very realistic- I’ve yet to read another fantasy series where I’ve felt that connected and invested in the characters. There was so much emotion and a big focus on deep relationships between the different characters, and I just loved the sweetness of Eragon and Saphira’s relationship.

Can anyone recommend a book or series that has a similar feeling? Like maybe something with more of an emphasis on character relationships? All the recommendations I see are just other dragon books, which isn’t really the main reason I loved Inheritance Cycle, so doesn’t need to be about dragons. 

For reference I just finished Mistborn 1: The Final Empire and thought it was incredibly flat and one dimensional and pretty poorly written (sorry Sanderson).",fantasy
So I finished red rising book 1 and it was kind of disappointing,"I really don't want to just rag on the entire book It wasn't horrible it just wasn't what I expected. It started off interesting enough Eo was very predictable but I liked the setup of it and the big Mars civilization reveal was nice. I enjoyed the way they incorporated him being herclean into the plot of his bodies creation but where it falls flat for me is the institute plot

At first I wasn't bothered by the institute the idea was nice. Athough it's one big cheesy trope and kind of predictable there were stakes and a purpose I felt some real tension darrow is a sculpted specimen but there was still danger. After Cassius stabbed him I thought there would be a more evolved story with some character growth as well as him learning a lesson about caution, but it just devolves into nonsense which wasted that plot point. Everything becomes too easy and any stakes or reason for him being there feel empty there's technically something there but I feel unengaged with the plot and the lovestory. Important things happen as well as big battles but I struggled to actually care about any of it. All the action feels empty  because I know the only way it ends is Darrow wins everything and it all goes perfectly within 30 minutes, the only thing that really happens is Pax dying but the guy was kind of annoying so I was glad about that.

I didn't like most of the characters a third person would have probably helped but i dont know. Sevro and Fichtner were fun they are like the antithesis to what a gold is supposed to be which makes for a nice contrast. Proctors given unbound control over the test with control over the evidence being sent back to their superiors is really REALLY stupid but I let it go. My biggest gripe of all though are how these ""peerless scarred"" proctors are handled they are too comically evil and stupid for me to take seriously and that's what ruined it for me because by the end they were so easily defeated I got 0 satisfaction out of any of it, and I lose most of my interest after that.

I definitely  into this expecting the wrong type of book like I said I don't think it's terrible it just wasn't what I was hoping for, the plot kind of comes back together at the very end but darrow still makes me cringe and I don't think I'll continue it at all this just isn't my type of book. It's a solid 2/5",fantasy

Problems that are too accurate to the real world,"
Does anyone else find certain things happening in fantasy books to be too accurate in a way that drags you out of your immersion in a book? 

For me lately, I'm finding that when lies are told about the main character or a situation, and those lies are believed by people, especially supposed allies or neutral parties, I actually hate it. It breaks my immersion.

It's not at all that it's inaccurate. It's incredibly accurate. The problem is, I feel like that is half of real life, especially politics, but in work situations too, where people believe lies, and it causes huge problems.

And so reading that frustration actually drags me out of my immersion in the book(s) because I start thinking about the real world.

I found that a ton with S. A. Chakraborty. I'm finding it with the books I'm reading now too, the Halfling Saga by Melissa Blair (which is really good! A couple really minor plot things that don't quite make sense to me, but overall I'm really enjoying it).

Does anyone else have a similar issue, either with that, or other things that are accurate, but annoy you even though it's unfair, just because you want a little more escapism (or any other reason)?",fantasy

I just DNF'd Licanus Trilogy,"*WARNING, SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*  
  
After reading ""The Will of the Many"" and loving it, I was very excited to read another James Islington book.  
  
Boy, I was disappointed.  
I got through the first book and it was OK... But I DNF'd on book 2.  
  
The best way I can describe the sieres is ""a shambles"". It is here there and everywhere and I feel like the Author was a bit out of his depth with this very ambitious project.  
  
Here are a few of the reasons I DNF'd.  
  
- ""Bemused""  
Everyone is bemused! This is clearly one of James Islingtons favourite words and he does not vary it. At. All.      
    
  
- ""And then / Suddenly!""  
There are hundreds of these moments. Like the author doesn't like to let the book breathe so the always has to be drama. It felt like he got bored while writing slow bits so literally just adds - *suddenly!* a vision / explosion / attack / monster etc.  
This one is followed closely by....  
  
- ""everything went black""  
My gods. Everyone in this book should be suffering from brain damage with the amount of times they end up unconscious.  
  
- Everyone's an expert at reading facial expressions?    
Seriously, how are they all able to tell someone is lying or not by the sincerity of their expression. They ""just know"" their telling the truth. And this would've been forgivable if it was just Caeden. Even understandable with his age. But no, every single character does this multiple times.  
  
- Inconsistent transparency  
So much time is spent on explaining mudane intricate details in a play-by-play of the characters movements, world mechanics, internal monologues... But then they hatch a critical plan to solve 'x' problem and all the details are withheld to be revealed later in a big surprise twist. Which would be fine if two sentences before there wasn't a detailed exposition dump of Davian pondering the philosophical nature of his powers.  
  
But all of those gripes were forgiven. All of them...  
Until Tol Shen...  
When Rohin seizes control over the entire Tol, compelling people to commit atrocities against each other—suicides, murders, even implied acts of sexual violence.  
  
""Suddenly"" Davian’s moral compass inexplicably prevails, and he can't kill Rohin, despite the very clear danger he poses and the horrors hes commited against his friends and the people protecting him.  
  
Then, it's revealed that Rohin's intrusion was supposedly to ""save Davian"". Its so insane: ""I'm here to save you, but first, let me murder everyone and r##e them.""  
But he's portrayed as - at worst - ""misguided""  
  
I couldn't do it anymore. That was the point where the whole sieres lost me. And I just knew this was going to be some rediculous plot serving convenience. So after deciding to DNF I looked it up and lo and behold... Scyner now gets the Amulet. Ta-da!  
  
I knew then I made the right decision. This book is not for me anymore.   
  
This sieres had so much potential and I genuinely love the richness of the world in which its set. But I think James Islington over committed based on his skill as an author at that point in time.  
He tried to be too tricky with its sprawling complex intertwining plots and the multitude of ""suddenly"" moments. It ended up coming across as scattered, disjointed and convenient.  
  
I know it will never happen but I'd love for a rewrite of this sieres once he has a few more books under his belt. I think it has the makings of one of the greats, but unfortunately felt like a rough draft. ",fantasy

"Experienced, Strong Protagonist","Hi, I am looking for books with protagonist who starts already experienced and strong or capable to deal with situations they are put in. The better the book in general and the more the protagonist is involved in conflicts that actually play to their strengths the better. 

Less so if the protagonist is strong, but generally inexperienced (e.g. Rand from WoT), or strong and experienced, but dealing with things outside their field of expertise (e.g. Dalinar from Stormlight Archives is a powerful and experienced fighter and warlord, who is put in a position of a politician). Or if the book itself isn't a very good read regardless meeting the criteria.



Books that would meet my requirements fully or partially:

1. Curse of Chalion - the protagonist is an experienced soldier, god's chosen, good teacher and a capable politician. The conflict is heavily political while also deals with the titular curse. The book is abolutely amazing, while the protagonist is put in situations which he can solve by making use of his strengths.

2. The Witcher - especially the short stories which focus on Geralt doing witcher things, for which he has trained and has life of experience dealing with. Less so, whenever the plot follows Ciri more closely.

3. Malazan

4. Discworld (parts of) - especially whenever Granny Weatherwax is on page. There are several other strong and experienced charactes as well.

5. The Shadow of the Gods - especially the Skullsplitter's pov.

6. The Year's Midnight (Death's Lady series) - Tenai is both experienced and extremely powerful, while Daniel is experienced and very capable at his job.

7. Tainted Cup - would fit especially well if we followed Ana Dolabra more closely than Din.

8. Paladin's Grace - strong and experienced berserk-paladin and skillfull perfume maker.

9. Art of Prophecy - everything where the ""chosen's"" pov isn't followed on page.

10. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi - I guess it fits, though I didn't enjoy the book much.

11. The Last Horizon series - strongest people in the galaxy team up against strongest galaxy-ending threats.

12. First Law series - especially Logen Ninefingers, Glokta and Monza povs.

13. Legend - he is THE Legend.

14. Spirits of Vengeance - an immortal onmyoji does onmyoji stuff on evil spirits.



Books on my TBR that I think may fit:

1. Powder Mage

Happy Hobbit Day - it was published today in 1937,"I always felt it was kind of funny that The Hobbit gets ignored in most criticisms of Tolkien. I'm an academic with classes in JRR so I get exposed to them more but usually, the surface readings of it always go on about pro-monarchy sentiments and divine rights of kings, fallen ages, and evil races. However, if you read The Hobbit, it actually feels like Tolkien is sending up his own critics' ideas of himself.

Thorin is the one true king of the dwarves and as blue blooded/divine right of kings as they come. He's also a complete ass. Thorin is constantly leading the group into disaster, a frankly terrible leader, and a bit of a coward as he sends Bilbo into the dragon's den first. He also almost ends up in a pointless war with the elves and humans over gold. The Elf King isn't much better and Bard fully intends to march on the Lonely Mountain to rob the joint. Though, to be fair, Bard perhaps has a point that the dwarves brought ruin on his people.

The elves, dwarves, and races of men are traditionally the ""good"" races of fantasy but with the exception of Elrond, they're pretty much always at each other's throats the entirety of the book. What manages to unite men and elves is initially gold and later a mutual threat that is properly portrayed as ragingly hypocritical. The cartoon version always stuck with my 5 year old self that the various leaders immediately sided with one another only when the goblins were at the gates.

(I actually give Tolkien props for the fact that instead of the dwarves being money grubbing gold-lovers like certain stereotypes--it's actually elves, humans, AND dwarves who are greedy sons of bitches)

I also feel like even the treatment of the goblins is softer in The Hobbit than in LOTR. Yes, they're the bad guys but the dwarves and Gandalf murdered their king. They did so because the king was justifiably upset they were carrying around Hate Crime SwordsTM. How would you react?

Indeed, I think this is probably why the Hobbit movies utterly failed for me because the movies lacked any sort of subversive quality to them. It feels weird to read the Hobbit as subversive since it predates modern fantasy as we know it but even then, it was the story of the rotund middle aged useless gentryman instead of the plucky farm boy.

Anyway, HAPPY HOBBIT DAY!",fantasy
Epigraphs from our world,Does anyone else view them with pure hate? I love little world building touches with them using in-world sources.

Looking for book reccs!,"So I’m looking for a fantasy book with good world building a good plot but most. importantly. An angry female main character!!okay so hear me out, I say this because right now I’m reading the never night trilogy by Kristoff. So it’s definitely not perfect but I realized what has been drawing me so much into the book is its main female character Mia. Yeah she’s not a good person (no spoilers ofc) but what I’ve realized is I love reading the book because for once in a fantasy book the main female protagonist isn’t some damsel in distress clutching her fucking pearls and crying all the time. Like she’s badass and cut throat. I neeeed fantasy series with this type of protagonist. It’s what i’m missing from my life!! Some other examples would be denearys targaryean but this is not an invitation to recommend me a song of fire and ice cause I refuse to read it for reasons i’m not gonna mention!

Short horror fiction ,"Please tell me your favorite horror or sci fi horror short fiction you can count novellas and limit it to your top five and maybe detail one or two with analysis 
I will start
Lets go with Laird Barron Hallugenia is so good because it feels like getting lost on a road with many dead ends the plot has so many well told stories within the main thru line it's genius 
I was never a Lovecraft fan but early barron work like this clearly works off that Lovecraft mythos and brings a modern spin
I can reread the private investigator visit to the one twin in prison part of the narrative a dozen times and each reading I find new horror to ponder 
The ending is bleak as most of his stories tend to be but the main character is identifiable as someone beset by this evil force and ultimately is literally swallowed up by it 
Horrific suspenseful and CREEPY will reread again soon 
Also his character who hightails it as the end deserves his own book that's how good the supporting roles are in this one ",fantasy

"Do I not actually like Fantasy? Or have I just read the ""wrong"" books for me","I'm getting back into reading after a few years' break. Have read a few recommendations from friends of what's good and popular lately, and none of them have clicked. I could say ""they're fine, just super not for me.""

Tainted Cup, Blacktongue Thief, The Midnight Library (although this one I will stand by)

Even before my break, I read and disliked First Law (I actually *really* liked book one, but the later two totally lost me). I read and loved Locke Lamora but burnt out midway through book 2 and haven't gone back. I've dabbled in Sanderson but his style is also not my cup of tea. Tried Gideon the Ninth, the tone grated me. Would never touch Maas or romantasy with a ten foot pole. And I feel like I'd dislike Kingkiller for the same reason I dislike First Law.

I adore the Green Bone Saga which I've seen a number of people express isn't real fantasy because it lacks many of the fantasy staples and conventions.

I love ASOIAF - but I also loved Wheel of Time, until I began a reread a decade later and learned it does not grab my attention like it used to.

I find myself wanting to like the fantasy books I don't (minus Midnight Library, I stand by disliking that), because most people do, because I can see WHY most people do. But if I don't like the fantasy darlings, the genre staples... do I even like fantasy at all? The premises grab me, on paper it's all stuff I SHOULD love, but I actually sit down to read it and it just... doesn't grab me.

Am I just reading fantasy wrong? Or is this a case of ""no, you don't like fantasy, you just like the idea of it, but there's probably better genres for you out there?"" (I do unironically read a lot of classics). I know I'm not super well read in the genre, and I have tons TBR on my shelf, but I've got to imagine there's more for me out there than Jade City and Locke Lamora. 

I want to like Fantasy - where am I going wrong? What books am I missing that might be more my speed?

EDIT: Please stop recommending Lord of the Rings. I don't like quests and adventure and travelling, it was my biggest beef with First Law book 2 as well as Blacktongue",fantasy
Reading Licanius and The Faithful and the Fallen in a mad dash: my impressions of each series.,"During the past year I read both series in a mad dash. I had always seen them recommended in the usual booktube fantasy channels, but I hadn’t actually picked them up until I found the first volume of each in a BOGO sale at B&amp;N. Reading each volume’s first book quickly escalated and soon I found myself buying the rest of the series and finishing each in a heartbeat. So here are my impressions:

 



Licanius:

 

This is a sort of Jordan lovechild. It has a heavy focus on magic and is very lore heavy. The tone is somewhat classic, more towards the 90s and I got to empathize and root for the characters. They were relatively one dimensional, though. Except the series favorite Caeden.

I thought the series was confusing, especially with the plethora of terms relating to how the magic operated as well as the intricacies of the plot. There were parts where I felt more frustrated than when reading a Malazan book.

IMO the main time loop plot was resolved masterfully. And it felt like a fine denouement. The problem is that it feels like Islington threw all the meat there and he had to sacrifice everything else.  &gt;!Secondary characters get all tossed aside!&lt;; secondary plots get abandoned. This is the first and only book where I’ve read a postscript apologizing and explaining a very slapdash deus ex machina. But overall, it’s a decent series if you’re the heavy magic system type of reader.

 

Faithful and the Fallen:

 

Incredibly fast paced and emotional, with characters that have a lot of heart worth rooting for.

I thought Gwynne masterfully achieves a stylistic combination that I hadn’t seen before.  A chosen one / plot coupon classic tale mixed with that kind of stabby, hold the door, barbarians at the gate fantasy. Like Tad Williams mixed with David Gemmell. It does have a veneer of Martin’s type of worldbuilding, violence and stakes, but it’s IMO relatively thin.

As the rhythm is frenetic, you end in a mad dash to reach the conclusion of each book. However, I don’t think that Gemmell’s style of fantasy works that well with long books. That’s why it feels like Gwynne drags the plot, establishes a long cat-and-mouse game and provides his bad guys of heavy armor, so I don’t think the entirety of the four books (a million words, more less) were justified.

If you have an eye for detail, you may be bothered by the demographics of the Banished Lands. The place has keeps and small villages, but to my knowledge no great cities. Where do these warring kingdoms get enough personnel to support thousand strong armies with such high casualty rates?

In the end, I hadn’t read a series that I consider the definition of pure, unadulterated FUN. And that’s it. It’s not complex, it’s not groundbreaking. It mixes traditions well and definitely takes you for a ride, but I loved the experience. Worth reading it.",fantasy
Book/series recommendations for fantasy rooted in church/christianity as a theme,"Anyone read or know of any books or series of fantasy where the church and or Christianity are a feature? I was told about the spirit ring which I’m yet to read but it seems like the kind of thing I’m looking for

Will it be okay for me to dive straight into this book without having read any other books from the riftwar cycle, or will I likely struggle to keep up?",fantasy
Fourth Wing complaint,"I’m only 100 pages into Iron Flame so please no spoilers for the second book!

This is not another Fourth Wing hate post. I actually enjoyed the book for the most part, but I have a specific complaint about Violet.

She feels so betrayed by Xaden not being honest with her, while his concern about Dain actually comes to fruition? Like Resson happened BECAUSE Xaden was right. Violet couldn’t be trusted with more information, not because she was not trustworthy, but because of her proximity to Dain. If Xaden had been honest with her about everything, Dain would have seen it all &amp; they would all be dead.

I’m having trouble enjoying Iron Flame because I’m just so frustrated with Violet. Xaden is willing to tell her everything that doesn’t put people’s lives at risk, and that’s not enough for her. She doesn’t even seem to be trying to get better at shielding either.

She’s coming off as super selfish &amp; short-sighted. Going to continue reading because I love all of the other characters, but Violet is getting more unlikable with every page.

Just wanted to see if anyone else shared this frustration. Again, pls no spoilers for the second book!",fantasy
"Neither Have I Wings, by Alice Degan (False Doctrine series) (Bingo review 15/25)","In ""[From All False Doctrine](https://primeideal.dreamwidth.org/142613.html),"" Charlie Boult is a teenage car thief from the mean streets of Toronto, who's in the process of changing his ways and becomes an acolyte at Kit Underhill's church. In the last couple chapters, everyone (including Charlie) witnesses a miraculous event, and then has to deal with ""how do we go back to our normal lives after we've just seen this.""

""Neither Have I Wings"" picks up twenty years later, as World War II is wrapping up in Europe. Charlie is an air force pilot stationed in Yorkshire; the other POV character, Evgenia (""Evvie"") is volunteering at a hospital for recovering amputees. But one day, the police come by investigating a murder, and Evgenia is curious about the mystery; meanwhile, Charlie discovers something very strange hidden in the outbuilding, and all of the sudden he's back in the world of demons and miracles...

""From All False Doctrine"" was a slow burn with a lot of wrong-genre savvy. ""Neither Have I Wings"" is brisker, faster-paced, and Charlie's plotline in particular is clearly supernatural from chapter one. Points for ""Wings."" (The title comes from a folksong called ""The Water Is Wide."" It's funny because Charlie is an airplane pilot. And angels sometimes have wings. Get it?) Evvie's, however, is a mix of ""I've had supernatural visions in my life before so I'm primed to suspect miraculous events even on very weak evidence,"" and laser-guided amnesia, which leads to more ""this is suppposed to be a fantasy book but a lot of it is a comedy of manners.""

At first it seems like a legit standalone sequel--for the most part, you don't really need to know what happened with Kit, just that it was a miracle in the midst of Charlie's otherwise-mundane life. But towards the second half, as more characters get introduced and others get re-introduced, I was more appreciative that I'd read ""False Doctrine"" first, I'm not sure the entire thing would work on its own.

In ""False Doctrine,"" Peachy tells lots of lies about him and Kit avoiding military service in WWI. It turns out that Kit volunteering put Peachy to shame, and he's uncomfortable with this, so he just lies and Kit rolls with it. But when Peachy is confronted by demonic forces, his hero-worship of Kit turns unhealthy--on some level, he wants to be Kit. Charlie takes this kind of hero-worship in a different direction; Kit served in WWI, so he'll serve in WWII. He is admirably honest with himself in a way that Peachy couldn't be. But the gap between the impossible ideal of goodness Kit represents to both of them, and their own flawed selves, is still there. Meanwhile, a completely different character turns out to be lying about almost everything in her life. I can understand a need for secrecy, there is a war going on, but the completely over-the-top frivolous details seem more distracting than helpful. She couldn't possibly have come from the Peverell Peacham school of Blatant Lies...unless...??

This was recced as subverting the friends-to-lovers trope, inasmuch as Charlie and Evvie are friends but don't become each other's lovers. I would caveat that, while their paths cross briefly early on, it takes a long time for them to actually interact with each other as friends. Their plotlines run parallel but don't directly intersect for a while (which makes for some funny moments when I realized how a couple minor characters were related).

Like ""False Doctrine,"" ""Wings"" is very positive/optimistic about Christianity (specifically Anglo-Catholicism, and here also Greek Orthodoxy) and the power of God's love to overcome human prejudice and fear. ""False Doctrine"" featured two hetero love stories against the social conventions of 1925. ""Wings"" is far less heteronormative, and has more emphasis on the terrible things that can be done in the name of religion (including a character who's either the greatest or worst example of nominative determinism, you'll have to keep reading to find out which).

Charlie's plotline might feel a little too sweetness-and-light at times, things are not going to be easy with or without supernatural beings in the mix, and after the author makes a pretty powerful statement about love and commitment, trying to increase the tension by being all ""what if it was just a lie"" comes off as ""[Like You Would Really Do It](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt)""/""[Unfortunate Implications](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications)."" But in the long run, after some grief and pain, we can infer it's going to be a case of Earn Your Happy Ending.

Evvie's plotline was harder for me to make sense of. I could understand a case of ""I know what I'm called to do in life, other people might not understand, but that's okay;"" I could also have seen it as ""I thought I knew what I was meant to do, but meeting people from different walks of life has opened my mind to different possibilities, and now I see how I might be able to serve God in a different vocation."" What we got instead was a late swerve followed by a quick unswerve, and that didn't seem to resolve anything. Fic potential?

This book :handshake: Amina al-Sirafi :handshake: A Master of Djinn

What if we found the mystical artifact King Solomon used to control angels and demons. Solomon is having a moment!

This book is also very much cut from the same mold as ""[To Say Nothing Of The Dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1dmqm6p/to_say_nothing_of_the_dog_by_connie_willis_oxford/)."" Keeping calm and carrying on in the war, aspiring to be cool detectives like Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, criticizing architecture that's trying to look medieval but is actually just Victorian pseudo-medieval...The Anglicans know what they're about.

There's a running joke about ""angel wings need to change color to match the liturgical calendar,"" and like, I am very much part of the niche target audience this was targeted at. And if you think this is very amusing:

&gt;“It’s hilarious. Perhaps I won’t be court-martialled for desertion after all. Perhaps I’ll hang for murder instead.”

&gt;“Desertion?” Hal looked serious now. “You are absent without leave? You did not tell me that.”

&gt;“I wasn’t sure you’d understand.”

&gt;“Of course I understand,” said Hal. “I am myself essentially a soldier.”

&gt;Charlie hadn’t thought about it that way. “Right. But you couldn’t exactly desert, could you?”

&gt;Hal opened his eyes very wide. “Is that what you think? Your theology is very defective. Of course I could.”

&gt;“Oh. Free will. Yeah, I did know that.”

then you might be also. ;)

Bingo: Criminals (not a major emphasis but Charlie is an expert car thief), Dreams (and how), Prologues/Epilogues, Self/Indie Published, Romance, Multi-POV (including the prologue/epilogues), Disabled Character (neither of the POVs but a fairly prominent character and several minor ones--they are at a rehabilitation facility.)",fantasy

The sword of Kaigen ,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book; every character was being developed at least in most pasty’s until Chull-hee joined the picture and then Mamorous other two friends fell off. 

I’m not entirely sure what the point the author was trying to make by killing off Mamorou after just having had a break through growth with that character, I was thoroughly disappointed with that. 

Then we transition from a decent fantasy novel about a boy growing up in traditional fantasy Japanese culture trying to become someone who can create the whispering blade and make his dad proud to just being killed off; after which the books transitions to his moms point of view entirely becoming some weird mix between a romance and fantasy novel with two grown adults who can’t communicate with the last chapter being some type of Twilight Esq love triangle.

What's the worst place to start with your favorite author?,"Not because it's the middle of a universe, but because you think the work itself doesnt do them justice in some way: it's not their usual setting, least interesting characters, way too experimental, etc.

Last year I worked on reading the full works of a few of my favorite authors and was surprised that even the most skilled who I thought could do no wrong had written some things that, had I read them first, would have never made them my favorites. Daniel Abraham and NK Jemisin are my top two favorite authors. But I think Abraham's Kithamar series (so far) is the least interesting world he's ever written and Jemisin's Great Cities duology has the least endearing characters of all her work. I'd have never read the Broken Earth series if I'd tried Great Cities first and that a shame that would have been!

By the same coin, I've been put off Mercedes Lackey because the Arrows of the Queen trilogy was just too saccharine and VE Schwab because I thought most of the characters in A Darker Shade of Magic were annoying. But maybe those are just the books by those authors that least match my taste and I started in the wrong place!",fantasy
Watch Yatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master if you like court intrigue ,"Yatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master is an anime that just finished its run and I thought it had a really nice story with well crafted characters that felt like a breath of fresh air.

The synopsis:

In the Kingdom of Yamauchi, people have the ability to transform into three-legged crows known as yatagarasu. While the men plot over daily governance, women compete for the hand of Wakamiya, the crown prince who was selected as the Kinu, the servant to the Mountain God. Four young women arrive at the court to join the competition, including one named Asebi.

While the kind and innocent Asebi sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the other women, the crown prince has to fight for his place in the clan. Despite being born both to a concubine and as a second son, the royal priests still chose Wakamiya to be the Kinu over his older brother. This decision created a rift between the siblings while enraging Wakamiya's stepmother in the process.

When Yukiya, one of the teenage sons of the village chief, is sent to the palace to become Wakamiya's new attendant, the prince is not pleased in the slightest. However, Yukiya's presence at the imperial courts is no mere coincidence.



\[Written by MAL Rewrite\]

The world building is interesting ( The world is constantly being explored and expanded on without a lot of exposition dump.), there is a large cast of characters without many feeling stale ( Most of them have their own plans, agendas, personalities, etc ), and the plot is engaging ( The plot is layered and for the most part well thought out).

There isn’t a lot of action as it’s mostly court intrigue but the synopsis only covers the first half/first arc of the show. 

It kind of reminded me of The Twelve Kingdoms by Fuyumi Ono, so if you liked that I’d recommend giving this a shot.

I have read Malazan, LOTR, lots of Sanderson, some Robin Hobb, some N.K. Jemisin, Patrick Rothfuss, GRR Martin, Robert Jackson Benett etc. Also, Percy Jackson, Amari, Fablehaven etc in MG.

Books with asian female protagonist,"\[Repost bc it got taken down for academic subject but my request is about book recs more than schoolwork. I just love good asian fantasy recs and take inspo for my thesis\]

  
Hi, I'm looking for recs, especially in fantasy/historical fantasy, with female asian protagonists (especially Chinese or Japanese). I already read The Poppy War which is one of my corpus books and I'm looking for other kind of protagonists, like possibly more moral, caring or positive (not the ""I kill everyone for my goal protagonist), but still strong or rebelling against a system. Idk if what I'm asking is really clear.  
It could be from any kind of book (Novel, short novel, manga...). Don't hesitate if you have recs of younger litt, I know The poppy war is adult but I'm also open to adolescent book. 

If it's possible to explain why the character works for my request (and which character of the book if it's not the protagonist) that would be perfect :)

Some of the recs I've got in my other post and seemed good : A thousand beggenings and endings, Descendant of the Crane/Strike the Zither (from the same author), Daughter of the moon goddess, A magic steeped in poison, The singing hills series, The magnolia sword, Sword of Kaigen (though it's maybe a little too ""adult"" for what I'm looking since I already have an adult fantasy book.

Anyone read The Dragon in Winter by Jonathan Maberry,"Recently finished this series and boy was this last book a sloggg. I enjoyed Kagan The Damned but the first half was hard to get through. I thought the second book was great and snappy and I finished it really quickly. The action and world building was deep and you got a good sense of how old the world was. 

This third book was a hard swallow. It felt like majority of the book was just TELLING you things instead of showing. Two or more characters sitting around recounting stuff that's happened off screen or musing over the history of the world. Which I like, I love hearing about characters talk about what was in books but the chapters were so short and it was almost impossible to settle into a scene before you were off somewhere else. 

Maberry is a good writer and I can't say the book was rushed because it was so long. When it finally kicks into gear in the very last part it's good and moves quickly and flows well but there's something about the way Maberry writes his downtime that really grates on my attention span. 

I also felt like the twist at the end was horrible &gt;!and took so much away from what you THOUGHT was the motives of the main villain. I think it really lessens the impact of the previous to books and left me wondering why I'd spent so much time listening to this person talk about how he was scorned only for it to not be the person you think the whole time. !&lt;",fantasy
Have any of y'all seen Dwarves of Dragon Mountain?,"I just watched it on Prime and it was actually pretty decent. The concept was really interesting imo. Dwarves with like early 1900s(?) tech get trapped in a mine. They try to find their way out and discover there's something else down there with them. It's basically a drama but with dwarves. It's a little schlocky, but definitely watchable.",fantasy

“Hyborian Africa” (1980) &amp; “To Kush and Beyond: The Black Kingdoms of the Hyborian Age” (1980) by Charles R. Saunders,"&gt; South of Stygia are the vast black kingdoms of the Amazons, the Kushites, the Atlaians and the hybrid empire of Zembabwe.

- Robert E. Howard, [""The Hyborian Age""](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42182/42182-h/42182-h.htm)

The Hyborian Age of Conan the Cimmerian was no mythical white space, occupied only by pale Caucasians. In formulating the adventures of the Cimmerian, Robert E. Howard drew on everything he knew: Conan's travels encompass not just a fantasy geography, but chronologies and genres. The barbarian might find himself leading a battle of European-style medieval knights; on the deck of a ship whose pirates could have stepped out of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island; in a frontier wilderness fort reminiscent of pioneer Texas; in a stone temple that might have stood in some fantastic vision of ancient Egypt—and in a fantasy equivalent of Africa, populated by Black people, who were to Conan friends, allies, enemies, and lovers.

The Conan stories, while fantasy and aimed at Weird Tales, grew out of Howard's love for history and adventure fiction, and writing historical adventure stories for magazines like Oriental Stories. The conceit of the Hyborian Age is that by setting it before any known period, Howard had a free hand to invent details that would otherwise trip him up if trying to write a realistic historical yarn. 

For pulps like Adventure, accuracy was paramount; the magazine prided itself on publishing stories from people who knew their subject, who had gone out and lived in exotic lands, and returned to tell the tale. To that end, Adventure invited readers to write in with their questions, for Adventure's stable of writers to answer. In September 2024, scholar Patrice Louinet came across a letter printed in a copy of Adventure (30 December 1923):

&gt; **White Man and Native of West Africa**
&gt; 
&gt; HAUSAS—trading-factory terms—marriage ceremonies and customs:
&gt; 
&gt; Question:—”I am writing to get some information in regard to the customs, habits, etc., of the natives of that part of Africa which is included in your section in ‘Ask Adventure.’
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Are the natives of a war-like stock? That is, did they come from a fighting race?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) How much authority does the superintendent of a trading-post possess?
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Do the whites interfere with the natives in dealing with native criminals?
&gt; 
&gt; 4) What are some of the punishments of native wrong-doers by the whites? By the natives themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; 5) What are some marriage customs among the natives? Am I right in supposing a native has full power to punish his wife in any way he pleases?
&gt; 
&gt; 6) Have the morals of the African natives been raised by the rule of the white men or have they decreased in standard?
&gt; 
&gt; 7) Is the ceremony of Mumbo-Jumbo—or something of some name like that—for the correcting of disobedient women used in that part of Africa? If so, how is it carried out?
&gt; 
&gt; 8) What is the customary costume of the natives?
&gt; 
&gt; I apologize for asking so many questions, but I am very much interested in Africa. If by any chance this letter should be published in Adventure, please do not print my name.

- R.E.H., Cross Plains, Texas.

Text from [REH.world](https://reh.world/howardworks/otherpulps/adventure-december-1923/).

This would be Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas—and if the questions of a 17-year-old boy seem somewhat ignorant, it must be remembered that knowledge of Africa was by no means widespread in the rural United States during the 1920s and 30s. For many years and even decades to come, Africa would be the metaphorical ""dark continent,"" whose peoples, geography, and history were intermixed with fantasy, racism, and plain ignorance. Howard's questions were honest ones, and it is to his credit that he sought out answers instead of immediately falling back to stereotypes and fantasy when he wrote his first few African stories.

The Conan boom in the 1960s and 70s brought with it not just an increased admiration for Robert E. Howard as a writer and Conan the Cimmerian as a character, but new criticism and new sensibilities. As Marvel Comics adapted Howard's character and stories to a new medium, they had to face the reality that this was a new world: the Civil Rights movement had won victories with the decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education (1954) and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Black Pride and other movements raised awareness of the roots of the African diaspora in the United States and surrounding countries.

Adaption to this new reality was, at first, slow. [“The Vale of Lost Women”](https://deepcuts.blog/2020/06/10/the-vale-of-lost-women1967-by-robert-e-howard/) (1967) by Robert E. Howard is one example of how 1930s stereotypes and prejudice found an unwelcome audience in the 1960s and 70s, and how later writers and artists worked to make this work acceptable to a contemporary audience of all races. Not every creator was so conscientious; in 1975, Black fan Charles R. Saunders wrote [""Die Black Dog! A Look At Racism in Fantasy Literature.""](https://web.archive.org/web/20220120041941/http://reindeermotel.com/CHARLES/charles_blog42_dieblackdog.html) While it was one thing for something Robert E. Howard, who died in 1936 and never lived to see the changes in US society, to rely on racial stereotypes the essay specifically called out latter-day creators of Conan pastiche for continuing to use such lazy and biased storytelling nearly four decades later.

Just because Charles R. Saunders called out writers of heroic fantasy doesn't mean he stepped away from the genre; quite the opposite. In 1980, Saunders published two related essays: ""Hyborian Africa"" was published in the fanzine *Paragon* #1 (May 1980), and ""To Kush and Beyond: The Black Kingdoms of the Hyborian Age"" was published in *Savage Sword of Conan* #56 (Sep 1980). Both essays deal with similar subject matter: an exploration of the ""Black Kingdoms"" mentioned in Howard's essay ""The Hyborian Age,"" references to which are sprinkled throughout Conan's adventures. However, the purpose and approach of each essay is different.

&gt; The historical derivation of the lands south of Stygia, the Black Kingdoms, are less obvious. Nonetheless, a look at any reference work on African history quickly exposes Howard's inspirations for the names of some of his Black Kingdoms, if not their cultural backgrounds [.] Kush, Punt, Darfar, Zembabwei and Amazon are names as familiar to African scholars as those of Poland, France, Spain and Italy are to students of the European past.

- Charles R. Saunders, ""Hyborian Africa,"" Paragon #1 (1980), 27 

""Hyborian Africa"" looks at the historical sources and inspiration behind Howard's stories. Given that this was a fanzine and that Howard studies was in its infancy, the usual apparatus of scholarly writing is neither present nor expected: no footnotes, no bibliography. However, Saunders' care in the article is evident. He addresses only the stories written by Robert E. Howard, not later pastiches or derivative material from the Marvel comic books. It is brief, at only a little over two pages, but the history offered is largely accurate...and if Saunders criticizes some of Howard's depictions of these fantasy versions of African kingdoms, he also offers a parting observation:

&gt; Although Howard's depictions of Hyborian Age blacks consisted primarily of stock racist stereotypes, he did do more research into African history than such contemporaries as Edgar Rice Burroughs. Even today, the mention of the wor[d] ""Kush' would draw only blank stares from most people. With the exception of Darfar, Howard's historical foundations for his Black Kingdoms were as solid as those of the rest of Conan's world. And this is to his credit.

- Charles R. Saunders, ""Hyborian Africa,"" Paragon #1 (1980), 29

""To Kush and Beyond: The Black Kingdoms of the Hyborian Age"" was published as a literary exploration of the Black Kingdoms as they appear in the broader Conan mythology, which includes not just Howard's stories but also stories that were completed or re-written by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter like ""Hawks over Shem,"" ""The Snout in the Dark,"" and ""The City of Skulls."" In adapting Conan stories to comics, Marvel had included some of de Camp and Carter's creations, including Conan's ally Juma the Kushite, and so Saunders incorporates that lore into his survey of the Black Kingdoms of the Hyborian Age. Saunders' work provided an explanation and codification of lore on the world of Conan that both readers and writers could reference.

Being published in a comics magazine, Saunders' essay was illustrated by Conan artists John Buscema and Gene Day, and being of a scholarly character includes a page of endnote citations, for a total of 7 pages. Saunders' interest in African history is still present, though less explicit. In the closing paragraph, for example, he writes:

&gt; The cataclysm that formed the outlinees of the modern world separated the land south of the River Styx from the rest of the world, and raised up from the sea the entire west coast of what is now Africa. Much of the history and lore of the Black Kingdoms perished in the disaster—yet the Black Kingdoms did not truly die. Kush, Darfar and Punt rose again in historical times, and the West African Kingdom of Dahomey boasted a formidable corps of Amazon warriors. Like so many other nations and races, the African can trace their history ""back into the mists of the forgotten Hyborian Age….""

- Charles R. Saunders, Savage Sword of Conan #56 (1980), 54

While the two essays have very different purposes, considered together gives the sense that Charles R. Saunders wasn't just chronicling the lore of the Hyborian world and glossing it to make it fit. Saunders was studying the work of Howard and other writers to see how they used Black characters and African history in their stories, for good or for ill—and he used those lessons when he wrote his own fiction, the kind of heroic fantasy series that he wanted to read.

Saunders combined his interests in African history and heroic fantasy in his own fiction, including the Dossouye stories about fantasy warrior-women that were first published in the anthology Amazons! (1979), and the Nyumbani setting stories that feature his hero Imaro—who would star in Saunder's first novel, Imaro (1981). These are the critical early stories of Sword &amp; Soul (see Milton J. Davis' [A Sword and Soul Primer](https://www.miltonjdavis.com/post/a-sword-and-soul-primer) ), and they represent a desire to look beyond what other people have written to what stories have not been written, that need to be written, and to write them.

""Hyborian Africa"" has not been reprinted. ""To Kush and Beyond"" has been reprinted in the Savage Sword of Conan Omnibus vol. 4.

Suggestions for the defining books in fantasy for a reading journey,"Hey fantasy readers. I'm trying to create a reading journey for myself touching the defining points in the fantasy genre. I know, I big task!

There seem to be points in fantasy where a book or series emerges and the genre shifts in the direction or creates a whole new offshoot. For example, A Game of Thrones seems to be the first of the grim dark genre, and Joe Abercrombie took it in another direction. Perhaps a bad example but I hope you know what I mean.

The staples of the genre, but moving through time I guess is what I want.

So the ideas I'm throwing around is

1950's - Lord of the Ring and The Once and Future King

1960's - Dune

1970's - The Princess Bride and Thomas Covenant

1980's - The Book of the New Sun, Riftwar Saga and The Black Company.

1990's Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, Robin Hobb and Malazan

2000's Mistborn and First Law

2010's Broken Earth and Stormlight

I have picked the decade the first book was published but I appreciate some of these cover decades. I think Thomas Covernant's last book was in the 2010's?

I might read Brando Sando Mistborn and Stormlight together.

I also haven't included children's books such as The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Northern Lights, or Harry Potter, because I have a five-year-old and I'm saving it for them. Perhaps I will do a new journey for us to go through for us in a few years.

Also, I just read the Dark Tower extended universe so I don't want to dip into that again just yet and don't get me started on the Kingkiller. I'll wait to reread these when/if book three comes out.

So my question is, what am I missing and is there anything I can cut? And should I change the order? Would Robin Hobb sit better in the 2000's?

I completely understand that there will be many interpretations to the question but I'm looking for input from people more experienced with the genre. I have read some of the books above but I want to reread to feel the genre shift over time.

Thanks for your help!",fantasy

Recommend me books with lots of overarching mysteries,"**I don't want episodic mysteries.**

The more unanswered questions and mysteries, the better.

The genre can be anything, since One Piece has a lot of mysteries even though it’s not classified as a mystery series. I want something with lots of overarching mysteries that are constantly foreshadowed, hinted at, or expanded upon—where simple mysteries become more complex as they connect to other mysteries. I also love it when new mysteries are constantly being introduced.

Example:

Harry Potter (novel)",fantasy

Joe Abercrombie Apprehension,"Hi all!
Short time lurker first time poster. 
2024 has been the year I got back into reading after *almost* never reading for pleasure beyond the Harry Potter series many years ago. 

I’m about 40 books deep and have had great experiences and some lackluster ones. 

I’m finishing up my current book (Malice by John Gwynne) soon and trying to decide what to read next. I’ve had The Blade Itself on my shelf but keep putting it off because I’m afraid of the hype. 

When getting into fantasy all I saw was Sanderson as a “first step”, and unfortunately I’ve been very let down by him. Based off of who I’ve liked and disliked, will Joe Abercrombie be a good fit for me?

Authors I have loved:
Stephen King
John Gwynne
Evan Winter
GRRM
Robin Hobb
Scott Lynch

Authors I’ve been Disappointed In:
Brandon Sanderson
Naomi Novik
Leigh Bardugo

The thing I value most is good characterization. The biggest letdown for Brando for me was his lack of characterization. His plotting is excellent and his books always end on a high, but his characters felt fake to me. And dude seriously needs an editor. I’ve read 4 of his books now and each one would have been much better if they were 200-300 pages shorter for my tastes. 

I know the simple answer is to just read it. But I just keep picking up something else because I’m afraid of not liking it. I want to like him so badly because he’s got a largish catalogue and I want to be a part of the hype haha

Thanks all!

EDIT: Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments! Y’all have convinced me. I should’ve clarified in the post, but I tend to read 2 series at once: one by myself, and one with my partner. I’m reading Malice by myself and do plan on reading that series to its conclusion because I’m REALLY enjoying it. My partner and I just wrapped up Way of Kings and want to swerve on Brando, so yall have convinced me/us to start The Blade Itself next! Thanks again!

EDIT 2: my partner and I are 100 pages into The Blade Itself and we’re loving it! Thanks all!",fantasy
"Jam Reads: The Bayern Agenda, by Dan Moren","https://preview.redd.it/1er358z0i6qd1.jpg?width=264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50d66b7879764cbc29a31dddeb397a2fd786dde8

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/the-bayern-agenda-the-galactic-cold-war-1-by-dan-moren)

*The Bayern Agenda* is the first novel in the spy-fi thriller series *The Galactic Cold War*, written by Dan Moren, and published by Angry Robot Books. A story full of intrigue and subterfuge, set in the backdrop of a galactic cold war between two superpowers (The Illyrican Empire and the Commonwealth of Independent Services); a book with an excellent cast of characters, tons of fun and banter, a well-layered mystery, and nostalgia for the Golden Age of spies films.

We will be following Simon Kovalic, a covert operative for the Commonwealth, while he's trying to understand the ties between the Illyrican Empire and the Bayern Corporation; an unexpected incident during a mission forces his ex-wife, Lt Commander Taylor, to take control over his undercover team in this new task that will try to avoid the escalation of the conflict between the two superpowers.  
Told from two POV, Kovalic's one and the recently incorporated Eli Brody, we will be thrown into a world of conspiracy and political intrigue, and where many questions' answers will only come with a new one thing to investigate attached; all while trying to not blow their undercover identities and alert the Illyrican powers of their intentions.

While it's true that the story is limited to two POVs, Moren does an excellent job at painting a full portrait of the undercover team, a group of individuals which feel as a family under the command of Kovalic and Taylor. There's a certain tension between Kovalic and Taylor due to their past, but they appreciate each other; Brody is new to this world, and compensates insecurity with boldness, and Trapper might be the perfect definition of a cold but good character. Page is complicated, as his role will become the more complex in the whole operation. The banter between the members of the team is delicious, helping many times to ease the tension that is intrinsical to the own undercover mission, while making you laugh; they are not only coworkers, but also care about the others.

As itself, this novel is a bit slower than I would have expected, taking certain pauses to further develop the past of our characters and to explain the necessary things about the world. However, Moren manages to keep the tension alongside the plot, creating more situations that require an answer from the characters, going about the subterfuge and the intrigue related to the mission.  
The worldbuilding has touches of science-fiction, but it remembers more to the classic spies films, including gadgets and crappy technology that fail at the worst moment. Particularly, I found interesting the concept of the Bayern Corporation itself, as it adds a bit more of spice to this world.

*The Bayern Agenda* is, definitely, a fun and thrilling read, perfect for those that like spy-fi stories with an extra touch of found family inside. I enjoyed it much, so it's a must continue with *The Galactic Cold War* series. ",fantasy
Epic fantasy with good romance? ,"Ok so this might be a bit specific but please hear me out. I’m a huge fan of epic fantasy and I especially love ASOIAF. What I’m looking for is a book with a similar vibe - political intrigue, plot twists that will have you speechless, lots of characters, complex worldbuilding etc - BUT I would also love to read a good romance subplot. It doesn’t have to be heavily focused on romance (I’m looking for a epic fantasy series and that’s the priority) but I’d like to read of some well developed romance as well, preferibly slow burn that makes you question if they will ever get together. I’d LOVE if it was enemies to lovers with a very SLOW BURN where you don’t even know how they could ever turn out to be a couple. For example I would really enjoy if one the characters started to have feelings for the villain, like a forbidden romance. Of course, it has to be well written.

For example, I adore epic fantasy like The Stormlight Archives but I absolutely hate how Sanderson handles the romance aspect of the book - of course he’s an amazing writer and the romance is just a really irrelevant aspect compared to the complex work he has written, still I think he could have given some more depth to it. I don’t even feel like there is chemistry between the main couple.

I’m not sure if I’m asking for too much since no book has satisfied me fully in having BOTH the fantasy world and epic storyline I’m looking for AND some captivating romance to read, but I’m still fairly new to the genre so maybe there’s some hidden gem I haven’t heard about :)

ALSO, please DON’T recommend me books like ACOTAR/Fourth Wings since I tried with them and hated them, they’re not even epic fantasy to begin with and the romance is cringy and poorly executed (don’t want anyone to get offended, it’s just my opinion). 
Generally speaking, what I’m looking for it’s preferibly not a YA. I want something darker, more mature and generally on the same level (I know it’s hard to find but maybe something similar) as George R.R Martin or Sanderson in terms of worlbuilding, plot, writing etc.

"Finished ""The Shepherd's Crown"", the epilogue hit me hard","The book went from good to exceptional with the epilogue.

I think Tiffany Aching is his best work.  She's such a well developed and realized character.  We've all been her age at some point and faced many of her same challenges.  Many of us have kids in our life whether as parents, siblings, aunts, uncles or cousins and we'd be lucky if they all grew up with the confidence, heart, intelligence, empathy, and self perspective as Tiffany.  The beauty of this series is she has all those and she also questions and doubts her self too like any well adjusted person.

So we get to the epilogue and it is a perfect ending, even if its not the ending I want.  I want more, I want to see her grow up and become Granny to others, but we know it cannot happen.  So we're left wiping away happy tears as we see Tiffany grow up and figure out what she wants, we see her start to make a life for herself and all we can do is hope the children in our life turn out like her.",fantasy

What character are you in your secret heart or your head?,"Ok so I play D&amp;D so I get to play heroic characters and although I've tried all types I always default to good. Then generally when I read, although I enjoy criminals and heists, I tend to side with the guards etc. I guess I'm never going to be a rogue in my heart. In my dreams I tend to protect the people around me even though in real life I'm not a fighter at all Id rather walk away fuming than have conflict.

So in my secret heart I think I'm a paladin a warrior for good, not necessarily religious but happy to stand up and protect or make the ultimate sacrifice for others.

Went to a Fantasy Festival and now looking for opinions on (and recommendations for) these authors!,"There was an event here in Denmark last weekend called the Fantasy Festival, and I went one of the days and had a really good time. There were four international authors present, and as I do all my reading in English I'm now super curious about their books. 

Evelyn Skye - I went to her talk, and was really intrigued by the premise of some of her books. She was super sweet and fun as well.

Taran Matharu - I sadly missed out on his talk, but he interviewed Evelyn Skye in the talk I went to, and they had a nice back and forth and he seemed like a really interesting author too.

Ryan Cahill - Again, I missed his talk, but from everything I heard about him at the event, his books seem right up my alley. 

Angie Sage - I also didn't attend her talk, but it seems her books are mostly intended for kids anyways? I thought I'd still include her here though as I don't mind reading books for a younger audience if they still hold up for adults.

Really I'm just curious as I'd never heard of these authors before (except of course I now realise that Evelyn Skye is the author behind Damsel on Netflix, and I randomly came across some of Ryan Cahill's books at the library a couple days ago) so have you guys read any of their books before?

What are some modern epic fantasy series that feature lengthy quests?,"Something I’ve noticed about many modern fantasy series is that a lot of the story is centred around or confined to one location, or a couple of locations. Some examples I’ve read are Stormlight, Mistborn, Senlin Ascends, Powder Mage, Ruin Of Kings, Mage’s Blood, Emperor’s Blades. 

And even the series that do feature a lot of travel, like Bone Ships, First Law, and Draconis Memoria, don’t have the ‘spirit of adventure’ that I’d like, with a measured pace, evocative descriptions, and detours. 

When I started reading epic fantasy in the 90s, many my favourite series were centred around, at least at first, lengthy quests or travels. Books like Wheel of Time, Belgariad, Dragonlance, Memory Sorrow &amp; Thorn, Books 2 &amp; 3 of Riftwar. I loved how these stories took the characters all around the land and into different environments. Of course, Lord Of The Rings is the original of this.

I especially love quests that start small - like Silverthorn and The Diamond Throne both start with the quest for a cure to poison - and then the scope of the plot gets gradually larger and larger as the wider mystery is revealed. I also really like when the main character is underpowered and inexperienced, so we get to experience the world through their eyes. 

So are there any recent fantasy series that have this vibe to them?",fantasy
I need psychotic FMCs ,"Give me the innocent little princesses turn into the beast (glances at arcane). Give me the crazy princess turn into a crazier Queen (looks at the young elites). Give me the female rage, give me the wrong, give me the corruption arc that have no turning point!

Even better if it has romance as a subplot but only if it doesnt have spice. It'll be fine if it is a trilogy or series and has one spice scene or something but the cleaner the better! Especially books where she is the grumpy crazy one and he is the sunshine calm one.

I can only think of arcane that fits flawlessly into what I am looking for—it's a show but hell if it isn't perfect. I loved everything about it, the characters, the pace, the world. The young elites was good though I wish we had a different ending. Heartless was fine but it had her sweet and innocent the entire time, wish there had been a sequel. The ninth house isn't exactly a corruption arc but I loved Alex's personality. Erida from the realm breaker—she was the only good thing about those books. Jude from the cruel prince. Ruinin from the poppy war. I liked red queen's Mare's character development, and the silver hair girl too (can't remember her name) though I had a few issues with the books.

Edit: Can you also mention if it has romance in it or not.

Edit 2: Thanks for the recs guys!!!",fantasy
Tier List of my read books,"I did a tier list out of boredom really. Started reading late in life so list is small enough to do so. I find it interesting that I often have different opinions than the mainstream it seems. In full disclosure, I am only a bit more than half way through two books on the list, Ruin of Kings and Rhythm of War, but enough already that I feel 95% confident in the rating. I can already say Ruin of Kings is Top 5 book I have ever read and I am putting it at third best Fantasy right behind Brandon Sanderson. Another note is that over time I have actually bumped up a few heavy hitters that at first I just didn't get the hype. However, as time goes on and I read other books and also let them simmer in my memory, they are growing on me and rising up the list. Notably those include Malice, Children of Time, Eye of the World, Sword of Kaigen, and The Dragonbone Chair. So while many will hate how low they are, understand that they used to be lower. LOL    S - Must Read, A - Top Class, B - Really Enjoyed, C - Entertaining , D - Just not my thing / Boring / Overbearing Preachy Agenda, F - Bad / Like Pulling Teeth to Finish.   Memoirs Found in A Bathtub is the 2nd worst book I have ever read IMOP, beat out only by The Red Badge of Courage.  Also, most of these are pretty well known, but special mention to some sleepers in there.  Taylor Anderson's Destroyermen Series which is a lost in an alternate universe sci-fi / fantasy and Steven Paul Leiva's Traveling in Space which is a first contact sci-fi with a unique twist of being told from the alien point of view.

"Quiet, Slightly Dark Fantasy Shows?","Hi! I’m looking for recommendations for a certain style of TV show, though honestly I’m not quite sure if I know how to describe it. The commonalities seem to be: a kind of quiet but serious treatment of the fantasy elements; a grounding in the real world; and some equally real-world themes explored in a subtle and often slightly dark way. They have a tendency to get canceled after a season or two, unfortunately. 

Shows like this I’ve loved: In the Flesh, Wolf Like Me, Lockwood &amp; Co., some of Being Human UK.

Shows that aren’t it: Shadowhunters, Winx Saga, Merlin, Discovery of Witches, Good Omens, Buffy.

Would love any recommendations if people have them!",fantasy
What's some cultural differences that you've noticed about fantasy books written by people from another culture? ,"For example, the ideas of individualism are prevalent in Western fantasy stories, so much so that the characters feel distant with each other to me. I've never really noticed it before until I read fantasy books written by native Chinese writers. I noticed that the characters tend to be more enmeshed with each other, which tend to create these complicated relationships and bonds that makes the stories interesting and emotionally charged.",fantasy

"
Books where the main character goes through a temporary regression phase","Sorry if the title is unclear. I'm having trouble describing exactly what I'm looking for but there's a certain trope I see in media sometimes that I enjoy. I like seeing a point in the story where the main character goes through a phase where they regress, struggle with their powers, or even go to the dark side of their story, and the people around them have to deal with it.  Any situation where the villain brainwashes the MC for a little while or they're going through some mental turmoil due to their powers. Something like that. I've also seen a mixture of both situations, where the MC starts using powers that the villains usually use. I've primarily enjoyed seeing these tropes in children's fantasy/horror.

I'll take any suggestions due to my unclear descriptions but I prefer male mcs and no romance. I don't mind if this trope happens later in a book series, I actually kind of prefer it as these tropes are usually more enjoyable after you've spent some time with the characters. 

Also, super heavy books/bad endings are a dealbreaker right now. Thanks.",fantasy
Need recs for a new fantasy book series to get into ,"I just finished the Shades of Magic series and need help finding a series to follow it up.

I'm looking for something in a similar vein but with slightly more romance than shades of magic had. Not like smut every other chapter but more than just interrupted kissing and some ""fade to black"" scenes. A happy medium would be nice.

I prefer the main character to be a female who's not a teenager. Or for there to be multiple perspectives told with at least one of them being female. I've loved my fair share of YA books (especially the shadowhunter chronicles) that are like this but I just can't relate to teenagers anymore.

I like most types of fantasy just nothing too political based and definitely no omegaverse. I prefer more character based plots rather than some high fantasy that's all about the crown and the realm and all that. I'm more in the mood for an urban fantasy or some low fantasy with pirates or thieves. More like Lila's plot line in the shades of magic. 

Also, I'm good with serious or heavier themes, but I need some humor and sarcasm thrown in there too.

Anything with at least 3 books to the series is a huge plus.

Please and thank you to all recommendations.",fantasy
What are some of the best Pre-1990 Fantasy books/series? (Other than Tolkien),"So I know modern fantasy is the vast majority of book recs here, but I've always been really into the classic stuff too, I love going back and finding those hidden gem books that were great but are barely discussed anymore (except in their own communities). I know The Wheel of Time and A Song of Ice and Fire got their starts in the 1990s so I want to go to just before that as my cut-off (so anything up to 1990). It's fine if the series continued to be published *after* 1990, as long as the series began before then.

So far the fantasy books I've read that pre-date that are:

* The Riftwar Saga - Raymond E. Feist (Loved them!)
* The Sword of Shannara - Terry Brooks (felt very derivative)
* The Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkien (obviously great)
* Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold! - Terry Brooks (Fun concept, main character wasn't for me)

Here are a few I've not yet read but plan to:

* The Last Unicorn - Peter S. Beagle
* The Neverending Story - Michael Ende
* Conan books - Robert E. Howard
* Barsoom Stories - Edgar Rice Burroughs

Eager to hear what other suggestions are out there?",fantasy

Why did Libba Bray change the cover of The Diviners three times?,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this. I was thinking of posting this on r/books, but I thought it was too broad a sub to reach anyone who might be familiar with the topic.

I know that book cover changes is a perennial issue in the reading community, but to me, this must be one of the most egregious cover change ever. The [first iteration](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NatPT3osL._SL1360_.jpg), to me, was just perfect. It was unique and matches the mood the book was going for. Then they changed it with the release of the second book in the series into this, quite frankly, [super generic design](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51y44xSBSoL.jpg). Until they finally settled for this [final version](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rwVU61AcL._SL1500_.jpg) for the third and fourth series installment. The last one might be better than the first revision, but I still mourn the loss of the first version of the book cover, which is why I'm thankful that the [Fairyloot version](https://community.fairyloot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/09/the-diviners-set-final.jpg?w=1024) existed and was thankful that I got to snag a copy before it phased out.",fantasy

Any Rain Wild Chronicles stans?,"I discovered Robin Hobb this year and tore through the first 3 trilogies. Fell in love with the characters in Farseer but didn't love the ending. Liveship started slow for me but pretty soon I was hooked. Tawny Man was a ride I loved from start to finish, I couldn't get enough of it. 

Now though, I'm 40% of the way through Dragon Keeper and I'm just not as invested as I thought I'd be. I fear I may be prejudiced by the negative things I've heard about it. The thought of going through 4 books of this sounds like a bit of a drag. I've been picking the book up less and less but my stubbornness won't allow me to skip ahead to Fitz and the Fool.

Book Review: The Pale City (Rites of Resurrection #1) by Marshall J. Moore,"**TL;DR Review:** Lightning-fast plot, richly colorful world, and heart-pounding action. Roman/Greek Republic colored with African-inspired culture and magic.

# Full Review:

The living dead are everywhere—and I do mean that literally!

In the city of Albastine, corpses magically turned into “Attendants” do everything from cooking to cleaning, sweeping streets to scrubbing toilets, and, of course, fighting in the city’s wars.

Our main character, Gaius Cassius Calvus, has dedicated his life to controlling these Attendants and marching them into battle against Albastine’s enemies. That service has cost him his best friend, his relationships, and the use of his left arm.

In the beginning, we see Calvus trying in vain to regain control of his magical control over the Attendants, but between the guilt and the pain of his injuries, even the smallest exertion of his will is a struggle. But he has known nothing but service and is driven by a deep desire to make the Republic a better place. So when he gets asked by an old friend, and current Magistrate, to help him investigate a murder, he agrees.

Little does he know, he’s going to get swept up into one hell of a conspiracy!

*The Pale City* begins with a slow, steady pace, taking its time to introduce you to the characters, the magic of the world, and the history of both the Extorani (in my mind, Roman/Greek-flavored) and the Ayu’li (African-inspired) peoples who merged their cultures to found the Republic.

Bit by bit, we’re lured into the mystery behind who assassinated a Senator, but once all the pieces are in place, the story rockets off to a crazy fast pace with all the action I could ask for (and a whole lot more). Never once is character development left by the wayside, though; every time Calvus is faced with a choice, he shows us who he is, digs deeper into his convictions and resolve to stand firm in the face of impossible odds.

The characters around Calvus are equally colorful and complex. His dead best friend’s sister who drags him into the mystery. The Ayu’li High Priestess with whom he shares a complicated past. The Triarchs who head up the republic and the Senators who help them steer. The Imperator who is determined to prove that *Calvus* is behind the assassination. The cruel former teacher who made young Calvus’ life miserable during his years of training.

Every single one of them gets a chance to shine, and they bring so much depth and humanity to every page.

By the end, we’ve seen the specter of danger looming on the Republic’s horizon, but through everything he’s weathered, we have hope Calvus will be the right one to face it. A spectacular and surprisingly upbeat ending to a story that’s not afraid to go dark at times.

*The Pale City* surprised me in so many ways, and impressed me with its lightning-fast plot, richly colorful world, and heart-pounding action. I’ve already dived into the next *Rites of Resurrection* book because I have to find out what lies ahead!",fantasy

[Review] Circle of Stars by Craig Montgomery (SPFBO10),"**I read this for SPFBO. My review only. More about the contest and links at the bottom.**

I was very excited for **Circle of Stars** because I love sci-fi mixed in with my fantasy and to be very shallow here, the cover is beautiful.

\*

Casper, newly kicked out of his home after being outed, finds himself on the other side of the solar system with some pretty cool magic that makes him a very special person to the people of his new world.

Casper is a Telos and he is capable of using all the magic abilities of this world (which is astrology-based) something that is a rare occurrence within the inhabitants living on Novilem; a moon that orbits the planet of Ouranos on the outskirts of our galaxy. He is told that everyone else is limited to the abilities of their star signs- so for instance, Leo are the warriors, they’re strong and agile. Pisces are emotion-based and can influence… etc and you get the picture.

\*  
 

**Circle of Stars** has a lot of neat and fun ideas that I loved: like the craziness of the planet’s surface with its giant mushroom trees and poisonous sacks that burst into flames - to the air being full of stardust matter which contains aether that allows them to use magic. And I’m barely scratching the surface of what all this story offers when it comes to neat and creative things in this world.

 But maybe it had too many cool ideas? Because it did take me a while to settle in to this story, despite its quick intro to Casper, his situation, and even quicker to being someone special.

It’s just a very complicated and full world all around. Between the politics, drug running, alien environment, and magic based off astrology- the signs each having unique attributes that are influenced by their houses (and I’m not even pretending to understand how that all works) that in itself is a lot to take in.  
Then we are also falling in love/building a relationship, while also trying to healthily move on from a messy past (which I approve of the care that’s spent on this btw don’t get me wrong) but the complicated dynamics of everything and everyone involved in such a chock-full story meant that we spent less time getting familiar with each element.

 

So, I did struggle a little with things like when some characters have history together that puts them at odds with one another, and we don’t see it/their interactions etc., until just before we need a little backstory to explain the issue. I do get it and I know I’d be here complaining about length if we had to delve into every character association there was.

I did enjoy the characters of Casper and Helix. Helix, maybe just a bit more, just because he was a little more mature feeling than Casper. I liked the time spent letting them get to know each other and I am definitely an experience-it type of reader- especially for things that involve emotions. I did get some romantasy vibes from their relationship- which you all know I’m a romance fan so I really liked that aspect of this story.

All and all, I thought **Circle of Stars** was a promising start to the series (or duology? I believe I read somewhere) and definitely has some of the cooler ideas I’ve come across lately making for a fun read.

Recommendations: Fantasy Series with Romance,"I've noticed that many popular books these days focus on romance with fantasy elements. I've tried giving them a go, but most of the ones I'm aware of tend to focus on physical attraction over emotional connection. They focus more on lust than love.

"Stories featuring an MC in a committed, long-term relationship that lasts throughout the entire narrative?","This was inspired by a recent thread about ""what kind of male character do you wish to see represented more in fantasy"". Well, this is my answer.

I'm not talking about romantasy or narratives that specifically centre on the relationship. I'd like to read a novel where the relationship is just part of who the characters are, but the story is about something else.

It's always either the cliché of the MC getting with their love interest at the very end, or a happy relationship getting destroyed by the plot relatively early on for cheap drama or character motivation. Boring.

Instead, I would like to see a couple that's more of a team, an ""us against the world"" kind of vibe.

A lot of the weird tattoos, scarifications, and other body modification I like to put in get lost in the armor. The fact my setting is mostly tribal/nomadic with limited armor helps to a degree but this is a handicap I'd like to deal with sooner rather than later. I've taken great inspiration from Michael Kirkbride's Elder Scrolls art but I I'd like to see more as to not feel I'm basically ripping him off.

Three Hearts and Three Lions (1961) Introduced Some of Fantasy's Best Ideas [Light Spoilers],"I'm on the classic journey of the *Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons* [Appendix N reading list](http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm) to help shore up my retro fantasy chops. I had to make a stop after finishing Poul Anderson's ***Three Hearts and Three Lions***, as I'm surprised it doesn't get brought up much in discussion of the classics of the genre.

I'm not going to claim that the book is exceptional; I think the **first half** drags quite a bit especially in light of the modern saturation of tropes such as ""transported to another world."" (Even in Anderson's time it was well-know - the book itself references *A Kid in King Arthur's Court* by name!) But the **back half** is one of the better adventure romps I've read in a while and I really enjoy how Anderson made the self-contained quest feel like it was part of a huge world, subsequently having an **immense influence** on fantasy in the coming decades.

**Law &amp; Chaos**

&gt;Holger got the idea that a perpetual struggle went on between primeval forces of Law and Chaos. No, not forces exactly. Modes of existence? A terrestrial reflection of the spiritual conflict between heaven and hell? In any case, humans were the chief agents on earth of Law, though most of them were so only unconsciously and some, witches and warlocks and evildoers, had sold out to Chaos.

Anderson seems to enjoy putting things in a mythological ""mode"" as he did with *The Broken Sword* - which I read before this (can be read in any order, you'll get different things out of it depending on the order). In *Three Hearts and Three Lions*, he introduces the cosmic concept of **Law** and **Chaos**. He separates this concept from a pure sense of good and evil - developing Chaos throughout the book into a force which opposes humanity but is not necessarily destruction incarnate - again something explored in *The Broken Sword*.

This framing of the idea was incredibly important for the formation of the world of **Elric of Melnibone**, which tells a story almost entirely from the side of an agent of Chaos. *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* picked up the concept and gamified it, creating distinct characteristics and abilities only accessible to people on one side or the other. Subsequent debates around the nature of **Alignment** can all be traced to this book.

**Holy Power**

Christianity and ""holy"" faith is used as a **power** in this world of living pagan deities. It crops up several times, and becomes a major point of the main character's arc to reconcile. *The Broken Sword* delves into this concept to an even more interesting degree, treating the Christian faith as a slowly consuming force that will irrevocably **end** the Age of Legends.

Even with many positive associations, I'm not entirely sure that Anderson is claiming Christianity as a universal good. He seems to poke holes in the way that Christianity's diametric viewpoint is inadequate to solve the **deep problems** of humanity. It's never explicitly stated that Christianity only opposes Chaos, and is in fact perhaps less effective than simply carrying iron. The way that faith is used has far more depth than most avowedly Christian novels - though it always keeps us rooted in the fact that this is a story with ties to the **real world** rather than pure ""high"" fantasy.

**A Champion Reborn**

&gt;""The parts of the pattern are gathered. But do not be sure that the Weaver will complete it.""

Was that a passage from *The Wheel of Time*? No! But it immediately made me think Jordan was a fan.

The entire concept of Moorcock's **Eternal Champion** comes from this book. A character who is many people, manifesting into one which must inevitably do the duty of a hero - even if often tragic. There are a lot of other similarities but I don't want to get too far into Elric spoilers. It's a relatively small part of *Three Hearts and Three Lions* and doesn't factor all that much into the real thrust of the story - though it has many implications.

Coupled with the elements of destiny and detachment Holger wrestles in the book, I feel this is far more similar to the concept of **The Dragon Reborn** than Elric is. Anderson subverts a number of typical ""call to action"" tropes and makes the journey itself seem truly perilous rather than purely exciting. There's not a lot on the general concept beyond being a famous hero in **other times**, but that turned out to be a great template for the grand discovery of multiverses in fantasy fiction.

It's clear that the concept of alternate realities came out of Anderson's scientific interests (he was more prolifically a sci-fi author). He discussed Einstein **multi-universe theories** in the opening Note section. This is part of the interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy through this time period, where the line wasn't **clearly delineated**. There's a lot of ""justification"" for things in the book which aren't strictly needed, yet do give the adventure some flavor and reinforce the idea of the Champion through the novel.

**Fun Adventure Stuff**

As I said, the last portion of this book - after Holger's escape from temptation - really picks up in terms of interesting moments. Holger gets to really develop as a character and become involved in some really cool **quests**. A werewolf mystery, a clever use of a ""magic"" item, and the best riddle scene not written by Tolkien (the conclusion of which had me laugh out loud). Though he is a bit of a **modernist**, wise-cracking main character with an adherence to insufferable logic, the pace of the novel (and remembering when it was written) really helps smooth over that which is overly familiar.

We shouldn't mistake the **troll scene** either, which is one of the best menacing humanoid monsters ever created. You can see why *D&amp;D* stole it wholesale and should be a bigger inspiration to authors writing about ""monsters"" in the traditional sense. A fitting climax against a few frankly forgettable scenes which really feel like tabletop cannon fodder.

--------------

I think this book should definitely be talked about more as a concise, spirited, and influential work in the early conception of modern fantasy. It's got a fair share of rather routine bits, the Scottish Brogue is admittedly hard to read, and it's not Tolkien levels of evocative. It sits in a place which is perhaps seen as superficial, though it is far from **Pulp**. It has something to say and that something resonated with Fantasy storytellers. It should be given the chance to do the same with you!

Cheers.",fantasy
Gets my blood flowing every time I read this: LOTR Aragorn reveals himself to the Rohirrim.,"""..I am not weaponless.""

Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of Andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. ‘Elendil!’ he cried. ‘I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dúnedan, the heir of Isildur Elendil’s son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!’

Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown. Éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes.",fantasy
Dark Story Recommendations,"I’m looking for a fantasy book or book series that is very dark or dipping heavily into horror as well. I want to actually be afraid for some of the main characters.

I really enjoy good world building and don’t really care either way if there’s a romance involved or not. Bonus points if there’s supernatural elements. I just enjoy a good tragic story but it’s just annoying when they’re brought back to life by the next book or chapter.

Charlotte Reads: God Stalk by PC Hodgell,"This has been on my TBR ever since someone recommended it as a Planescape: Torment read-alike, and I decided to bump it up on my list when someone also suggested it for my trauma reading project. While I am not entirely sure about why it was recommended for the trauma reading project yet (I think I need to know more about the protagonist Jame’s backstory), it 100% delivered on the Planescape: Torment front. The city where the book takes place, Tai-tastigon, is truly reminiscent of Sigil from PT, although this book was written before the Planescape setting was created! It is a labyrinthine city full of violence, chaos, bizarre, dark secrets and oddities aplenty. In fact, while I was reading this, I was fantasizing about how it could be adapted into a PT-esque isometric game: exploring the different parts of the city and its strange residents, navigating different factions, completing quests for the Thieves’ Guild, using Jame’s different abilities…well, I can dream, can’t I?  
  
Besides the magnificence of the city and its vibes, I have to say that I was a bit mixed about some other aspects of the book. For one thing, the world-building is quite complex, unique and interesting, which I love!!!!! Throughout, you piece together the story of what happened to the Kencryath thousands of years ago, what has happened to them since coming to this world, Jame’s missing memories, the politics of the Thieves Guild, and how that intersects with the overall politics of Tai-tastigon. However, all of this is conveyed in a somewhat confusing way with things happening/being mentioned offhand before being fully explained/contextualized later. I can’t help but wonder how the world-building could have been conveyed with more clarity while avoiding infodumping. Towards the end of the book the reader has a LOT to keep track of, and while I generally kept up, I similarly feel that it could have been slightly less convoluted in how it unraveled. The guide in the front proved very helpful, and there is mercifully a “Story So Far” segment at the start of the next book, which I know will prove invaluable when I continue on.  
  
Finally, characters and character relationships proved to be generally endearing but fairly one-note. I realized this when several people died without much emotional impact on me at all. There are a LOT of instances of people getting grievously wounded and recovering quickly, as well. It is somewhat extraordinary how much of the book Jame spends running back and forth all over the city, which means that she must be ridiculously fit in addition to being a master thief after only a few months of training and the Only One Who Knows How to Do an Amazing Magical Seduction Dance. It’s all a bit silly, but I think the book knows this and takes it in stride.  
  
  
Do read if you love a weird city and complex, unique lore that gets unraveled bit by bit.  
Don’t read if you need a book to be focused on deep characterization and relationships as opposed to setting/plot.",fantasy

Stone of Farewell ,"I posted just a few days ago about finishing the Dragonbone chair and going straight into stone of farewell. I've heard from a bunch of people that this is the weakest of the trilogy. All I can say to that is well in that case I cant believe how good The third book is because I thought this matched the Dragonbone chair and in fact was a better read because I was already invested. I loved pretty much every subplot and I really liked the character development. What I liked most was that it was pretty much the best middle book of a trilogy I've read. It built the lore in an effective way , made me even more immersed in the world and had a simple structure in that everyone was trying to get to a certain point all from different sides and perspectives but all coming to that point.
I love this authors prose it's really pretty.

Why is Fantasy Committed to Monarchism?,"There seems to be a deep commitment in fantasy to monarchism. And I don't mean just that the story is set within a monarchy; I mean that in many fantasy works a big part of the plot is restoring the ""rightful"" monarch to the throne, or uncovering that the plucky orphan is actually the ""true"" King, or fighting against some usurper who is evil primarily because they sneakily took the throne. So it's not just that there's a political system that may or may not be a good one, it's that the story itself seems to agree that the world will be a better place if the male-line descendant of a previous King sits the throne.

But in real life, almost all of us live in societies that have agreed on some level that monarchy is not a good way of governing, that people should have a voice in their government, and that giving some people political power because of who their ancestors were is inherently unjust. So why do we love seeing this in fantasy?

And to ask a follow-up question: are their works of fantasy that subvert this? Ones where the monarchy presented is not assumed to be the best outcome, or where we're rooting for the usurper, or where our heroes are working to bring down the system?

Fantasy recommendations with likable characters ,"Hello! I am looking for good fantasy recommendations for books/series with interesting worlds and stories that have characters I can actually root for. I'd prefer a series that is finished or at least close to done or is consistently getting new books (I'm looking at you Patrick Rothfuss and GRRM...)

Liked:
I loved the wheel of time series as well as basically everything Brandon Sanderson has written. I also liked the Riyia Revelations (only read the first three when I was a teen), Lord of the Rings, and the Belgariad. I am currently reading the second Farseer book and I'm loving the series so far. Fitz is an excellent main character and I can't wait to watch him continue to grow.

Currently listening to (and have mixed feelings about):
I am two thirds of the way through Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie and considering dropping it (or just pushing through the last 10 hours if the rest of the series gets better). None of the characters have any redeeming values (the only one actively trying to change and be better was just most likely killed &gt;!Cosca!&lt; ). I liked most of the first law trilogy, the storytelling was great and quite a few of the characters I disliked at the beginning became likable by the end as they went through their arcs (and Logan was great the whole time). I didn't like how little the character arcs paid off at the end as Abercrombie slaps you with his pessimistic message that humans never change. I don't know if the rest of the books will be worth reading at this point (unless of course Bayaz gets what's coming to him in a satisfying way that is...)

Not so much (even though they have fine characters):
I read the first two Earthsea books and they just weren't my thing. The plots just weren't that interesting and although the storytelling was pretty, it was also rather boring (I did listen to them while driving, so that may have contributed). 
The Harry Potter books. I started reading them  a while ago when I was 12 and really enjoyed them then, but as an adult the writing is not great and the story was poorly thought out at best. There are some fun characters and moments, but it just gets worse after book 4 and the ending is not done well.

What is a minor detail from a book that's left a lasting impact on you?,"Really great books stick with us for a long time after we finish reading it.

One for me is in The Wheel of Time. I'm fascinated with how information/memories travel over time and space in these books. I often think about how Rand will show up in a town, hear a song, and think, ""Hey! I know that song, but I always knew it as \_\_\_\_.""

Stories where character's feelings and conclusions are wrong?,"It's something of a staple in fiction that a character's thoughts and feelings tend to be correct--hunches, reasoning, ""I have a bad feeling about,"" whenever they find information they always put it together correctly or make a leap of logic that's correct. Occasionally it gets flipped around, usually to teach a lesson about not jumping to conclusions about other people but that's a rather specific trope.

I think it's mostly a function of conservation of detail.

I'm curious if anyone has recommendations for stories where characters have a habit of finding out that they're wrong in their feelings and thoughts and need to try to adjust around that. Bonus points if they still make mistakes after that realization--because just knowing that doesn't mean it can always be corrected--and if multiple characters are doing it.

Not so much looking for stories where a character is ALWAYS wrong. More of a case of characters whose conclusions made at least some degree of sense from their point of view. But they are still wrong.",fantasy

# What is the HEA Book Club?

A book club focusing on the subgenre of fantasy romance, romantic fantasy, and romantasy. These are books that combine elements and tropes of both the Fantasy and Romance genres. Some books may lean slightly more one direction than the other, but the important thing is that a blending of the genres is present in the work. For a book to be classified a Romance, it must have a happy ending for the romantic relationship (HEA - Happily Ever After or HFN - Happy For Now), hence the name!

We will be alternating every month with the [Beyond Binaries Book Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/13bndqh/introducing_bb_bookclub_june_nominations_thread/). Nomination threads will be posted 6-8 weeks before a scheduled month. The month’s host will select a theme, solicit nominations and then conduct a vote on the month’s read. During our reading month we will host midway and final discussion threads, in the 2nd and 4th weeks of the month, respectively.

"What started the trend for fantasy protagonists being  assassins, thieves or spies?","It’s something I’ve noticed for quite some time reading more and more fantasy books. 

When it comes to books from the 80s and earlier decades, the protagonist usually is a warrior/knight or on a way to become one, sometimes they are a mage/sorcerer instead. 
But when I look at books released since the 90s I feel like every second or third book I pick up features a protagonist who’s an assassin, a thief or a spy (most often someone training to become one in case of book series) 

Was there some book or book series which popularised this kind of protagonist? Or did I simply miss older books like that? ",fantasy

Regardless if there are rules to practice it or entities that control its use, I want those that you get to exclaim: ""Hooooly sh*t""

**When two spiritist swindlers accidentally summon something horrific from beyond the stars, they must thwart a sinister time-spanning plot, in this first Victorian-era gaslight fantasy set in the world of Chaosium’s** ***Call of Cthulhu*****.**  
  
*London, 1891.* Elizabeth Whittle and William Grant enjoy scalping London’s bourgeoisie, taking on the personas of grand spiritist Cerulia Trent and her agent to connect the living and the dead. When a detective arrives, sniffing out fraud with a scientifically minded spiritualist society, the duo decides to take one last job before escaping to the continent. However, their final séance ends horrifically… and soon Lizzie isn’t Lizzie anymore. William, desperate to banish whatever monster they summoned, is soon embroiled in an electrifying eldritch mystery where he makes a deal with the devil to save his friend and stop an even greater evil from transforming the known world.

 

**Review:**

I have been mesmerized, traumatized, and left speechless ever since I dived into the works of H.P. Lovecraft for the very first time during the last year. Since then, not only has my perspective of reading changed significantly (and I’m not only talking about the horror/supernatural genre), but I’m constantly looking for more such media which delve deep into the Lovecraftian world/lore, be it movies, TV shows, and/or books. And one fine day, while just casually browsing through NetGalley for some interesting reads, I sighted *The Shadow on the Glass* by Jonathan L. Howard, to be published by Aconyte Books, and pitched as follows:

*When two spiritist swindlers accidentally summon something horrific from beyond the stars, they must thwart a sinister time-spanning plot, in this first Victorian-era gaslight fantasy based and set in the vast Call of Cthulhu roleplaying world from Chaosium. Step into a realm of mystery and cosmic horror with Call of Cthulhu, where everyday people become investigators of the unknown.*

Yeah… the request button hasn’t been clicked any faster and harder if I’m being totally honest. I would sincerely like to thank the author and the publishers, Aconyte Books, for providing me with a digital ARC, and for giving me the opportunity to review this cosmic horror adventure.

 

**What’s it about?**

Here’s how the book sets the tone right from the get-go:

***There are realities other than the mundane one we perceive. Its places, people and occurrences are inexplicable to rational scientific thinking and antithetical to our existence. Ancient lore, monsters, forbidden tomes, and diabolical cults are just the forerunners of the unimaginable entities who dwell in the cosmic void. They are coming for us: our world and our very minds. Exposure to such horrors can lead to madness, but some bold souls must make a stand against these seemingly insurmountable odds. Defeating them will save the world as we know it; failure will usher in the end times. Can you hear the Call of Cthulhu?***

If that doesn’t get your blood pumping and your heart racing (while also giving you chills and goosebumps at the same time!), then I don’t quite know what will to be very honest!

Welcome to London, 1891… the good ‘ol Victorian-era with gas lamps, cobbled streets, and chimney smoke among other things. What’s there not to like about it, eh?

Miss Elizabeth “Lizzie” Whittle from the East End and Mr. William “Bill” Grant, a Mancunian born and bred, make a living straight off the pockets of London’s elite. How so, you ask? By performing a well-researched séance and putting up a grand show of making a connection between the living and dead. Or as they like to call it – an “experiment in spiritualism”. With Lizzie donning the persona of spiritist (not to be called as a “medium”, mind you) Cerulia Trent, and Bill (the “fairest of criminals”) acting as the spiritist’s agent/manager, things are going pretty smooth for the duo…

*And so this was the nature of the business of Miss Cerulia Trent and Mr William Grant: immoral, certainly; lucrative, definitely; criminal… well, perhaps not. For they never asked for money, trusting to the strictures of social nicety to bind their clients as tightly as a leather stock.*

… up until a nosy policeman decides to show up and ruin their future plans - Detective Sergeant Norman Bradley of the New Scotland Yard. The detective is certain that the duo is nothing but imposters pretending to fool the public by performing cheap tricks. With the fear of their gimmick getting exposed, Bill and Lizzie decide to take one big swoop before getting off the mainland. Fortune favors the brave, after all, and the perfect opportunity has arrived in the form of a wealthy and powerful governor, Sir Donovan Clay.

One final show. And they are home free, quite literally.

What could possibly go wrong…?

*… something had gone truly terribly wrong.*

*Something different, something greater, something unknowable, something alien to everything Grant had ever experienced or felt or imagined in his life was present in that room.*

Strap your seat belts and buckle up for an adventure quite unlike any other…!

The world as we know it is in great danger, and two “spiritist swindlers” stand in the way of humanity and those that are beyond space and time…

*“I don’t want to die, but if anything in the history of humanity was ever worth fighting for, it’s this.”*

From missing people to dangerous thugs, from secret societies to fanatic cults, and from ancient alien races to cosmic horrors of the unknown…

***Can you hear the Call of Cthulhu?***

 

**The good:**

●       First off, the writing was really, really good!

●       The plot was just SUPERB in every possible way.

●       The characters were nicely written, and a few turned out to be quite memorable as well.

●       The third person perspective with multiple POVs was very well executed.

●       I am a sucker for a well-portrayed Victorian-era setting, and the author more than managed to do just that.

●       The Lovecraftian theme was excellently integrated, and I really enjoyed the lore present.

●       Lastly, there were so many well-timed LOL moments (mainly thanks to the language/accent), and I had a total blast with it!

 

**The “not so” good:**

●       There was just one small “complaint” for me to point out – the writing, as good as it was, wasn’t quite easygoing or simple on a few occasions, but rather “posh” throughout, so as to speak. The vocabulary/phrases, along with quite a lot of English/British slang, did get a tad bit difficult to read and understand initially. Having said that, once I did get used to it eventually, it was smooth sailing.

 

**Standout dialogues/phrases/quotes/text:**

●       “My point being that we’re only recently starting to grasp what a curious box of tricks the human mind is. The received wisdom is that madness is a sign of moral degradation or of intrinsic structural faults in the brain. But consider, what if we are all a great deal more fragile between the ears than we might like to believe? The twentieth century shall be the century of the alienist, I feel sure…”

●       “… Not one of us on God’s Earth knows everything and we should be very grateful for that, because some knowledge is too dreadful for the mind and conscience of mortal man to bear.”

●       The irrational, he reminded himself, can take a grip of anyone. History is not short of examples, after all.

●       People see a thing they don’t understand, it’s like a poison in the mind.

 

**Other info.**

●       There were quite a few awesome references/Easter Eggs present, the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper (and given the timeline, not surprising whatsoever!), along with that of Edgar Allan Poe! The nerd in me liked all of those for sure.

 

**Final thoughts:**

I honestly don’t know what to say other than – SHEESH! That was an adventure and a half! “A Cthulhu by gaslight novel set in the Victorian-era” was a no-brainer pick for me personally, and it absolutely lived up to and surpassed all the expectations in every possible way! Boasting an excellent prose, a superb plot, well-written and memorable characters, well-executed setting alongside the Lovecraftian lore, and a bag of LOL moments, *The Shadow on the Glass* by Jonathan L. Howard is just the perfect start imaginable to the first Victorian-era gaslight fantasy set in the world of Chaosium’s *Call of Cthulhu*. I’m certainly very much looking forward to the next installments. To put it plainly – I thoroughly enjoyed it, and also HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you don’t miss out!

"[Review] Jam Reads: Gorse, by Sam K. Horton","https://preview.redd.it/erv0fdq44spd1.jpg?width=919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7497c809e8d957b4280189279286f43ab538044a

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/gorse-the-eythin-legacy-1-by-sam-k-horton)

*Gorse* is the first book in the historical dark fantasy series *The Eythin Legacy*, written by Sam K. Horton, and published by Solaris Books. A lyrical and atmospherical story that portrays the conflict between religion and folklore, small town politics and the own fair folk, all to create a highly immersive novel.

Pelagius Hunt, the Keeper, and his foster daughter, Nancy, take care of the moors and the creatures of the Other World while also helping the people from Mirecoombe, a small rural village. However, when a series of deadly murders happen in the moors, most of the villagers, influenced by the Christian priest, Cleaver, agree that the cause is the belief of many people in the Other People; spoiled by Cleaver, they decide to prove their Christianity by purifying the moor with fire.  
This action not only affects the Other People, but also puts the delicate equilibrium maintained by the Keeper in doubt, threatening the own survival of Morecoombe. Our two characters will have to find the truth behind the murders and restore the deal with the creatures of the moor, even traveling to the Other World for it.

A novel that draws into the mentor-student relationship between Pelagius and Nancy: the old and grumpy Keeper and the young and powerful Nancy; Pelagius took some decisions in the past that are coming back to bite his hand. However, when the danger arises for the moor, we will see a Pelagius that will risk himself to restore the difficult peace of the place, even if the village is now rejecting him. In comparison, Nancy's arc is one more centered about self-discovery and trust, about getting the hang of her power and finally become part of the village as an outside.  
As the main antagonist, Cleaver is an interesting character. He had a friendship with Pelagius in the past, but after a traumatic event, he became more fanatical, and broke the ties with his friend. You can see there's still a bit of fondness from Pelagius to his old friend; but Cleaver is basically acting as a result of pain and fanaticism, putting the focus on how religion can manipulate you in your lowest moments.

Horton's writing is a bit dense, but it pairs well with this kind of dark and atmospheric story; the historical aspect of the novel is well researched and transmitted through the use of certain terms. While the resolution of the mystery can be a bit predictable, the worldbuilding and the blend of Celtic and Cornish mythology work well, capturing also the sensation of being in a small isolated rural village.

*Gorse* is, by all terms, an excellent dark historical novel, perfect if you are looking for a story that revolves around the conflict between folklore and religion sprinkled with the presence of the Fair Folk. I'm really curious to see how this series will continue, but definitely Sam Horton has picked my interest!",fantasy
Just one more person’s thoughts on Kushiel’s Dart,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, because the way some people talk about it makes it sound as if it's just a bunch of scandalous sex scenes connected by a thin thread of plot. As it turns out, the sex scenes—which, for the record, I don't particularly enjoy, because I am very much not a masochist—are only a small fraction of what the book actually is. Most of them are concentrated in the first third of the book and are described in a way that's more matter of fact than erotic. (I do totally get why the explicit scenes would be a dealbreaker for some people and that's fair, but they are very much not what the book is *about* to me).

I loved a lot of things about this; these are just a few:

-a female main character who is incredibly active and exercises a lot of agency—Phédre has her flaws and her judgment isn't always perfect, but she is not a character who is going to sit by and just let things happen to her, and it makes her really fun to read.

-a vivid world that starts small and gets bigger—the initial setting the Night Court, which makes up a small portion of the city, then expands to include the entire city, then takes us on several journeys (or one long journey, depending on how you spin it) that explore other regions of the world.

-an excellent supporting cast, including a love interest whom I find to be absolutely delightful (&gt;!I am a sucker for a hot priest, for which I blame Fleabag!&lt;)

-a great mix of political intrigue, interpersonal drama, adventure, and war

-beautiful, immersive prose, which some people might (justifiably) find too wordy but I really enjoyed, especially because it matches up so well with who Phédre is as a character and how she would be inclined to describe things

I think this took me about four days to read, which says a lot about how addictive I found it—a book this long would usually take me longer than that. All in all, I'm a big fan and very excited to continue the trilogy.",fantasy
Atmospheric Worlds Recs,"What are some book series that have very atmospheric worlds, this could be fantasy, or sci fantasy, even sci-fi. What I mean by this is worlds that when I just think about the books that the world just invokes a particular feeling that you know is this world, whether it is from prose, characters, descriptions or anything. The biggest three examples of this for me are Lord of the Rings, just the way Tolkien writes you immediately and will always feel the size, depth and most importantly the beauty of this world, you just think about it and you have the feeling of the world of Middle Earth.  The next would be Mistborn, I don't know exactly what Sanderson did to just invoke such a feeling of the world but he did, when I think about it I have such a clear picture and feeling in my head, and I think it's exactly what he wanted. The last would be the Faithful and the Fallen, I dont know if it's just his style or the words he chooses, but from the very start I have felt the sense of grayness and forboding over this world, and every time I think about it that feeling is so clear. I think a couple that start to hit this but aren't quite as strong would be the Will of the Many and Stormlight Archive. I think they both do a good job of having a deep world and setting a good atmosphere but I think the atmosphere is just not quite as strong as these others. Thank you for your Recommendations.

Best Battle Speeches in Fantasy?,"Who has delivered the most moving, motivational speech before a major conflict? ",fantasy
"What is the most emblematic paragraph of the Fantasy Genre? If You had to pick one, which would it be?","Choosing the most emblematic paragraph to represent the entire fantasy genre is a challenge, but some passages perfectly encapsulate its core elements.

This famous quote from The Fellowship of the Ring shows that fantasy is more than just swords and magic — it’s about the human condition, confronting impossible odds, bearing the weight of responsibility, and choosing to rise above fear:

&gt;""‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.

&gt;‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.’""

However, I would love a quote that I could share with someone unfamiliar with the genre, one that highlights both the moral choices and some of the imaginative elements that are often found in fantasy—whether that's magic, personal quests, the blending of the ordinary and extraordinary, or stories that challenge the boundaries of reality.

With that said, if you had to pick just one, which would you choose?",fantasy

# [Walkaway](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40604388-walkaway) by Cory Doctorow

&gt;Hubert Vernon Rudolph Clayton Irving Wilson Alva Anton Jeff Harley Timothy Curtis Cleveland Cecil Ollie Edmund Eli Wiley Marvin Ellis Espinoza―known to his friends as Hubert, Etc―was too old to be at that Communist party.

&gt;But after watching the breakdown of modern society, he really has no where left to be―except amongst the dregs of disaffected youth who party all night and heap scorn on the sheep they see on the morning commute. After falling in with Natalie, an ultra-rich heiress trying to escape the clutches of her repressive father, the two decide to give up fully on formal society―and walk away.

&gt;After all, now that anyone can design and print the basic necessities of life―food, clothing, shelter―from a computer, there seems to be little reason to toil within the system.

&gt;It’s still a dangerous world out there, the empty lands wrecked by climate change, dead cities hollowed out by industrial flight, shadows hiding predators animal and human alike. Still, when the initial pioneer walkaways flourish, more people join them. Then the walkaways discover the one thing the ultra-rich have never been able to buy: how to beat death. Now it’s war – a war that will turn the world upside down.

&gt;Fascinating, moving, and darkly humorous, Walkaway is a multi-generation SF thriller about the wrenching changes of the next hundred years…and the very human people who will live their consequences.

# [Ecotopia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/550165.Ecotopia) by Ernest Callenbach

&gt;A novel both timely and prophetic, Ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia is a hopeful antidote to the environmental concerns of today, set in an ecologically sound future society.

&gt;Ecotopia was founded when northern California, Oregon, and Washington seceded from the Union to create a “stable-state” ecosystem: the perfect balance between human beings and the environment. Now, twenty years later, this isolated, mysterious nation is welcoming its first officially sanctioned American visitor: New York Times-Post reporter Will Weston.

&gt;Skeptical yet curious about this green new world, Weston is determined to report his findings objectively. But from the start, he’s alternately impressed and unsettled by the laws governing Ecotopia’s earth-friendly agenda: energy-efficient “mini-cities” to eliminate urban sprawl, zero-tolerance pollution control, tree worship, ritual war games, and a woman-dominated government that has instituted such peaceful revolutions as the twenty-hour workweek and employee ownership of farms and businesses. His old beliefs challenged, his cynicism replaced by hope, Weston meets a sexually forthright Ecotopian woman and undertakes a relationship whose intensity will lead him to a critical choice between two worlds.

Counts for: First in a series.

Question about Tombs of Atuan,"Has anyone read Earthsea by Ursula Guin? 

I read the first four books and loved them, but my least favourite was the Tombs of Atuan. To me (vague spoilers) 90% of the book was just describing the daily lives on a boring cult, then at the end there's an exposion and a somewhat plot twist.

I was susprised to check reddit's opinions on the books when I was done and see that many users' favourite book is that one. 

Can anyone who genuinely loved that book tell me why they liked it, even from an academic perspective? Because in my subjective perspective the story wasn't good at all.

"Weak Prose, Amazing Story","Does a weak prose from the author take away from what is otherwise a perfect story? I often see people on GoodReads complain of popular books, that they DNF’d it because they couldn’t stand the way the author writes.

Baru Cormorant Series - is it me or is it a bit tedious,"So I read Traitor Baru Cormorant and I didn't quite get the hype. It was still a very good 4/5. A little more speculative fiction than fantasy for my general taste, but a good read with a good and surprising plot and an interesting world.

But jeez book 2 was a slog. The end was good but the first 4/5ths of the book was grindingly slow with characters like Apparitor who seem very different from their book 1 personas.

Book 3 has the same problem IMHO. The Womb in book 2 is not the same character in book 3. I can see some reasoning but I keep feeling like characters have an abrupt change in personality that's not earned.

The plot getting mired in Kypranoke drove me crazy too. The plot armour of a number of antagonists was a bit too convenient or inconvenient as well. And some of the MC's suffering seemed unearned and little misery pornish.

In terms of the overall series I kept reading but the books were very draining. Is this just me? The hype for this series (not just here - I read it on an agent's recommendation TBH) is huge.",fantasy
Looking for recommendations with a Dungeons &amp; Dragons feel to them.,"I grew up playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons and it was my first real introduction into the world of fantasy and it's still my favorite genre to read. I've read a lot of well established fantasy authors and while they're great and I definitely have my favorite authors, they haven't always scratched that specific itch. Lately, I've been reading a lot of self published litRPG on Kindle, and while some of them are actually pretty good (at least the ones that are edited properly), I'm getting a little burned out on them. I think they appealed to me because a lot of them have that D&amp;D campaign vibe that I've been craving, where a character is either dropped somewhere or already exists in that world and has to start from scratch with their mission or whatever their cause is. They start alone and along the way they meet and recruit other characters of all different groups and races to their cause, but in a natural, well thought out way. The main character can possibly be of questionable moral character, but ultimately good, and their true traits come out more and more as the book progresses. Throughout the book, random but interesting side missions might pop up that don't necessarily have anything to do with the ultimate goal but are interesting none the less and add to character development. I'm not opposed to reading more of the litRPG style, because I'm beginning to think it's my only option for what I'm asking, but I'm open to any other recommendations as well. The most important part is that the storyline, dialogue, and characters are well developed and thought out, as this not always the case with some of the books I've found lately. Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this and I'm looking forward to any recommendations you might have!",fantasy
The Chaos Storm Chronicles - free ebook and giveaway!,"Today is the anniversary of publishing my novel, The Chaos Storm Chronicles, and also my birthday; so, in hobbit tradition, I’m giving everyone gifts this year! The ebook edition is free and I’ll be giving away one physical copy to someone in the comments below. See the end of this post for details!

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

Amazon link: https://a.co/d/0wwm6IW

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

When magic-school-dropout Estinance Ratter runs away from home to work as a cartographer at the edges of reality, she quickly realizes that the world may be larger and more dangerous than she’d anticipated. Assigned to a team under the leadership of the hot-headed Decory, will Esti return from her first expedition with maps to sell and fund her dreams, or will the dangers of living on the world’s edge be a stark awakening?

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

Some of my favorite quotes from beta readers and reviews:

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

“I wanted to start off by saying I abandoned my notes around a quarter of the way through because I kind of just got caught up in reading.”

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

“The landscape being kind of a core part of the story itself, it felt like it held its own weight. Like the setting and the landscape was a character itself. “

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

“I love the premise. Characters that have a profession are fairly rare. Narration and descriptions were good. They allowed me to picture the land and what was happening clearly and precisely. It's no poetry, but it doesn't need to be. It reads easy, gets the job done “

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

This book represents an era of my world, with plans to explore different times and places in the future, each as its own standalone book with a growing thread snaking through their backgrounds. This era is made up of four parts, all present in The Chaos Storm Chronicles, but the first part, The Chaos Storm Expedition, was entered into the SPFBO and received these lovely comments:

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

“This world is quite a fascinating one, where Chaos Storms literally create new parts of the world ... it can be very dangerous, which I thought came across really well.” … “This world is fascinating, and I would like to see where the author goes next with it.” https://youtu.be/lAF7qk7IYrQ?si=o4Id5_EAEwTaG1pb&amp;t=104

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

I wrote this book in the early years of being married and becoming a father through many bouts with depression, switching jobs, and losing loved ones. I spent a lot of time studying writing advice, my favorite being from Brandon Sanderson and Jim Butcher, and polished my manuscript with the help of the r/fantasy and r/fantasywriters quarterly call for beta readers, from which some of the above quotes came. It’s been an amazing journey to see my hard work out there in the world, so thank you to everyone who took the time to check it out.

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

Now for the giveaway! Breathtaking vistas are a core part of Esti’s journey and writing those moments where we see a new portion of the world in all its chaotic glory were my favorite bits to write. The most beautiful view I’ve personally seen was Alaskan glaciers, and my dream vacation would be a trip to New Zealand; tell me in the comments what the most beautiful view you’ve ever seen was, or where your dream vacation would be for a chance to win a physical copy of The Chaos Storm Chronicles!

Recommendations for Surrealist Tragedy literature?,"Lately I have been enamored by the music video The Greatest Living Show by Toby Fox &amp; Itoki Hana (Link: https://youtu.be/qFow8LkHtlU?si=KnI0sRve6d2WJMLe )


Not just for the splendidly lush visuals &amp; music, but also its Fairy Tale-like story of whimsical surrealism turned to unnerving tragedy.


It made me want to find actual literature that emulates the similar feeling of Fairy Tale/Fantasy with heavy themes of Surrealism &amp; Tragedy, the only similar thing I’ve found to it is the Classic Anime film Belladonna of Sadness.",fantasy
Sites for fantasy with young adult romances filtered out?,"Anyone know of a site to track new releases or reviews on fantasy books, but with young adult category ones filtered out?

Fantasy books like Made in Abyss/Blame!/Shadow of the Colossus/Outer Wilds/Dragon's Dogma (Everfall or Bitterblack Island) etc.,"And what I mean by that is in relation to the exploration of structures (whether natural or not like in Made in Abyss/Blame!), places or something similar that are gigantic and mysterious, that cause admiration and curiosity. It can even be something crazier like the Eye of the Universe from Outer Wilds. Basically I look for anything that has something unknown, unusual and cryptic for the rules and characters of that world, as if it had a ''divine'' aura.  


It can also be cosmic horror like some works by H.P. Lovecraft (like the underwater domain of Cthulhu, ancient ruins of never-before-discovered civilizations and stuff). Anything really, I just ask that you don't recommend sci-fi unless it's something absolutely incredible.",fantasy
Having trouble keeping track of characters in Taliesin (the Pendragon Cycle),"I started *Taliesin*, the first book of The Pendragon Cycle by Stephen Lawhead, and think the setting is interesting, but I’m having a hard time keeping track of the characters.

I get that there’s Charis in Atlantis and Elphin not in Atlantis (Roman England or something?), but the side characters I’ve kind of lost track of. In particular the royalty, such as Charis’s father who is a king who knows other kings but not Elphin’s father who is also a king. And there’s a queen who can do magic but I lost which king she is married to.

I found a family tree on line, but it seems to have spoilers in it (Charis was married, for instance). Are there any spoiler-free lists (dramatis personae, family trees, etc) that shows how things are at the start of *Taliesin*? I saw one for *A Game of Thrones* that helped immensely (I originally thought Ned and Eddard were different people!).

Or if there isn’t one, would anyone be willing to just list out the characters I need to care about and their relations to Charis and Elphin at the start?",fantasy
"Review: The ""unhewn throne"" trilogy","I recently finished this series - written by Brian Stravely - in audiobook format and thought I'd do a short review. 

The basic backstory of the series is something of a 3-way conflict:
* the emotionless, immortal, and highly intelligent race known as the Csestriim
* The Gods, which essentially each represent an emotion of sorts
* Humans, which are descended from Csestriim but are regarded as an aberration by their forebearers

There are three main characters, each children of the Emperor:
* Kaiden, who trains under an order of monks
* Valyn, who trains under an elite military order that fly on giant birds
* Adare, who is training in state matters


The story alternates between the main characters - who periodically meet or overlap but often work separately - as they deal with plots of the Csestriim, invading foreign nations, and internal strife or politics with the odd Leech (humans with supernatural powers) thrown in the mix.

Overall, the character development is decent though some of it does rely on a bit of exaggerated ignorance. The ending wasn't entirely surprising, but the twists on the way definitely keep things interesting.

The plot is also bloody and fairly violent - think wars mixed with religion and revolution - which may not be for everyone.

Simon Vance's Narration of the audiobook is very good. There are some characters whose vocal representations overlap a bit, but given the number of people throughout the series that's not entirely unexpected, and he had a good range of representation for different characters, genders, and emotions (or lack thereof for the Csestriim).

If you're looking for a good if sometimes brutal fantasy series with diverse characters and decent twists, it's worth grabbing these and having a listen!",fantasy
Anyone Excited For Wolf King On Netflix? Witcher Sirens of the Deep Too?? ,"BECAUSE I AM! i haven't read the books, recently discovered them even before I knew about the upcoming Netflix show, but I'm tempted to start them now... The animation looks great and music sounds immaculate. 

Still can't find a release date (same thing with Witcher Sirens of the Deep in the beginning, now set for next year?!) hopefully it's soon because I want some new fantasy series!! 

I'm also very excited to have an actual release date for the Witcher animated film! It was announced back in what? 2023? And nothing besides the trailer and cast. Sadly we will have to wait till February next year for it to come out :( I remember when the first Witcher animated movie came out on my very first day of University. saw it before I went to school and we have a sequel really happy to see another animated project!!

I just finished Assassin's Apprentice and I feel extremely conflicted (Review),"Assassin's Apprentice, along with the fifteen other books in the Realm Of The Elderlings seem to be one of the most universally beloved books here in this subreddit and the various other fantasy book communities. While it isn't nearly as popular outside the fantasy community compared to other books, it seems to be more beloved by the community than other series like The Wheel Of Time, Malazan, Stormlight etc. because I barely ever hear a bad word about it.

But despite all the praise heaped upon it, I came in with mixed expectations. I have to be honest, the little I knew about the story and the world it is set in did not interest me all that much. Everything from the name of the characters and places, the world it is set in and its magic system didn't seem particularly fun or unique but I just felt like I had to get the damn books because of; 1. I thought the covers looked really nice (I know, sue me), 2. They were pretty cheap on Amazon (I got them all three paperbacks for around seventeen dollars) and 3. Because of how good you guys said it was.

And after finishing Assassin's Apprentice, I still feel conflicted and my feelings are pretty mixed. I guess I'll just list down what I liked about the book and what I didn't like about it.

The pros:

1. I don't think I have read a physical book (there are a few online stories where I felt more connected to the protagonist) where I connected with the protagonist quite as much as I did  than when I read this. I think Fitz is a wonderfully realistic and well written character who feels extremely human and acts his age more than most other characters his age in other works, even though he is said to be more mature.

2. The sincerity and the lack of clever quips and comeback in every other piece of dialogue was quite refreshing. Dialogue feels pretty sparse in this book compared to most others but feels very sincere and meaningful everytime Fitz talks to someone.

3. I feel like all the characters were written quite well and serve their roles perfectly. Even though the story is told from the unreliable perspective of one person who happens to be a child at the time when these events happen, I feel like characters feel more human than in most others.

The cons:

1. One thing that I have always heard people praise when talking about Robin Hobb's works is her prose. I personally have to disagree with it. There weren't many (if any) words I didn't understand with a few idioms and phrases that I had think about for a moment. Yet despite the relatively easy to understand choice of words and phrases, it sometimes feels like a chore to get through. Don't get me wrong, once you get yourself into the right mood and mindset, it can feel incredibly immersive and can really suck you in but it is hard to get into those moods everytime I read and I have had to put the book down many times because of the way she writes.

2. The pacing was one of the biggest weaknesses in the story for me. While many years passed within the book, it still felt incredibly slow most a lot of the time. There wasn't really a cohesive plot for most of the book and it felt like an introduction more than anything. One of the biggest reasons, imo, for the pacing being kinda bad is Fitz's lack of agency. He feels like a plastic bag blowing in whatever directions the people around him plot. I know that this makes sense for his character but still, I felt like it could have been faster paced with Fitz making more decisions without the story truly suffering from it.

3. The worldbuilding didn't really suck me in at all if I had to be honest. I personally rank how good a book's worldbuilding is by how much I think about what life would be like within such a world and just the history behind the world in general which I have to admit, I did not at all for this book. It wasn't particularly bad but it still felt generic and run of the mill, something you would see in your typical isekai anime. But it does get better with the introduction of the Mountain Kingdoms at the end.

And while there were many moments while reading the book where I wanted to just read something else and save it for later, I am glad I got through the damn thing. While I have many problems with it, I am sure that most of them will be addressed after finishing the trilogy. But overall, without having read any of the other books, I give Assassin's Apprentice, a solid 6/10.",fantasy
Is there a word/phrase for when character decisions/actions are just there to further the plot?,"I'm wondering if there is a term you use when reading a book and the decisions or actions a character takes make no logical sense, but purely are there to further the plot.

For example, I remember reading Trudi Caravan's Black Magician series and they have a magical ability  to read someone's mind - but purely to give serve the plot, they decide not to do this during a trial to prove someone's innocence. Instead of clearing up the matter in 5 minutes, it means that character is sent into exile and creates an Act 2 for the book.

Just finished Passenger by Alexandra Bracken (possible spoilers),"I absolutely loved it! Very well written, and I loved how she wrote time travel, putting a more fantasy spin on it then alot of the common sci-fi tropes. You're definitely thrown into the deep end with Etta in the beginning, you know just what she does (which is basically nothing) which gives the reader the same feelings of confusion and trying to figure out what the heck is going on while Etta is also trying to figure out what is going on. I was a little worried that would continue, but we soon got a good explanation of what had happened, but even as we found out more of what was going on, there was still mysteries we didn't know that kept you reading. I sped through the book in just over 2 days, and once I finished I didn't quite know what to do with myself 😂. I've already started the sequel, but just barely.

The Golden Fool,"I cried like a baby.

I’ve read so much about and watched so many videos on the series as a whole. I saw so many people saying how emotional it was and while I agree 100% I’m just not one to cry from media often. I hadn’t during this series up until this point. Holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I’ve loved every second of the 8 books I’ve read so far and Chapter 20: Coterie felt like I was there with good friends dealing with the worst thing we could imagine

I started rambling about all the moments that hit me so I’ll just list them here:

- When Fitz thought he was dying after being stabbed by Laudwine and as he’s dying tells Nighteyes to keep watch. The vision of running with Nighteyes over the hill was beautiful.

- When the forming Coterie was trying to save Fitz, Chade said “No, oh no. Not my boy, not my Fitz. Please, no.” This one probably hit me the hardest. There was something so raw and human about those words. I don’t think I’ve ever been more in another world than while reading this chapter.

- Thick being there and “roaring like a bonfire” to try to save Fitz. I loved the push and pull between them this trilogy (already halfway through fools fate) and seeing thick slowly take to others a bit more.

- the coterie itself forming. This just felt like a long time coming in this book. Seeing them come together and be willing to do anything to save Fitz was amazing.

- I just love Dutiful and I’m so happy he knows everything now. Little unrelated but just had to add.",fantasy

Guards! Guards! As an entry point to Discworld,"I see a lot of recommendations for Discworld on this subreddit, but the question I always see is where to properly start! So, as someone who recently got into Discworld, I wanted to add my 2 cents and see what you all think :) 

I'll start off by saying Guards! Guards! instantly became one of my favorite books of all time. It was thrilling, clever, and completely hilarious and had me smiling on every page. Like, fully grinning while flipping through a book. In public no less! 

Sir Terry has mastered comedic timing in a way I didn't know could be achieved on a printed page. He uses so many clever, innovative tricks (the footnotes!) to construct a joke and deliver the punchline; and how incredible that a joke told thirty five years ago can land just right today! 

And the cast is just has so much heart-- even Nobby Nobbs, who probably stole it-- that by the end you feel like you've gotten drinks with them every week for the past twenty years. And they're kind of gross, but you love them. 

So, for me, I think Guards! Guards! was the perfect place to start Discworld. It sucked me in completely and I've been working my way through the city watch ever since. After completing Guards! Guards!, I did give the first two Discworld novels a try (The Color of Magic and the Light Fantastic) and while I did like them, I think they might be a bit more daunting to someone just starting Discworld, especially someone who doesn't often read fantasy (especially older fantasy). 

  
What do you guys think? Where did you start Discworld, and did you think it worked well as an entry point? I don't know much about the subseries other than City Watch so I'd also love to hear your opinions on which to read next :)",fantasy
The Martian Rec,"Hi everyone, so I just completed The Martian by Andy Weir. I loved the Science and the politics. Any space rec in that line? I don't mind action/battles too though, very much up for action if that's it (as long as theres either politics or science mixed in)

Saying I don't mind action because I absolutely loved Red Rising Series by Pierce. In fact, I think it's one of the best series I read this year. I tried Sanderson's YA space series but it was just a little too YA for me, strange cause I loved Red Rising so I'm guessing the time jumps helped massive. Asides I'll like to say RR wasn't a traditional YA series anyway. So No YA unless it's really class.

Thank you. Looking forward to the replies haha",fantasy

#Chapter 26: The Trial of Endymion Leer

&amp;nbsp;
This is perhaps the most important chapter in the book when it comes to political commentary. It’s not only Endymion Leer and Widow who are on trial but an entire ideology.

##The Warm-up to the Trial
&amp;nbsp;
Mirrlees does a fairly decent job ramping up the tension as the trial begins. The courthouse is crowded to the point that people have to settle on listening from the outside, and it’s very clear the entire crowd is expecting something to happen when Leer gets a chance to speak. 

&amp;nbsp;
It’s also very clear that there is a divide between the upper class, there to see a villain brought to justice, and the lower class, believing that the entire trial is a sham and are there to cheer as Leer will undoubtedly dazzle the silly senators with his brilliant logic. 

&amp;nbsp;
One thing that’s worth noting, and I think is somewhat relevant to our world, is that the lower-class crowd doesn’t necessarily care whether Leer is innocent. For them, he is simply justified and should be above the proceedings of the law. 

##Of Trees and Men

&amp;nbsp;
In light of the previous observation, it should come as no surprise that Leer’s speech contains an admission of guilt. By any reasonable law, this should have sealed the case and shut down any doubts, but the fact that Leer admits to the murder is treated as almost irrelevant. 

&amp;nbsp;
The bulk of Leer’s speech is one of ideology: 
&gt;""My friends, you are outcasts, though you do not know it, and you have forfeited your place on earth. For there are two races—trees and man; and for each there is a different dispensation. Trees are silent, motionless, serene. They live and die, but do not know the taste of either life or death; to them a secret has been entrusted but not revealed. But the other tribe—the passionate, tragic, rootless tree—man? Alas! he is a creature whose highest privileges are a curse. In his mouth is ever the bitter-sweet taste of life and death, unknown to the trees. 

&amp;nbsp;
We’ve seen before a similar duology, between a creature that cannot feel and a creature that is all feeling - Back in Chapter 17, when Nathaniel talks about the world-at-law. But Leer’s version is subtly different. A tree is a thing of nature, not artifice, and the men are creatures of tragedy. But Leer tells the senators that “I could not turn you into trees; but I had hoped to turn you into men” implying that being one or the other is the right way of things. 

&amp;nbsp;
His defense, then, is that he was righting an ideological wrong: the people of Lud are not as they should be, and in order to save them in the long run, the meager tenets of law can and should be ignored. This is not an uncommon mindset among radicals. The question is, is Leer really a radical? Or are his motives more basic than that?

##The Counterargument

&amp;nbsp;
The Widow’s testimony reveals the truth behind Leer’s words, and helps us reject them. 

&gt;Yes, I murdered Gibberty—and a good riddance too. I was for killing him with the sap of osiers, but the fellow you call Endymion Leer, who was always a squeamish, tenderhearted, sort of chap (if there was nothing to lose by it, that's to say) got me the death-berries and made me give them to him in a jelly, instead of the osiers."" [...] ""And it was not only because they caused a painless death that he preferred the berries. He had never before seen them at their work, and he was always a death-fancier—tasting, and smelling, and fingering death, like a farmer does samples of grain at market.”

&amp;nbsp;
The Widow is the pragmatic counterpart to Leer’s ideology-filled testament, even though they’re both pretty horrible - the Stalin to his Lenin, if you will. She exposes the Doctors motives as simple - he wanted to see what the berries will do to a man. With that context, we can see Leer’s speech in a different light. He did not “prescribe Farmer Gibberty the berries of merciful death"" due to the conviction of his beliefs, but rather for his own morbid curiosity. We can extrapolate that his other crimes had similar selfish motives, including smuggling fairy fruit into Dorimare. 

##Final Comments
&amp;nbsp;
Some things worth noting in this chapter:

* The crowd listening to Leer’s defense is upset, not because he is a murderer, but because they feel vaguely insulted by his speech. Again, the motive of selfish priorities over the public good. 
* The sailor that accompanied Endymion Leer now has a name - Sebastian Thug. I don’t think there’s any need to explain the naming choice this time around. Perhaps Mirrlees was feeling tired of subtlety. His surname appears to be at odds with his given name, though, as Sebastian comes from the Greek word for “Venerable.”
* Miss Crabapple hangs herself. Leer and the Widow are also hanged. Diggory Carp also hung himself and we were told in chapter 2 about Duke Aubrey’s fool who also hung himself. This method of death appears to be common in Dorimare. Possibly it’s alluding to the Nordic ritualistic human sacrifice to Odin. Michael Swanwick notes that some people afflicted by Dionysus’ madness end up hanging themselves in myth, but I couldn’t find any sources on that. 
* Leer describes Fairyland as “a land where the sun and the moon do not shine” Remember that one, it’s going to be important later. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
And that’s the end of Endymion Leer’s tale. But it is not the end of our story.

Tarvolon Reads a Magazine (or Two): Reviews of Clarkesworld and GigaNotoSaurus (September 2024),"I’m still chugging along reading my two regular magazines, and there was plenty of short fiction that I’m really excited to talk about this month. Let’s dive in! 

# Clarkesworld

I usually discuss each issue of *Clarkesworld* in the order that the stories are listed in the table of contents, but this issue has me mentally organizing it a bit differently. There are three stories that just seem designed to appeal to me in particular (spoiler: they did) and three more that really leaned in to weird or unsettling biology. So this month, I’m going out of order and presenting them the way they’re grouped in my head, starting with the tarvolon bait. 

The tarvolon bait did indeed start with the very first story of the issue, **The Music Must Always Play** by Marissa Lingen. This one jumped out at me from the very first line, “\[t\]he aliens took a large part of Mankato, Minnesota, with them when they went.” I love first contact stories, and this one combines first contact with a couple other themes I really enjoy. The alien visitation is a tragedy, with no extraterrestrial survivors, and the societal processing of that tragedy combines with the main character dealing with a family member’s cancer treatment to serve as a backdrop to her attempts to piece together linguistic meaning from the remains of the ship. It’s not a story that’s going to wow you with a jaw-dropping moment of convergence, but it does a great job exploring the often-frustrating rhythms of scientific research in the context of large and small-scale tragedies. 

Another story that gripped me from the moment I saw the setup was **Broken** by Laura Williams McCaffrey. It’s a tale told in reverse, starting with a digital warrior plugging back in to what has become her entire world, then slowly peeling back layers from the days she spent dealing with technological failures, and the growing suspicion that the world may not be the way she was led to believe. I love both creative story structures and tales of suppressed information, and this one came together wonderfully. 

But perhaps my favorite piece in the entire issue is **A Theory of Missing Affections** by Renan Bernardo, which blends historical research with a family drama between siblings with vastly different worldviews. One is dedicated to the study of a godlike race that has vanished and left behind a wealth of technology—with a strange proliferation of torture devices—while the other’s religion prevents her from even viewing the technological remnants for fear of gaining an incomplete understanding before the appropriate time. Their largely friendly relationship is put to the test by the closing of a travel gate that threatens to separate them forever if neither agrees to relocate to the other’s home planet. The family drama aspect is engaging, but what makes this stand out is the way the lead’s research project slowly pieces together these mystifying relics into a stunning portrait of a bygone world. 

While those three short stories were my highlights of this month’s *Clarkesworld*, there were three others that were strange or unsettling to various degrees and could easily be favorites for another reader. Perhaps the weirdest of the bunch is one of the two novelettes, **Those Who Remember the World** by Ben Berman Ghan, which lays out a bizarre, AI-controlled city full of strange biology, one that’s currently dealing with a series of inexplicable murders. The godlike AI brings into being a batlike investigator to get to the bottom of it, kicking off a dizzying plot with plenty of strangeness and a bit of romance—one that feels nothing like your typical procedural. I had a lot of fun with this one, but I suspect that readers with more of a penchant for the weird may find a new favorite here. 

A touch less dizzying but even more unsettling is **Fish Fear Me, You Need Me** by Tiffany Xue. The post-apocalyptic, flooded world concept has been done to death, but it’s soon clear that this one has a grotesque twist: most of humanity has taken to the waters and become indistinguishable from fish. The two characters at the center of the story are two of the only humans left, but one carries a tragic obsession with finding his wife that makes him intensely squeamish about one of the only reliable food sources. It’s not a story that offers a lot of answers, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. 

The final story in the issue, **A World of Milk and Promises** by R H Wesley, also features some transformational weirdness, featuring a mother alone on an alien planet, speaking in second-person to her unborn child about an older sister who in death expanded her body to provide shelter for them both. This one may reveal a bit more about what is happening than some of the others, but it certainly doesn’t tell the reader how to feel about it all, and the perspective of a mother trying to cope with loss is excellent. 

The issue’s other short story, **Those Who Remember Perfectly** by Eric Schwitzgebel is another intriguing one that’s certainly not without its own weirdness, taking place in an assisted living facility and focusing on a device that allows for alteration of memory. It’s a fascinating theme that reminds me a bit of “The Brotherhood of Montague St. Video” by Thomas Ha—one of my favorite novelettes of the year so far—but approached from the opposite angle. 

The other novelette in the issue, **The Children I Gave You, Oxalaia**, by Cirilo Lemos and translated by Thamirys Gênova, tells a science-fictional tale of prejudice and xenophobia, as the Brazilian government attempts to round up alien refugees and send them back to their home planet. There are plenty of complex interpersonal dynamics set against the backdrop of social prejudice and persecution, and it makes for a good read. It’s probably the least memorable of the issue, but there truly isn’t a bad story in the lot—-*something* has to be the least memorable. 

On the nonfiction side, the letter from the editor is a sigh of relief in text form, as Neil Clarke celebrates hitting a subscription goal and a couple Hugo victories, while reiterating that there’s plenty left to do and this is far from a time for complacency. The science article dives into reproductive technology, both the already-available and the far-off, with discussion ranging from gene editing to artificial wombs. 

The author interviews feature a pair of familiar names in Aliette de Bodard and A.C. Wise. The former hasn’t totally clicked with me in recent years, and this interview doesn’t inspire me to try her new releases, but it *does* remind me that I’ve been meaning to circle back to some of her acclaimed short fiction from the early 2010s. The latter I know more as an excellent short fiction reviewer than as an author, and her most recent novella (*Out of the Drowning Deep*) uses a host of tropes that don’t often appeal to me, and yet she talks about it in such a way that I’m curious to try it anyways. 

# GigaNotoSaurus 

The one longish story in this month’s *GigaNotoSaurus* was on the shorter side for the publication, coming in just over 5,000 words. **Here in the Glittering Black, There is Hope** by Monte Lin is a sci-fi tale in which the main characters scrape out a living with long-haul space contracts for wealthy clients who can live 50 years without appearing to age a day. It is in part a story of inequality, spotlighting unfair and out-of-touch behavior that the lead’s patrons still manage to see as magnanimous. But it’s also a story of found family, and the pressures on a group of people who know that every job they take will mean returning to an Earth where their only living acquaintances are those patrons. But while there were some really promising elements here, it’s a story I would’ve liked to see with a little more time for those elements to breathe.

Hello! new (ish) to reading and even newer to this subreddit. Looking for technomancy themed book.,"Title, doesn't have to be a series or long or short I will take anything really haha, a plus if it's a beginner friendly book if that makes sense or has queer characters as I am gay myself and love to see that in content I consume. Thank you for reading! ^-^",fantasy

Mental health found family book? ,"Does anyone know a fantasy book that deals with mental illness and has found family? Queer lit would be appreciated, but i can also go without. I can read high fantasy, but I'd like there to be more of a focus on a character healing in a fantasy setting.

Just some good old comfort would be nice. I've just finished 'on other lands' by Sarah Brennan which I liked, but I also like books like Gideon the ninth and house in the cerulean sea etc. ",fantasy
August Bingo Readings and Reviews,"My goal this year is to complete 7 cards this year, with a few themed cards being Hard Mode, Progression Fantasy, Self-Published, New-To-Me Authors and Award Winning Books/Series cards. Here is my August reading, a total of 15 books, with corresponding bingo categories with HM = hard mode:



**The Path of Ascension (The Path of Ascension #1) - C. Mantis** - I knew nothing of this book heading into it and ended up loving it. Gave me Cradle vibes with the fighting + magic + aspects and the way they ascend. The action was great and not repetitive despite all the rift fighting, the worldbuilding was solid and writing was good. Curious how the relationship between Matt and Liz develops. 5/5. First in a Series (HM), Dreams, Self Published, Romantasy, Multi-POV



**The Path of Ascension 2 (The Path of Ascension #2) - C. Mantis** - Another great book in this series. Love the dynamic between Matt, Liz and Aster, and the book is trying to be deeper than just an action fantasy. Matt faces the consequences of his choices, and having a damaged character like Duke Water's ward Camille join them was a good dynamic. Can't wait to read more. 4.5/5. Self Published, Romantasy, Multi-POV



**The Book of Elsewhere - Keanu Reeves &amp; China Mieville** - I'm conflicted about this book. I like the story - an immortal soldier who can't stay dead finally finds another person who comes back to life - but the storytelling was unusual. It bounced between timelines and POVs as it told the story of B - some were interesting but others weren't. Other reviews mention the writing being uneven and unfocused, and I definitely agree with that. However, the worldbuilding, prose and premise were all quality. 3/5. Under the Surface, Prologues &amp; Epilogues, Multi-POV (HM), Published in 2024



**The Lesser Dead - Christopher Buehlman**  - Really good book about vampires in 1980s New York. Definitely dark, violent vampires. Was a short read but the audiobook was excellent quality. It ends abruptly but fits with the nature of the story. 4/5. Under the Surface, Dreams, 



**Dying World (Magitech Legacy #1) - Chris Fox**  - A solid book with potential. Definitely scratched the sword-and-laser itch, pairing a lot of magic with tech. Interested in reading more. 3.5/5. First in a Series, Dreams, Prologue &amp; Epilogue, Self-Published, Space Opera



**Summoner 12 (Summoner #12) - Eric Vall** - A nice rebound to this series after I thought the last 2 books were a bit of a letdown. This book was more focused with a better plot as well. Griff is still the biggest Gary Stu out there, but at least this book reigned him back in and taught him delegation is a useful trait. 3.5/5. Dreams, Self Published



**Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archives #2) - Brandon Sanderson** - Re-read before Wind and Truth comes out later this year. This book was as good, if not better than the first in the series. It had some truly epic moments that really stuck in the memory. Also, Shallen was much less annoying in this book, as she had more to do with the Ghostbloods storyline. The book still feels a little bloated as there is still quite a bit of comedown between action, but the story is just so good. 5/5. Dreams, Prologue &amp; Epilogue (HM), Multi-POV (HM), Character With a Disability (HM), Reference Material (HM)



**A Home Called Blade’s Rest (Blade’s Rest #2) - Tom Watts** - Not as good of a sequel as I was hoping. I enjoyed the town building, but the drama involving the Duke with the rival settlement wasn't that interesting to me. Not a bad book by any means, but just didn't click with me this time around. 3/5. Self-Published, Orcs Trolls &amp; Goblins, Set in a Small Town



**Guardians of Glyndor - Nicoleclaire C** - I received an ARC copy of this book from the author for an honest review. I really liked this book a lot. It started with a strong opening chapter that grabbed the attention and introduced you to the world and one of the main characters. Its YA, coming-of-age genre and had the feel (to me) of the Magicians by Lev Grossman but not depressing and insufferable. The romance was built up nicely and paced realistically. 3.5/5. First in a Series, Prologue &amp; Epilogue (HM), Self-Published (HM), Romantasy, Mult-POV, Published in 2024 (HM), PoC Author (HM), Reference Material (HM)



**Midnight Mass - F. Paul Wilson** - Stephen King/Salem's Lot-esque vampire story where the vamps were cruel, lethal and deadly. The story was fast-paced and interesting. Not very deep from a characters standpoint, but a very enjoyable read. 4/5. Alliterative Title, Dreams (HM), Multi-PO (HM), Survival (HM), Set in a Small Town (HM)



**Night Shift - Stephen King** - Probably the best short stories collection I've read. Not all were great though. Really enjoyed Children of the Corn and Jerusalem Lot. Lawnmower Man was a disappointment though and wasn't too big on Graveyard Shift. The Boogeyman was great, though the ending was a little lackluster, but the story itself did an amazing job to capture such creppiness. Both Battleground and Strawberry Spring were well done as well. Grey Matter and I Am the Doorway were forgettable. 4/5. 5 Short Stories (HM)



**Soul Harvest (Dread Knight #2) - Sarah Hawke** - Definitely a fast-paced, popcorn read. Not overly deep in terms of characters but the action came hot and heavy. 3.5/5. Prologue &amp; Epilogue (HM), Self-Published, Romantasy (HM), Multi-POV, Published in 2024, Survival (HM), Judge a Book By Its Cover 



**Mark of the Fool 6 - J.M. Clarke** - I feel like this book may have been the best in the series. Claygon coming to life and gaining more sentience was interesting and funny. Speaking of funny, Thundars date was hilarious. The action was great throughout, not too repetitive either. And having a MC like Alex being thoughtful and super competent is refreshing. 5/5. Self-Published, Multi-POV (HM), Published in 2024, Character with a Disability (HM)



**The Last Shield - Cameron Johnston** - My favourite book of 2024 thus far. Really lived up to the billing of Die Hard in a medieval fantasy setting. And it worked so well. Briar was the perfect grizzled character, and in a relatively small book, was able to give so many awesome moments. Loved Kester's evolution, loved the unique fight scenes and even the start, which some reviewers thought was a little slow/meandering. Cameron Johnston is must read for me. 5/5. Under the Surface, Criminals (HM), Multi-POV, Published 2024, Character with a Disability (HM), Survival (HM)



**Undead Kingdom (Revenant’s Revenge #1)** - This book was good, but darker, more sinister than I was looking for. The titular revenant lives up to his goal of wanting revenge. Though he wants revenge on the noble who carelessly killed him, rather than murdering or torturing him, the revenant wants to bring his whole kingdom down around him. It means a lot of murder of the populace, which essentially means he's killing undeserving people, much like the noble did to him. 2.5/5. First in a Series, Prologue &amp; Epilogue, Self-Published, Orcs, Trolls &amp; Goblins

Book recs/help?,"I have recently started a book club and we are having our first meeting soon, the only problem is that I have the most fantasy genre experience and all the other members have very little or no knowledge of this genre.

I don’t want our first few books to be series especially since a few of the members have never really read fantasy books, so I was thinking maybe starting with a novella or a YA book, since most tend to be shorter but I’m not really sure, I also was thinking something with minimal smut.

I love reading and I’m excited to start this but my mind is just blanking on books, especially ones not part of series😅

So if anyone has any beginner recommendations that would be super helpful, thank you! ",fantasy
Who's your favourite character(s) to read about who you would never want to meet in real life?,"Some characters are great and compelling to read about who I would, under no circumstances, want to meet in real life. The main trio in Beyond Redemption are a great example. Who would be your pick(s)?",fantasy
Anna Smith Spark reading order,"I've been meaning to read something by Anna Smith Spark because I've heard good things. I'm intrigued by *A Woman of the Sword*, which was written after her *Empires of Dust* trilogy and is set in the same world.  
Does anyone know if *A Woman of the Sword* spoils the events of the trilogy that came before it? Or can you read it first?",fantasy
Borrowing Names,"So I’ve started reading the Wheel Of Time and something I noticed is that a lot of names of minor characters and/or historical figures also show up in some of GRRM’s works as minor characters and/or historical characters. Is this an intentional reference, and do a lot of fantasy authors do this? I’m trying to read all of the most iconic fantasy series, but I’m only 18 so I haven’t had that much time to actually do so. Here’s 3 examples from early Eye Of The World (which I just finished yesterday): Aemon, Hightower, Alys
I also know GRRM borrowed the name Daeron from Tolkien ",fantasy
Mark Lawrence recommendations,"Hi, years ago I enjoyed The Broken Empire trilogy a lot, it was very (grim) dark and felt different from a lot of other stuff when it came to the main character, plot and structure. Started Red Queen's War but it felt more like ""regular fantasy"" for lack of a better word, certainly less dark, and I believe I stopped somewhere in the second book. Tried Red Sister from his third series but also wasn't feeling it, it felt almost young adult with the school setting so I didn't get very far either.

I see he has released a bunch of new books since then, and I was wondering if it makes sense for me to pick any of them up? Are any of them more similar to Broken Empire? And will I be missing out on things not having read his other stuff considering there is supposed to be some overarching narrative across the series if I remember correctly.

  
Thanks in advance!",fantasy
Looking for more dark YA!,"Hi, I'm looking for more dark fantasy books with YA characters (doesn't have to be YA in theme or complexity). Something with some combat and suffering and gore. The darker the better. Well written female characters are a huge plus.

Some books I've read in a similar vein:

**The Book of the Ancestor** (starting with Red Sister) - ❤️❤️❤️ loved it. I want more books like this, basically. This level of violence or higher

**Fourth Wing** - 🫤 didn't love this. It was okay, the action sequences were pretty good, but there was too much romance and I didn't think the writing was very good

**House of Hollow** - ❤️ liked this a lot. Less combat focused but had some great body horror

**Mistborn** - 👍 Liked it (not sure it's really YA besides Vin), good story and action but preferably looking for something more violent/gory",fantasy
Recommendations for Horror fantasy with female main character?,Preferably older characters. And I’m not really a fan of romance centric stories which I too often find stories about women are.,fantasy
Has anybody else read The buried giant?,"I don't know if it counts as fantasy, there are supernatural elements but they are mostly simbolic. But, for the sake of the review, I'll count it as fantasy. 

This book stabbed me and then gently cradled my corpse. I don't know how else to describe it. I may be an emotional person but it has been three months at least since the last novel that physically hurt me, and that's a compliment.

I know the plot is apparently simple, and on the other hand it's not a long book, but it is full of mystery until the last chapters. The protagonists are very different from each other, they're all realistic, the relationships between them are solid and well done even though the story takes place in a short time. Each of them is engaging, with their own goals and contrasting motivations (and the resulting conflicts were heartbreaking) but perfectly sensible and consistent with the characterization of each. I adore well written characters, even with the thinnest plot, so this was definetely one of the best things about the novel. The ending was a blow to my heart, and the slight note of sweetness in the epilogue muffles the bitter parts without diminishing their power.

The best part was the atmosphere. The feeling is that someone took Excalibur (the one by Bernard Cornwell), The Death of Virgil and The Seventh Seal, shook vigorously and immersed everything in a dream. In fact, even though it has a historical setting (and the historical details and descriptions were very much appreciated), it has from the beginning to (especially) the end a dreamlike and poetic tone that has bewitched me. It made it go from ""intriguing, pleasant idea"" to ""amazing book that is hard to put down"".

Maybe I say this because it seems like it was specifically made for me, but it deserves more fame and more appreciation. If you are looking for a story that sucks you in and metaphorically stabs you in the gut, this novel is the perfect answer.",fantasy
Short Fiction Book Club: Sturgeon Award winners,"Welcome to today’s session of Season 3 of Short Fiction Book Club! Not sure what that means? No problem. [We’ve got an FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1embc20/short_fiction_book_club_were_back_for_season/) explaining who we are, what we do, and when we do it. Mostly that’s talk about short fiction, on r/Fantasy, on Wednesdays.

# Today’s Session: Sturgeon Award winners

[**Bears Discover Fire**](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/bears-discover-fire/) by Terry Bisson (1991) (4700 words)

&gt;I was driving with my brother, the preacher, and my nephew, the preacher’s son, on I-65 just north of Bowling Green when we got a flat. It was Sunday night and we had been to visit Mother at the Home. We were in my car. The flat caused what you might call knowing groans since, as the old-fashioned one in my family (so they tell me), I fix my own tires, and my brother is always telling me to get radials and quit buying old tires.

[**The Edge of the World**](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/fiction/the-edge-of-the-world/) by Michael Swanwick (1990) (6000 words)

&gt;The day that Donna and Piggy and Russ went to see the Edge of the World was a hot one. They were sitting on the curb by the gas station that noontime, sharing a Coke and watching the big Starlifters lumber up into the air, one by one, out of Toldenarba AFB. The sky rumbled with their passing. There’d been an incident in the Persian Gulf, and half the American forces in the Twilight Emirates were on alert.

[**In Joy, Knowing the Abyss Behind**](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/in-joy-knowing-the-abyss-behind-part-1-of-2/) by Sarah Pinsker (2014) (8300 words)

&gt;""Don't leave."" The first time he said it, it sounded like a command. The tone was so unlike George, Millie nearly dropped her hairbrush.

# Upcoming sessions

On **Wednesday, September 25**, we will be hosting our Monthly Discussion. There’s no slate, it’s just a chance to drop in and discuss the short fiction that’s been on your mind lately.

For our first October session, I’ll turn it over to u/tarvolon:

&gt;Little known-fact: I joined up with u/Nineteen_Adze to start SFBC for the purpose of cajoling people into reading all the stories at the top of my 2022 Hugo nominating ballot. We read “That Story Isn’t the Story” as part of the Hugo Readalong that year, but for my favorites from lesser-known venues, it’s been a slower process, biding my time and waiting for an appropriately thematic pairing. And as we enter into spooky season, I’ve finally found one that I’m very excited about—we’ll be casting our eyes to the waters for a pair of unsettling tales featuring mythological sea creatures.

On **Wednesday, October 2,** we’ll be reading the following two stories for our **Dark Waters** session:

[**The Incident at Veniaminov**](https://mermaidsmonthly.com/2021/05/26/the-incident-at-veniaminov/) by Mathilda Zeller (10500 words)

&gt;The summer had finally reached our island. We shed layers of knitted wool and sinew-sewn fur and let the wind move across our bare arms and legs — a vulnerable feeling after being perpetually covered for most of the year. Fishermen were out at all hours of the day or night. With the darkness only covering two hours in twenty-four, there was little need to stop; our people moved with the strange rhythms of the far north. From the tundra at the top of the world to the jungles in the south, this is where we had gathered. If anyone were to visit long enough, they’d notice we were different.

&gt;But no one ever stayed that long. Not unless they were one of us.

[**A Lullaby of Anguish**](https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/a-lullaby-of-anguish/) by Marie Croke (6400 words)

&gt;We used to cage them in the tide pools, when they were still small enough to capture in our little hands. Pull them out and snap photos that we could pretend to sell to magazines just like Papa. Them, gasping for breath, unable to see, fins fluttering. We would photograph until they began to loosen, go limp. And then we would dunk them again, let them freshen up. Try again.

I'll add a few prompts for today's chat to get us started, but feel free to add your own! ",fantasy

 Fantasy recommendations : small standalones with magic and character development ,"Hey everyone, 
I'm looking for fairly small fantasy standalones (300-400 pages) with a soft magic system and good bunch of characters to get my mother(55F) into reading. Bonus points if it's available as a well narrated audiobook!
The catch is, being an avid fantasy reader myself, I go for series or longer books with complex plots and thus I cannot make a decision here. All I can currently think of is ""The Hobbit"" by JRR Tolkien. I'd love a few more suggestions so I can do a sort of ""book of the month"" style reading for her.

Edit : it'd be nice if romance component is not very prominent or mostly absent for these recommendations, in her own words. 

Thanks! ",fantasy
Bingo Review: Tales from the Folly,"Tales from the Folly by Ben Aaronovitch

"Assassins Fate - ""The Fool"" is acting Mad Shady...","I'm Rereading/listening to the ""Assassin's Fate"" audiobook again after a decade or so from my first read. This time, as usually happens after a second or more look at things, I'm noticing some things that I didn't the first time.

I was at the part when Fitz, The Fool(as Amber), Lent, Perseverance, and Spark(Ash) are boarding the LiveShip Paragon, whose figure head, unknown to Fitz, was already carved in his likeness by Amber. 

Additionally, as they're meeting Captain Brashen, Althea and the crew they're assuming that Fitz and Amber are a couple. Which is expressed by Brashen by constantly referring to Amber as he speaks to Fitz as ""his woman."" To the point where they insist on rooming Fitz and Amber together even when Fitz politely insinuates he would rather be down in a hammock with Perseverance to which Brashen says, 'we would never think about separating you from your lady.'

Then to top it off, Amber sitting in Paragon's arms starts telling him that they're going to avenge ""their daughters"" death, further feeding the idea that Fitz and her/him are together and the biological parents of little Bee, not even acknowledging that Molly is her real Mother! To which Fitz feels a major disrespect to Molly when he hears it, but once again, using the internal excuse of not hurting the Fools feelings in that moment, keeps it inside and says nothing to correct it.

I'm starting to notice that ""the Fool's"" behavior is definitely disrespectful to Fitz in this regard because a friend would never force ""their perception"" or their ""personal wishes for that relationship"" out into the public and cause discomfort and/or emotional distress on someone they consider their Best Friend.

What do you think about this behavior?

Would You Feel it's ok for you or your Best Friend to act or say these things to other people without their consent?

Are there any books you read where you missed something that SHOULD have been obvious?,"I have two that come to mind.

I was half-way through reading the first *Maximum Ride* book before I realized the narrator was a girl! Not a huge deal, just a sudden swerve I felt kind of stupid for not realizing.

On the other hand, I was half way through the second book of *The Bartimaeus Trilogy* before it finally clicked that magicians were NOT a secret society! They were an open and obvious part of the world not hidden from ""normal people.* I can blame that assumption a little on the HP books, but still!

Any other examples?",fantasy
Adaptations,"Why does it seem like all fantasy adaptations have gone bad now? The only good one I can think of is Lord Of The Rings. Right now we have 3 of the most iconic fantasy writers (Tolkien, Jordan, and George RR Martin), having adaptations that are poorly received. Why does this keep on happening? Is fantasy just that difficult to adapt well? Do studios just not care about quality anymore, only money?",fantasy
Looking for more complex relationships between female characters in fantasy,"I would like to discover more complicated relationships between female characters in fantasy books—ones that shift between admiration and resentment, empathy and animosity, where they try to kill each other one minute and save each other the next. Some examples that I really adored:

1. Navani Kholin and Raboniel (Stormlight Archive)
2. Kaul Shae and Ayt Mada (Green Bone Saga)
3. Baru Cormorant and Xate Yawa (The Masquerade)
4. Phèdre nó Delaunay and Melisande Shahrizai (Kushiel's Legacy)
5. Fang Runin and Su Daji (The Poppy War)

I would personally prefer dynamics where a) the women are on opposite sides of a conflict and b) one of the women is older and more experienced and the other is younger (like all the examples), but I'm fine with those requirements not being exactly met as long as the relationship between the female characters is really complex.

I'm also open to good f/f enemies to lovers or lovers-to-enemies recs, even if they're not exactly what I'm asking above. I have already read The Jasmine Throne (though personally, even though I loved Malini and Priya's relationship, &gt;!I wouldn't describe it as enemies to lovers because there's always mutual respect and (for the most part) honesty between them and their goals always align!&lt;, or at least that's how it is in the first book, I haven’t picked up the second one yet), so no need to suggest that one.

Edit:

A big thanks to everyone who shared recommendations! I've got a long list now, so I'll put them all in the original post (and will update it for as long as people send more suggestions) to keep everything in one place:

Space fantasy book recommendations,"Looking for sci fi books that include fantasy, as in with elves and dwarves and the such. ",fantasy
After the first law trilogy recommendations ,"As said before, looking for books that are similar - not so much as the plot, or style of writing but more the character building .. the use of language (swear words) the grittiness…the dark ness. The humour.. I love fantasy so much, epic fantasy and high fantasy, but I do notice I struggle to find books that are truely what I’m looking for. My favourite fantasy books or all time which I think are so under rated and don’t get talked about as much as I’d think, are the ravens shadow books by Anthony Ryan… ei blood song (obviously the best) but although people don’t love tower lord and queen of fire the same way as blood song I still felt they were amazing. Then the ravens blade two books after I felt went in a similar direction as blood song and I felt were insane again. I think in a way the bloody nine and vaelin are similar characters too. Hard men who don’t particularly like the way they can act when they turn. But same kind of grittyness, good character building. The darkness and dirtiness and rawness and language. I love king killer chronicles although completely different. So much more innocent but with dark dark under stones, also much more beautiful in a way; and of course the gentlemen bastards… say less. Probably the evil twin or terry prachet in the way it’s sooo funny and strange and quirky. I’ve tried and failed many times to read mark lawrence.. I know it’s supposed to be so good and I did like it but couldn’t love it and tried hard, malazan I’m reading now but have no clue what’s going on, I’ve re read from the start each time I feel confused and my brain can’t hack it. I did like the fareeer books, which I’ve read and felt were amazing.. please help me I am lost without a book and cannot handle not being emerged into an alternate universe!!!

What are the illustrations in the Farseer Trilogy like?,"
I’ve just finished Royal Assassin on my kindle and I’m absolutely adoring this series. Just saw there are illustrated editions though, and I have had some troubles picturing Buckkeep and what’s it like inside it so I was super curious. Are there many illustrations inside each book or just a couple? Is there some way I can see them?",fantasy
Overlooked source of classic fantasy: Poems,"I often see people here asking about older, pre-*Lord of the Rings* fantasy; and there are always many great replies.

But one form of older fantasy gets (understandably) overlooked here: old fantasy poetry.

I'm not talking epic, long-form poems—not *Beowulf*, *The Faerie Queene*, or the Odyssey. I mean read-in-one-sitting poems.

Anyway, I'd love to hear from everyone what old fantasy poems you'd recommend. And if you don't have any to recommend, I'd still love to hear your thoughts.

And I want to introduce more people to these kinds of poems, so below I've excerpted snippets of some ones I know, as tasters, with links if you want to check them out in full.

""[GOBLIN MARKET](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44996/goblin-market)"" by Christina Rossetti (1859)

&gt;""Lie close,"" Laura said, pricking up her golden head:  
""We must not look at goblin men, we must not buy their fruits:  
Who knows upon what soil they fed their hungry thirsty roots?""  
""Come buy,"" call the goblins hobbling down the glen.

""[THE CREMATION OF SAM McGEE](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45081/the-cremation-of-sam-mcgee)"" by Robert Service (1907)

By the men who moil for gold;  
The Arctic trails have their secret tales  
That would make your blood run cold.

""[THE FAIRIES](https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/fairies/)"" by William Allingham (1850)

&gt;They stole little Bridget for seven years long;  
When she came down again her friends were all gone.  
They took her lightly back, between the night and morrow;  
They thought that she was fast asleep, but she was dead with sorrow.

""[THE JUMBLIES](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54364/the-jumblies)"" by Edward Lear (1871)

&gt;Far and few, far and few  
Are the lands where the Jumblies live;  
Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,  
And they went to sea in a Sieve.

""[THE LATE PASSENGER](https://www.ronnowpoetry.com/contents/lewiscs/LatePassenger.html)"" by C. S. Lewis (1948)

&gt;Noah tumbled up on deck and out he put his head;  
His face went grey, his knees were loosed, he tore his beard and said,  
""Look, look! It would not wait. It turns away. It takes its flight.  
Fine work you've made of it, my sons, between you all tonight!""

""[THE TRUE NATURE OF GNOMES](http://yourdailycslewis.blogspot.com/2004/10/true-nature-of-gnomes.html)"" by C. S. Lewis (1946)

In a silence unbroken till the planet cracks,  
Their sinewy bodies through the dense continuum  
Move without resistance and leave no tracks.

""[JABBERWOCKY](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky)"" by Lewis Carroll (1871)

&gt;And, as in uffish thought he stood,  
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,  
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,  
And burbled as it came!

""[THE KRAKEN](https://poets.org/poem/kraken)"" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1830)

far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,  
his ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep  
the Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee…

""[THE VAMPIRE](https://poets.org/poem/vampire-0)"" by Rudyard Kipling (1897)

&gt;A fool there was and he made his prayer  
(Even as you or I!)  
To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair,  
(We called her the woman who did not care),  
But the fool he called her his lady fair—  
(Even as you or I!)

""[SONG OF THE MEN'S SIDE](https://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/song_of_mens.html)"" by Rudyard Kipling (1910)

&gt;Tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan,

(And it is not right) that The Beast should master Man;  
So he went to the Children of the Night.  
He begged a Magic Knife of their make for our sake.  
When he begged for the Knife they said:  
""The price of the Knife you would buy is an eye!""  
And that was the price he paid.

Shopping Buddy,"I originally posted this in r/IDontWorkHereLady, but it was suggested that I repost it here as y'all might enjoy it as well...

This was a number of years ago when there were still bookstores besides Barnes &amp; Nobles. I was pursuing the SciFi/Fantasy section when a lady comes in dragging her son with her. She loudly starts asking if the kid would like this to read this book or another book all the while the boy was being quiet and was obviously embarrassed by the whole thing. She catches me looking at them and says rather angerly, ""What book would you recommend for my son to read?"" I told her that I don't work here but then ignoring her, I ask the son what he is into. He mumbles sports. I asked him does he want a serious book or a funny one? His mom jumps back in, ""He just needs something more than 100 pages."" I gestured with my hand for her to be quiet, and I wait for him to answer. He again mumbles funny. So, I proceed to show him a couple of easy readers that are:

1. More than 100 pages
2. Have sports (or sport related)
3. Are funny

By the time I am done the kid is a chatty as can be, excited about the book he chose (*Another Fine Myth* by Robert Asprin), and the mom is still fuming. I am certain that I stepped in something I shouldn't have, but anytime I can get someone new into reading while simultaneously pissing off an entitled someone else, that's a good day in my book. \[Pun intended\]",fantasy

What is your opinion about the order in which to read Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere books ? I would like to maximise enjoyment and minimize spoilers,"I came across a post today which was recommending an order to read the Cosmere universe. It mentioned that the chronological order might lead to spoilers. I would not want spoilers.

I have read Ellantris so far and have bought a lot of his books out of excitement for the fantasy genre. I would like to know what the best reading orders are.

I know Brandon Sanderson himself made a video recommending a reading order once, but I stopped watching it midway as he was about to describe what some of the books are about. I like going into a book, knowing nothing other than the title, but at the same time, don't want to run into spoilers while I am reading the books in a random way.",fantasy
Does anyone have a decent recap/summary of Ordinary Monsters? ,"The second book in the Talents Trilogy, Bringer of Dust, has just come out, but before I read it I feel like I need a recap of the first book (it’s crazy that’s it’s been 2 years since it came out). I’ve tried looking online but can’t find anything, not even on the main book recap sites I sometimes use. Thanks in advance ",fantasy
Random guy on the internet gives his opinion on By the Sword by Mercedes Lackey,"I planned on making a bunch of short reviews for the bingo challenge but I wanted to say a lot of things for this one in particular so it’s a separate review. Note that I get very rambly during this review and my thoughts might be all over the place so hope you don’t mind. Warning: spoilers for a nearly 2 decade old book, some naughty language and a whole lot of yapping ahead. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s actually start. 

I’ve heard plenty of good things about Lackey so I started off with this standalone story. I loved Lackey’s prose. It’s also very reader-friendly. It’s simple enough for anyone to anyone to follow without being amateur, descriptive enough to paint a very vivid picture and not overly flowery that the story drags on. It feels like a classic fantasy novel and she really gets us into the character’s heads. 

Lackey does a great job getting you to sympathise for Kerowyn and we get a great appreciation of how unfulfilled Kero feels and her desire to be more than a traditional housewife. Reading the blurb behind the book, I thought the whole story was going to be Kero’s journey in saving her brother’s bride after she was kidnapped. And it did deliver on that… by page 140ish. Yes main story the book promised consists of roughly 100 pages out of this 900 page book. Granted the blurb did say it was the start of her journey so I guess that’s my fault but I’m blaming the blurb for being misleading. 

I’m sure you’re wondering how a girl with next to zero combat and tracking training manage to rescue the bride and kill a bunch of well-armed bandits who incapacitated every man in her keep. Well she received a magic sword called Need (tf is that name) from her grandmother that just straight up took over her body and did all the work. How convenient. Also this sword is made to protect and work exclusively for women and kills only men. That’s not problematic at all.

After that, she decides to  train with her grandmother and partner Tarma to be a mercenary and abandon her family since they don’t approve of her refusing to conform to their views of feminity. And that’s it. She completely forgets about her family for the rest of the book, including her brother whom she’s supposedly close to and who’s bride she just saved, and never reconciled with them. There’s also this plot point where the bride’s kidnapping was masterminded by her uncle or something as an excuse for him to consolidate power but it never went anywhere since it was completely forgotten (though tbf this story is set in a wider universe so maybe it’ll be touched upon in a different book).

I really don’t like what they did with Kero from this point onward. Throughout the first third of the book, Kerowyn is a stereotypical strong independent woman that’s not like the other girls and she hates the very idea of traditional feminity. Not just her, but her grandmother and Tarma, are constantly criticizing the idea of traditional feminity and are lowkey insulting to any woman who wants to have a more traditionally feminine lifestyle. Her views are never challenged either so she remains firmly entrenched in her disdain towards traditionally domestic women. Thank god this sentiment is only really present in the first third so I don’t have to deal with that for the rest of the book. 

My biggest issue with Kero here is that she was set up to be an underdog but she ended up being a massive mary sue. I don’t like to use mary sue; I find it overused and its meaning has been distorted by misused but Kero is a quintessential mary sue. She never struggles and everything comes easy for her. Of course she happens to have prodigious fighting talent and picks up everything Tarma teaches her instantly. The story makes sure you know this with how often Tarma fawns over how Kero is her best student, she picks everything up so quickly blah blah blah.

There’s this really cool plot point where Need exerts a mental compulsion on Kero because they’re bonded or something and keeps trying to take over to fulfill its own ends. This has potential to create some interesting conflicts where she loses control to her sword and has to wrestle with its influence. But no, Kero trains her psychic powers in a few weeks so she can out-will the sword which just gives up, completely throwing that conflict out the window. Oh yes did I forget to mention? Kero has psychic superpowers. Don’t worry she barely uses them so she might as well not have them. It’s shown to have potential to be really op, especially now that she has such control over it, but she barely uses it. Yes I know she’s scared of coming across a more powerful psychic who’ll exploit her ability but her ability is criminally underused. She only really uses it to have secret conversations with another psychic (who’ll become relevant later). It’s not even necessary since as long as one of them is psychic, you can still communicate with each other so that was pointless. 

Later on, she has a sort of love interest, a sexist noble called Daren. They start of as training rivals and after their mutual dislike and refusal to work together incites consequence that knocks some sense into them and brings them closer together. Revolutionary stuff. The lovestruck Daren wants to marry Kero and bring her back to court because she’s so cool and they have lots of great sex. Meanwhile, Kero likes Daren as a good friend but doesn’t share the same romantic attraction even in spite of losing her virginity to Daren (though that can’t be true considering how much the story dick rides her before this). Of course, Kero being the strong female character that she is doesn’t take too kindly to the idea of being a *gag* noblewoman and goes full girlboss on Daren. In all honesty, that scene was actually well written and was an effective way for Daren to realise that he’d be forcing his friend, whom he grows to respect, to be something that she wasn’t. I find it funny that this side character who’s relevant for like a quarter of the book undergoes a greater character than the main protagonist herself in her own origin story. Ultimately, their relationship didn’t go anyway and I liked their depiction of a first love that ended on good terms. 

The book gets so much better by the second third when Kero finally becomes a mercenary. She has visibly matured in the time skip. Those annoying characteristics of her from the first third are no longer present and she becomes not just bearable but a character I want to root for.  It’s so refreshing to see Kero in her element, working comfortably with others just like her. She’s resourceful, resilient and looks out for others. Her dedication causes her to put her job above all else, which leads to bouts of loneliness. Rejoice for our main character finally has actual character that isn’t ew I hate traditional feminity. There’s also plenty of great action set pieces which Lackey manages to make exciting without feeling draggy which is something a lot of stories fail to do well. 

Later on, Kero meets a Herald (don’t ask me what that is. I couldn’t be damned to pay attention to the lore dump and this book assumes that you already have pre-existing knowledge from previous books)
named Eldan. She has to help him get back to his nation and they end up growing close through the experience which eventually leads to romance. While I personally felt that she fell in love a bit too fast with Eldan but it doesn’t really harm the story in any way. And besides it did make sense that she’d fall for him. Eldan isn’t a sexist dickhead. He trusts her and respects her autonomy but is also willing to pitch in when she needs his help. Plus he shares similar psychic powers with her (Remember when I mentioned that? Truly one of the Chekov’s gun moments of all time) which allows them to grow even closer thanks to them having super intimate mind sex. ~~I too love some steamy mind sex.~~ Moving swiftly on, Kero realises that she has to leave Eldan behind and draw away their pursuers (did I forget to mentioned that they’re being hunted down this whole time) so that he can go home safely. So she makes the hard decision and reluctantly leaves him behind. 

After that a bunch of other shit happens that I’ll just speedrun through. She ends up on the run after she walks out on her mercenary group that is now being led by an idiot after the old captain died. This was an actually great scene. You can truly feel her desperation as she’s fighting against the elements and fatigue all with the looming dread of potential pursuers catching up. It’s a really tense and dramatic scene. And even when she finds respite at the court of mercenaries (yes they have an actual court where they settle legal disputes) there’s the immense stress of having to present her case followed by an agonising wait for the council’s decision. This has got to be my favourite scene in this whole damn book. It was a bit anti-climatic at the end when she wins the case but it feels so damn good. 

At this point on, a whole lot of nothing happens and the pacing takes a nosedive. This is a major problem I had with the whole book. The book isn’t really one full story but more of a series of short stories. This episodic nature makes the story feel disjointed and the pacing is just all over the pace, making it a bit hard to get through. 

Also, every time Kero faces a problem, it gets solved trivially. Kero’s sexist sword refuses to kill a priestess that’s about to kill her? Said priestess gets knocked out at the last second. She’s stuck with an incompetent captain? Kero just walks out with zero consequence. Said captain wants to punish Kero for walking out on her? The rest of her mercenary group suddenly grows a backbone and call her out before using some obscure rule to remove her from power. Kero gets arrested and faced with exile after her morally-questionable sword once again screws her over by almost killing an abusive city guard? Her mercenary friends swoop in and bail her out with convenient witness testimonies. Needs funds to run her mercenary group? Her cousins who have had zero contact with her up till this point come in out of nowhere to give her top-quality horses to sell and use for themselves. 

Anyways this review has gone on far too long so let’s get to the third and final part where Kero (who’s now captain of the mercenary group because she totally deserved to become one) and Daren (look who finally decided to be relevant again) end up fighting a war. Yeah a whole ass war. You know the kind of stuff we’d normally spend developing during the course of the whole book but screw me I guess. Anyways Kero reunites with Eldan, Daren develops superpowers of his own, deus ex machina comes in clutch, Kero randomly becomes a Herald out of nowhere and the book ends. The latter third just ramped the stakes and pacing up to eleven out of nowhere before ending unceremoniously. 

Overall this book was honestly not that bad in spite of what my complaints would entail. The first third was infuriating, the second third was great and the final third was kinda forgettable but mildly entertaining. So 1.5/3 I guess? I can see why people like the book. The writing was stellar, the world building was amazing and an engaging story, especially the individual middle third arcs when read in isolation. It’s not a terrible book but I had quite a lot of things to complain about, namely Kero in the first third, the incredibly rushed ending, very uneven pacing and a few abandoned plot threads. Still if you can get past the painful first third, by the Sword is a decent enough book that high fantasy fans would enjoy. 5.5/10

Book Review: Bringer of Dust (The Talents Trilogy #2) by JM Miro,"**TL;DR Review:** Addictive and enthralling, but not for the faint of heart. Deeper, darker, and twistier—an excellent second installment in this gothic historical fantasy trilogy.

https://preview.redd.it/w0xoabknwepd1.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8641e3122abea3aca1b8d91218b04bcb78cec873

# Full Review:

JM Miro is back and in fine form in the second book of *The Talents Trilogy!*

*Bringer of Dust* picks up shortly after the traumatic and bloody ending of *Ordinary Monsters.* The children we fell in love with in the first book are continuing to explore the dark gothic world painted for us in these pages, this time heading through new and exotic locales—Spain, Italy, France, and more.

We’re shown where each of the characters from the last book are—hunting new talented children, searching for answers into the magical abilities that compel dark entities to hunt them, and trapped in a realm of horrors and undead spirits.

Then we’re introduced to new characters: a young Roma girl who can control bones, both living and dead; sadistic children raised to be killers to serve the mysterious Abbess; and an alchemist who is working to protect magic-twisted former students of the Cairndale Institute.

Once the pieces are all in place, we’re set off on a wild journey filled with horror, violence, bloodshed, and dark magic. Because there are always those who will do whatever it takes to gain power, no matter who they have to use, abuse, or torture to get it. And we’re shown all of that in vivid detail from the perspective of many different characters, each of which have suffered in their own way.

We’re also given more insight into the magic—the “talents”—introduced in the first book, offered a greater understanding of how it works, what is limitations are, what the consequences and side effects may be, and the real danger that threatens all magic-users. We also get a great deal more lore and mythology of this fascinating magical world—as well as the twisted alternate realm of death—that keeps ratcheting up the stakes and creating a more epic adventure.

If *Ordinary Monsters* set the tone, *Bringer of Dust* keeps dialing it up to 11. This story goes darker, bloodier, creepier, and more emotionally devastating. The stakes are greater than ever, the struggle more impossible, and the inevitable losses so much harder to bear.

It’s a spellbinding read that will keep you turning the pages and unable to look away no matter how much you want to. Not for the faint of heart, for sure, but a story that will burn itself firmly in your mind and heart.

Underrated Gems from Small Authors ,"I've just finished reading City of Blood by Dominic Scott which is a new book from a completely unheard of author. I quite enjoyed it, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but very fun none the less.

That you really enjoyed and would recommend? ",fantasy
I  really dislike the Assassins quest (Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb). Should I read the rest of her books?,"I know I will probably piss of a lot people but I really dislike the Farseer trilogy for following reasons:

1. Through the whole series we hear Molly this and Molly that. In the end she just ends up being with Fitz father figure. They barely interact for the whole trilogy and we are supposed to buy that they are soulmates? What selfish does Fitz have to remained hidden from Molly and his daughter? Regal is not a factor anymore. Doesnt his daughter have the right to know her real father?
2. Regal is probably my least favourite antagonist of all time. Just a stereotypical good looking douchebag that has the mentality of a child with tantrums. Really? Its the most cliche villain ever.
3. Robin Hobb barely expands on the raiders and forging. We only know that they are attacking and making people into zombies, but nothing else. They are mentioned a bit in the end, but not enough.
4. The last book is way too long. For a huge portion of the book Fitz is just...walking. I think the book would have benefited from trimming out 200 pages or so. It just gets so boring after a while.
5. I hate when people are vague for no reason. I got so frustrated when Kettle was mysterious and refused to elaborate on anything. For what reason? You are with a bunch of people you are relaying on each other, and you refuse just for the sake of refusing.
6. I liked the relationship between Fitz and the wolf, but most if his communication is basically ""I am hungry, lets hunt"".
7. I like how Robin made Kettricken into a strong leader for her to just end up being this simp who just want even a crumble of Veritys love, despite how he treats her like shit for the whole series.
8. For two books we get attached to really good characters for them to become just sidenotes and replaced by less interesting characters.

Despite all of these issues, should I keep reading her work? I liked the first two books, but I really dislike the last one.",fantasy

# The Blade Itself - Joe Abercrombie

*First in a Series, Prologues and Epilogues, Multi-POV, Character with a Disability (HM), Book Club or Readalong Book*

I finally got around to reading the first book of The First Law, and I’m not sure that it’s entirely what I expected, but I’m also not complaining. The book focuses on a variety of characters finding their way in the world in their own ways, a warrior accompanying a powerful wizard, an inquisitor looking into corruption among merchants, and a nobleman training for a sword-fighting tournament. A lot of recommendations talk about how this book doesn’t have a plot, but I disagree; it really has a few plots that intersect here and there and the story is more about the society and the people than it is about the particular events themselves.

I enjoyed it overall and give it a solid recommendation. Will be back for more of the series once I'm done with my card (and my Stormlight reread) and have time to breathe.

# The Mercy of Gods - James S. A. Corey

*First in a Series, Published in 2024, Space Opera (YMMV), Survival (HM)*

I loved The Expanse, so when I saw that the duo of James S. A. Corey was starting up a new series I thought I’d check it out. I enjoyed The Expanse so much that there was no way these guys would let me down, right?

Well, the first half of the book was a total slog, and the second half was good enough that I *might* pick up the second book after all.

This is ultimately an alien invasion story, in which a group of academics get imprisoned on a spaceship and have to figure out how to survive their captivity in with a bunch of alien species they weren’t aware of when they woke up that morning. Unfortunately, the characters are pretty underdeveloped overall and I had a hard time caring about them. On the other hand, the pace at which the characters pull at the loose threads and start to understand their situation made for a compelling plot in spite of what I felt was otherwise unengaging writing.

If you’re a big fan of sci-fi, give it a shot. If you like a mystery, give it a shot. Otherwise, I think this one is pretty skippable. It is very much so not The Expanse and if you go in thinking you’ll be getting more of that then you’ll probably be disappointed.

# Warhammer 40,000: Da Big Dakka (An Ufthak Blackhawk Novel) - Mike Brooks

*Multi-POV, Published in 2024, Orcs/Trolls/Goblins (HM), Survival (YMMV)*

Going to be honest, I only initially picked this up because it was part of an Audible 2-for-1 sale while I was already playing Space Marine 2, but I’m very glad I did. It follows three main characters: an ork named Ufthak who is both trying to finally come home from raiding with something to show for his work and struggling with changes in his mental capacity that are effectively biologically turning him into “management” instead of a grunt soldier, a grot (basically a subspecies of ork that is the underling caste) who is trying to become the grot boss and maybe even lead something over a class revolution over the orks, and a Drukhari (read: dark elf) Archon who is trying to both manage the competing factions in the Drukhari city of Commorragh and hold off the ork invasion currently underway.

I was pretty surprised at the quality of the characterization and how each POV character has their own individual struggles aside from the greater invasion of Commorragh. It’s a bit jarring to read any time an ork speaks—their Cockney accents are generally written out—but that was also a boon when listening to the audiobook performance by Harry Myers; he does an excellent job of voicing all of the characters and making them sound distinct.

I didn’t expect to be blown away, but in the end I thought it was actually a great read and should be fairly accessible to those who aren’t already versed in the Warhammer 40,000 lore.

# An Absolutely Remarkable Thing - Hank Green

*First in a Series, Dreams*

This debut novel from Hank Green has the main character going on a sort of investigation/scavenger hunt when a bunch of mysterious sculptures appear in major cities around the globe. The plot is primarily driven by figuring out the next step in the puzzle and the global response to the appearance of the statues, and while it’s good and suspenseful and made me want to power through to get the next answer in the chain, the end result was underwhelming. Sure, it’s the first in a duology, but—and I can’t really explain why without giving major spoilers—the ending really didn’t feel like it was leading somewhere I’d be interested in.

The writing also has some pretty serious ADHD going on, with frequent interjections to explain previously unexplained background, changes in style from narrative prose to things like tweets and film transcriptions. It’s told very much from a first-person perspective, so it helps the characterization of the narrator, but it’s also sometimes a bit jarring.

Maybe I’ll pick up the sequel down the line, but I’m certainly in no rush to get to it and my overall feeling about this one was a resounding “... eh.”

# A Wizard of Earthsea - Ursula K. Le Guin

*First in a Series, Book Club*

This is the first novel in Le Guin’s Earthsea cycle, and while it shows its age in the writing style (rather Tolkienesque prose), it still holds up as a classic of the fantasy genre. It follows a young mage named Ged as he gets recruited to a school for wizards, accidentally releases an unknown evil because he let his ego get the better of him, and then spends the rest of the novel growing as a person and a wizard such that he may eventually capture that evil and return it from whence it came.

Aside from the broader coming-of-age themes, there’s a recurring motif here in that problems are frequently solved without physical violence. Ged solves problems instead of fireballs them, and that restraint forms an overarching message about the use of power. It’s because of that theme that I appreciated finding this in the children/YA section of my local library—it’s a great message for kids to hear—but seeing online that it also gets shelved in the adult SFF sections because it’s a theme that too many adults need to hear, too.

I don’t know if I’ll necessarily continue with the series in the long term (this was a fairly standalone plot afterall) but I’ll solidly recommend this first book.

After this it's just five more reads to go. I've got a few penciled in:

* Dark Academia: My ebook hold for this finally came in this morning after months, so I'll be taking it on vacation with me.
* Published in 2024: I happened across a copy of *A View from the Stars* (a collection of short fiction and essays by Cixin Liu) while at the library picking up Earthsea yesterday, and I enjoyed *A Remembereance of Earth's Past*, so that will be waiting for me when I get back.
* Multi-POV: Got my copy of *Wind and Truth* preordered, so I'm stuck waiting on that one. Trying to power through a Stormlight reread before then in addition to the other two titles mentioned previously. We'll see how that goes.
* Reference Materials and Judge a Book Book by it's Cover: Undecided on these. I've already read a few this year that qualify for the former, and basically anything could qualify for the latter. Saving the cover judging for last.",fantasy
"[Review] Jam Reads: Mystery of the Pale King, by Sam Flynn","https://preview.redd.it/u97myr4f6epd1.jpg?width=333&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d36d0a58656e39d51628555468f5ba2fb5a492e3

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/mystery-of-the-pale-king-by-sam-flynn)

*Mystery of the Pale King* is a grimdark meets cosmic horror novella written by Sam Flynn, and published by Timber Ghost Press. A piece that blends together eldritch horror with an interesting examination over the figure of heroes and cults, all encapsulated into a well-layered flintlock grimdark fantasy, slowly unleashing the truth over the reader while chilling their bones.

As page to the Bishop Antonius, Faron is sent together with him to Hathur, as the Church of the Sol Creator has tasked them and a small armed force to repossess those lands in the name of the Church from the hands of the Hero of Hathur, a semi-mythical figure for Faron, who grew listening about his stories. All the reputation and the inheritance of the Hero and his family have been wasted on the production of a profane play, with the Hero playing the main role. A journey that will show the horrors that are part of Hathur's past, and that will put Faron at the limit, questioning not only his devotion to the Church, but his own identity while he tries to save the Bishop from Hathur's people.

A story that slowly submerges us into a highly atmospheric setting, whose past is intimately related to cosmic horror (a bit in the style of Yharnam or *Bloodborne)*; a past that the Hero is trying to bring back. Faron, acting as our narrator, will have to be careful while trying to rescue the bishop from this place, but in the process, he will slowly understand the nature behind Hathur and the Church, putting his own identity at play.

Flynn weaves a smart examination over how the stories and the real person may differ (such as the case of the Hero), leading to even messianic conducts, while also taking a look over how organized religion can be oppressive against identity. The atmosphere is carefully crafted, slowly creating that sensation of something wrong at the start, and shocking us once we get the first glimpses of what is happening.

*Mystery of the Pale King* is an excellent novella, that shows the great potential of Sam Flynn as an author, perfect for those that are looking for an atmosphere similar to *Bloodborne.* Perfect for reading in a sit, I wonder if we would ever return to this world, as there is much potential to explore.",fantasy

"I'M J M MIRO, AUTHOR OF ORDINARY MONSTERS. THE SEQUEL, BRINGER OF DUST, IS ON SALE TODAY! AMA!","Hi all, I'm the author of the dark historical fantasy novel Ordinary Monsters (2022) and its kin, Bringer of Dust (2024), the first 2 books in The Talents Trilogy.

Set in the late nineteenth century, the Talents books tell the story of Charlie and Marlowe and Alice Quicke, of Ribs and Oskar and Komako - children from all over the world, born with unusual abilities, stalked by a sinister man of smoke. It's a story of found family, and belonging, set against a world of fog and cruelty and evil. But there's also kindness and love and friendship throughout. What makes you different, is sometimes what makes you most... you.

Both Ordinary Monsters and Bringer of Dust are, as writers tend to say with a blush, feats of typing. Big books. Big stories. Lots of characters. They didn't start out that way, but grew in the telling, which is just sometimes how it goes.

I don't surface often, but I love connecting with fellow readers and lovers of books when I do. A little about me: I was eleven years old and lonely and steeped in fantasy novels when I decided I wanted to be a writer. That never changed. Decades later, I'm a full-time writer and live on the west coast of Canada with my family, near a bear-haunted forest, with a grey ocean and grey skies and a grey rocky beach visible from my window. Most days I answer to my other name, Steven Price, under which I've published two collections of poetry, as well as three non-fantastical novels.

I'll be in and out all day, happy to answer anyone's questions as best I can. Ask me anything!

EDIT: I'm turning in now, but I just wanted to thank all of you for your excellent questions and kind words. This was fun! Good night and happy reading.",fantasy

The Traitor Son Series by Miles Cameron,"WOW! If you want a really great military fantasy in an authentic seeming medieval setting check this one out. Without giving too much away I will say that while the series begins with fairly low stakes (defending a convent against some nasty critters) by the end we get some seriously titanic clashes on multiple continents.   
This series for sure has some of the best battle scenes I've read and even better the battles themselves are won by smart use of terrain, good discipline and effective use of combined arms warfare instead of the writer having the main character pull off some clever trick (something that a lot of fantasy writers like to use)

I can't stand romantasy. I have not and will never read Sarah J Maas or Fourth Wing or anything like that. Its fine. I hope romantasy fans enjoy this one. It's probably going to be roaring success. I have more than enough books to read.

A Midnight Tides Review,"Do Not Read this if you haven’t read midnight todes by Steven Erikson!!!!!


A Midnight Tides Review-

Plot: To begin, I think that’s this plot is perhaps the most straightforward we’ve seen from the series so far and that’s a good thing. As much as I enjoy the other books, yes even you House of Chains, the plots are often convoluted to follow at times, Midnight Tides however does not suffer from that problem and thus makes the book much easier to read than it’s predecessors. The plot as I understand is essentially about two diametrically opposed people going to war with one another. One is or was steeped in its traditions of a bygone era while the other was a supposed haven for the forward thinking, and freedom oriented beliefs. Of course both are a facade for a decaying and broken society but I won’t go into that here. Essentially the group that believes itself to be the dominant empire, the Lethrii get bent over the sink by the much more traditional Tiste Edur led by a unkillable Emperor who is the puppet for the crippled god doesn’t get much simpler than that when it comes to overarching plots in Malazan and honestly it just works super well. This is probably my favorite overall plot besides Memories of Ice. 

Worldbuilding:I think the worldbuilding here in midnight tides is probably the closest I’ve come to feeling like I’m stepping into a living breathing world. I tend to think that Erikson jumps around from place to place a little too much for me to really connect with the environment and what’s going on in the day to day but here? Not an issue. The Edur and the Letherii are both very interesting groups to follow with their own culture backgrounds and biases towards each other. I found the exploration and thematic representation of both to be very well done.

Characters: Midnight Tides to the suprise of literally no one who has read Malazan has great characters, so great in fact that I dare say these are some of my favorites outside of our bridge burning friends. There’s so many great characters to talk about but the main ones I want to focus on are essentially the three Edur brothers. First let us begin with the Sengar brothers because they are slightly easier to begin with. Trull, Fear and Rhulad are all very interesting characters to follow because they each have their own unique internal structure and dynamics that make for an interesting contrast to one another. Fear is this “silent leader” who the Edur follow not because he is a Simone who struts around and talks well but rather because his actions speak for him. What’s interesting about Fear however is that compared to his brothers, Trull especially, he is so willing to go with the change that is forced upon his people despite his internal strife and ultimately this leads him to losing everything. Rhulad on the other hand is perhaps a near opposite to Fear, he’s this cocky shit who wants what his brothers have and it is ultimately in this pursuit of power and glory that leads him down the road of insanity and suffering. Honestly his entire arc his heartbreaking to watch even though I kinda hate him for being by such a piece of garbage. Then there’s Trull and man what a characte. Trull is neither a cocky ass nor is he this well loved and silent type like his brothers, in fact Trull is a man or Edur unto himself. What I mean by this is Trull is deeply introspective and is also trying to figure out how what and why things are happening. He’s not afraid to ask the hard questions or go against the grain, yet at the same time he’s also a Edur filled with compassion, especially towards Rhulad who he understands is a threat and yet wants to help him anyways. All three are just fascinating and I could probably go on and on and even talk about how the Beddict brothers are an interesting contrast and dead to the Sengar brothers but I’ll save that for perhaps another day.

Dialogue/comedy: the dialogue in Midnight Tides is in my opinion some of the best in the series thus far. There is a lot of commentary done by Erikson where he is essentially discussing his own philosophical and political ideas and insights and yet it’s absolutely brilliant. I mean Tehol Beddict goes on what I would call a leftist critique of the capitalist system and yet it never comes off as preachy or anything of the sort. Instead I find that unlike so many other modern fantasy authors, Erikson delivers his own opinions of biases in a way that is completely relevant to the actual story itself and is on line with these characters actions.

There is of course other dialogue as well but if you’ve read Malazan you will know by now that Erikson is great at writing conversations about almost anything, or even nothing at all. I believe that Tehol and Bugg are the embodiment of this pint because these two are both brilliant together and separate from each other. They are hilarious but in a way that is sincere and meaningful, honestly if you want to know how to write character dialogue just read this book.



Action:What do I even need to say when it comes to Malazan action? Probably nothing because if you’re reading this you already know it’s great, but I’ll talk anyways.

The action in midnight tides is much as you would expect from this series and that’s by no means a critique. The action in Malazan is frankly from the best in the genre overall that I’ve read. Between the creativity and visceral nature of the violence which is often on display during a battle/ magic showdown / sword fight I’m never disappointed by Erikson’s ability to write action. The man always is willing to go there with the most insane shit you’ve ever read and then he will always crank it to an 11. The dude had the balls to write a scene with a crippled wizard king using the son and wife of Lethrii king as a conduit for power during a mage fight. I mean that’s metal as shit so idk what else to say, the action is always good and serves a purpose. 

Overall thoughts:

Overall I find Midnight Tides to be a big step up from House of Chains which I didn’t really enjoy as much. After the first act, which I admit was a little slow, I think this book just fires on all cylinders when it comes to what I expect from the series at this point. It has the great characters, it has the the great dialogue, I think the plot is really tight and well executed especially considering how self contained it is in comparison to the other books so far. So yeah this is a good book, still not my favorite as I enjoy the first three in the series more but i also enjoyed my time with this one as well. Trull and Tehol are probably the two most interesting characters we’ve been introduced to and amoung my favorites now, especially Trull I really liked this one and look forward to more. 8.5/10

My ranking so far-

1. Memories of Ice 9.7/10
2. Deadhouse Gates 9.2/10
3. Gardens of the Moon 8.8/10
4. Midnight Tides 8.5/10
5. House of Chains 8/10

The fact that Guy Gavriel Kay published three of the best fantasy novels ever written back-to-back-to-back is crazy to me and should be talked about more,"*The Lions of Al-Rasan* in 1995, *Sailing to Sarantium* in 1998 and *Lord of Emperors* in 2000 is such an insane back-to-back-to-back publishing streak that it leaves me dumbfounded that it isn't spoken about more.

Review - Scion of Storms by Samuel Hinton 4/5,"https://beforewegoblog.com/audiobook-review-scion-of-storms-by-samuel-hinton/

SCION OF STORMS by Samuel Hinton is the second of the Manifestations book series. Manifestations is a cultivation book, which is a type of fantasy that is about accumulating power through an Eastern-style magic system. Manifestations is no more Eastern than Avatar: The Last Airbender but has strong influences from it that set it apart from typical Western Medieval fantasy. I really enjoyed the first book, SOUL RELIC, and picked up the second audiobook as soon as I was finished.

The premise is that village girl, Raysha, has just enrolled in the Academy now that she’s managed to overcome her issue of being unable to regenerate aeon. Ironically, no sooner than she arrives, Raysha ditches all of her classes before focusing on the chance to win the school tournament. This has the opportunity of bestowing cash as well as physical prizes that could be the difference between poverty or great wealth.

There’s a lot of humor to be had in this story as Raysha is mono-focused on the competition to the point that she has no interest in the Academy whatsover. As an academic, I understand this attitude even as I find it deeply frustrating. Raysha would rather self-study or try to pry secrets out of her brother than try to get information from anyone who claims to be an authority figure.

Raysha is quite entertaining with the chip she’s carrying on her shoulder from her time in the village being condescended to. She instinctively hates the rich, nobility, and anyone who is above her. This actually gets her into trouble as she drives away both allies and creates enemies. It also leads her to ignore the fact the primary purpose of the tournament is to get the patronage of the noble houses that she despises on general principle.

There’s a lot of Harry Potter energy in this story but less of the whimsy. Raysha has to eat humble pie several times as while she has a lot of power to throw around, she doesn’t have nearly the experience or knowledge to wield it. Raysha learns to soften some of her views but hardens others and seeing which way she falls is always entertaining.

If you like magical combat, tournament arcs, and snarky heroines then this is definitely the book for you. Raysha can be annoying to anyone who thinks the rich might not automatically be scum and you might want to actually take advantage of classes if you’re attending a university but these are depicted as flaws she needs to overcome.

“The Iron Throne” as a conceit in mid 90s fantasy?,"This is a serious post.

In November 1995, a book titled The Iron Throne, based on the Birthright setting of D&amp;D was released.

In January 1996, work began on the game would be called Baldur’s Gate. The initial title for the game was The Iron Throne, until members of the developer’s publisher insisted it be changed. In fact even in the final game, The Iron Throne is a faction that represents the biggest antagonist of the game. 

In August 1996, A Game of Thrones was published, by then relatively not famous author George RR Martin, centering on the game played amongst nobles, ladies, and lords who would become King or Queen and sit on The Iron Throne.

Best authors for characterization in fantasy? ,"I've been a fan of fantasy novels since the 1980's, but it has recently struck me that many of the works that I have loved, as well as many of those which are incredibly popular but about which I hold heretical views, aren't necessarily great examples of particularly strong characterization. 

Which authors do you feel truly nail great characterization in the fantasy genre? In particular, those who don't seem to require thousands of pages across a series to make a character especially memorable or well-rounded deserve a bonus, in my opinion. 

Thank you for your thoughts. ",fantasy
Arcane Ascension 5: When Wizards Follow Fools Spoiler Free Review,"Hello! Having just finished up book 5, I wanted to go ahead and review it. 

First and foremost, I won't lie, I was wary entering this book. Arcane Ascension is well written, but it's got two big problems: 

The first is that it has a major number of mysteries to the point I actually started to lose track of what some of those mysteries are. I loved Edge of the Woods' vibe, but it didn't really help on that front, just adding more mysteries onto the pile of existing mysteries and strangeness. It was getting to be a lot for me. 

The second is that Corin is ridiculously underpowered. He's a progression fantasy main character who's capable of making revolutionary magic items, and yet is frequently one of the weakest members of any given fight. He's fighting big fights, but sometimes his very survival strains belief.

I won't claim that AA5 mysteriously solved every problem that the series was facing, because that would be a lie. 

What I will say is that it felt like a breath of fresh air. 

Multiple mysteries were progressed, or even somewhat resolved. There were new ones exposed, but it didn't feel like every half an answer gave three more mysteries, and I think we're moving towards having some real answers now. I can't say what all of them are, of course, as that would rather defeat the point of a spoiler free review, but there are some major hints, and a lot of smaller answers, given. 

When it comes to power ups, this book has a lot of smaller powerups, things that it felt like Corin desperately needed, and he's moving into a territory that's somewhat reasonable for him to be involved with all of the crazy events he's caught up in without instantly dying. Furthermore, it seems like there's going to be more powerups soon to follow, given certain bargains struck, and I'm excited to see how those manifest!

All in all, for those who were unsatisfied with AA 3 and 4, I think that this book will give you a chance to re-ignite some of the passion you had in 1 and 2. It's worth a read. ",fantasy

Does anyone else struggle with reading action / battle / fighting scenes?,"Hi! I wanted to start a discussion about something I’ve noticed about myself for a long time: I really struggle with reading action, battle, or fighting scenes in books.

I’ll admit, I tend to shy away from this type of media in general—whether it’s in movies, TV shows, or books. I’m much more drawn to character-driven stories rather than plot-driven ones. This has always been the case for me, but recently, it’s been bothering me more and I've been investigating how I can possible either (1) make peace with this, or (2) overcome it.

Not all action scenes are created equal. Some span just a part of a chapter, and while I might not be particularly into them, I can still get through it. But in other cases—especially in fantasy novels—I find myself slogging through entire chapters (sometimes several!) of non-stop fighting, warfare, or battles. And honestly, it takes everything in me just to push through.

Let me try to explain why I struggle with these scenes.

For the longest time, I thought the problem was that I just couldn’t visualize the actions. I’ll read a paragraph about someone stabbing someone with a sword or a tower being destroyed by cannonballs, and I’ll have to re-read it because I’m not sure what just happened. Maybe it's because a simplistic action (like a tower breaking down from being hit) is being broken down into 25 smaller actions that are rough to follow. The whole thing feels disorienting and breaks my immersion from the story.

More recently however, I’ve started to think it’s not just about my inability to picture the scenes. I think it’s the nature of action scenes themselves. They’re often fully external—just a sequence of, “this happens, then this happens, and then this.” The violence and urgency are meant to create excitement, but for me, it ends up feeling repetitive. You could simplify it to “The soldiers attacked the tower,” (which would be boring and not very literary) or, a more extreme example might be, you could spend five chapters detailing every move the soldiers make and how the defenders react. Both options leave me feeling disconnected.

I will admit this: I’m relatively new to the fantasy and sci-fi genres. I’ve always been put off by the idea of reading long, drawn-out sequences of “this person does this, then this other person reacts by doing that.” I really wish I didn’t feel this way! I know a lot of people get a thrill out of these scenes (or so I assume!).

This leaves me feeling conflicted because I’m so drawn to certain elements of fantasy and sci-fi—like the aesthetics, settings, and intricate worldbuilding. I just don’t know if I can push through the action-heavy parts.

For some more concrete examples, I’ve enjoyed *The Locked Tomb* series, one of my first dips into sci-fi/fantasy, because while it does have action scenes, they don’t go on for too long so I could overlook it. On the other hand, I just finished *Uprooted* by Naomi Novik, and while I absolutely ADORE the setting and concept (haunted woods? yes, please!), the last part of the book was almost entirely a never-ending action scene that felt like a slog.

I’ve heard great things about authors like Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson, but I worry their books might have similarly overwhelming action sequences.

So, here’s what I’m wondering:

* Does anyone else have a tough time reading action or battle scenes?
* If so, have you found a way to make peace with them, or do you just avoid them altogether?
* Do you steer clear of fantasy and sci-fi because of this? Or have you found examples of these genres that manage to avoid action-heavy sections?
* Are there types of action scenes that don’t feel so overwhelming to you?

I would also be really interested to know if there is a good way to find or seek out fantasy/sci-fi that avoids these types of scenes, or at least only has them in small quantities?

I’d love to hear your thoughts!",fantasy

How much does the average paperback costs these days where you live?,"I've seen a few posts around here talking about how much the prices of books have surged and that paperbacks cost $15 dollars in some places which sounds absolutely terrifying to me.

I mostly read modern fantasy books  and I find more popular books being a bit cheaper (Colleen Hoover, Chetan Bhagat etc.) and with classics being even cheaper (Dovtoetsky, Wilde, Stoker). Of course, I order all my stuff from Amazon and buying from a physical books store costs like two to three hundred rupees more.

I occasionally get hardcovers, the price of which varies a lot more, usually ranging from fifteen to twenty five dollars but I have paid up to fourty for a self-published book (Dreams Of The Dying) and the American version of The Way Of Kings.

Books with ACTUAL couple chemistry?,"I’m in desperate need of some book recs with a couple that has great chemistry and banter. I've lost count of the number of books where the characters just feel super bland, the 'love' super forced and unbelivable and I’m soo over it.

Ideally, I’d love some fantasy where the romance isn’t the main focus, rather a tasty addition where you can still feel the connection between the couple. I’m NOT looking for the typical cookie-cutter possessive enemies-to-lovers shadow-powers winged daddy trope, because let’s be real, it’s badly written and not what I’m after.

I just want a story with realistic, fun characters where the romance is more in the background but still makes you smile and you can feel actual familiarity.

I recently finished Six of Crows (against my will as my teen sister won't shut up about it) and it was just as I expected it to be - an entire books-worth of characters, all madly in love with someone from their team, all of them unable to express themselves and all of them sooo unnecessary over-the-top edgy. Yes, I know it's YA and it's bad by definition (not bashing on the author, I actually like his writting style).

How do you feel about author's inserting their personal religious beliefs into their work?,"I'm not sure if it's my own bias as a non-religious person, but I often feel that some of the stories I watch/read are cheapened when I suspect the author is pushing their religious views into their writing too strongly. 

A few examples: The Sun Eater series and, possibly more controversially, The Lord of the Rings. 

I love the Sun Eater series, but the latest book pushed some strong religious influences that I wasn't a fan of. &gt;!Main character starts as a non-religious, skeptical guy, but essentially transitions to a Jesus-like character after being revived (more than once) and given certain powers by what is basically the Christian god (although he for some reason believes it to be some other god). He then begins to start praying regularly, which was just weird for his character, and defending why his god doesn't just end the war with the evil Cielcin because ""then there would be no free will!""!&lt;

In The Lord of the Rings, I haven't gotten around to the books yet, but in the movies I was never really a fan of how Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White. After reading some lore, I was disappointed to learn that it basically summed up to ""God just brought him back"". 

It feels like more than being influenced by the author's faith, these story elements just make for bad storytelling. You have a protagonist force that wants the good guys to win, and has the power to just make it happen, but doesn't because ""then there's be no free will"", seems to be the common argument.

Book Review: The Traitors We Are by Michael Roberti ,"**TL;DR Review –** “Light” grimdark flavor, with singular characters and a world that just keeps getting more interesting with every chapter.

https://preview.redd.it/lawmv3hzq6pd1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457782c741d641ff5b9200bb10fae9e45088c4ff



# Full Review:

I was utterly unprepared for what I was getting myself into when I first cracked open *The Traitors We Are.*

Right in the beginning, we’re thrust into a big, bloody battle (my favorite!) and get a juicy dose of both action and worldbuilding from the jump. But we’re also introduced to some of our main players and some very cool aspects of the world. Over the course of the story, all of that keeps getting dialed up—until by the end, I was *very much* a fan of this fascinating fantasy world.

**The World:**

The world is familiar in many ways: the Reach (thing Scotland/Ireland) is fighting for its independence against the Keeps (England), only in this story, the Keeps are forced to consider making peace and giving the Reach what they want because the Reach’s chieftain, Ordan, keeps winning battles.

We’re given a look at the Scottish highlands-feeling world of the Reach, with its small towns, humble people, and tight-knit families. Then we’re whisked away to the very London-meets-King’s-Landing capital city, home to all the power players who want to take advantage of this new balance to, inevitably, gain more power.

There are also some very fascinating and unique elements, though. Chief among them is the way that writing disappears after someone dies. People keep letters or signatures written by their loved ones, and check them after every battle to see whether those people are alive. There are times I wish this was used to more dramatic effect—a critical piece of information isn’t given to the hero because the one who wrote it was killed—but instead it’s used in a fascinatingly callous, almost off-handed way that serves to underscore the grimdark flavor of the story.

The characters also have to “speak ill of the dead” to avoid angering the gods, so every funeral is filled with insults and disrespect—the crueler and harsher, the more it demonstrates the person’s love and respect for the fallen. A fascinating twist on the usual funeral/reverence for the dead flavors.

There’s a lot about the world outside the Reach and Keeps that isn’t explained, but overall, you know more than enough to stay grounded in the action and follow along with the characters’ journeys.

**Characters:**

There are a lot of POV characters throughout—sometimes they’re used as a “throwaway” to introduce some twist or reveal, to flesh out the world in interesting ways, or to give insight into some of the darker, twistier characters.

However, the main POV characters are:

**Cael Oberlan.** Fighter, hot-head, and general asshole, he’s always angry and spoiling for a fight with anyone over anything. He also has an immense amount of agency—he will do *anything* without considering the consequences until after it’s done, and that “wild card” flavor makes him a character you absolutely want to follow along to see what he’s going to do and how he’s going to make everything worse. Yet he’s also a surprisingly decent man (somewhere WAYYYYY down deep) in his own way.

**Emil Trestinsen.** War hero, slayer of Lorcan Oberlan (Cael’s brother), and spoiled nobleman, he’s an absolute naif when it comes to the world in which he lives. He thinks everything is glory and heroics, spectacular duels and celebratory parades. He trips his way through the world untouched by reality, but also unmarred by it. He is genuinely “good” and wants to try to make things better—he just goes about it with the innocence of a sheltered child in the body of a sword-wielding man. His story is a spectacular exercise in irony.

**Merily Oberlan.** Daughter to the conquering Reach chief, sister to Cael, and, unfortunately, prize to be offered off in marriage to whoever suits her father’s whims. She doesn’t start off with a great deal of agency, but she slowly develops into one of the strongest, most compelling characters in the story. Her pairing with (WON’T SPOIL IT FOR YOU!) makes for a fascinating dynamic, and promises interesting dramatic developments down the road.

**Erik Tremmin.** Knight of the Evertree, a soldier to the core, he carries around the scars and disabilities resulting from his loss in battle to Cael. Curiously, though, he and Cael both have a “that was war” mentality, so though they both had good cause to want the other dead in battle, they forge an interesting…well, friendship isn’t the right word quite yet, perhaps better said a mutual respect and grudging understanding.  

Each of these characters feels utterly unique from the others, and in many ways, they’re standouts in the fantasy genre. They make for very compelling reading and anchor the story so well they keep you coming back to find out what’s going to happen next.

**The Tone:**

*The Traitors We Are* definitely falls into the grimdark genre tonally. There’s an utter disregard for human life, an almost casual acceptance of death and suffering, the mocking of the dead, the almost “breeziness” to the battles (people just die and no big deal is made of it), and the overall story progression skews toward the dark.

But it’s not PITCH BLACK like some other grimdark books I’ve read. Instead, it’s more “grimdark light”, where there are happy moments that are only slightly marred by the grim to come, and the grimness never goes quite as deep or dark as it could.

**Wrapping Up:**

*The Traitors We Are* proves a truly entertaining, compelling, and complex read, with some of the most unique characters I’ve encountered in grimdark—or in the fantasy genre at large. Highly, highly recommended!",fantasy

Stormlight Archive: What Are Your Thoughts on the Apparent Structure of Book 5? (Full Stormlight Spoilers),"From the preview chapters we've seen, it appears that the contest of champions will be the climax of Stormlight 5. That means 1000+ pages of waiting. The structure seems to be 1 day = 1 part or something similar.

I've always had an issue with the length of the books (unpopular opinion, I know, and it's cool if you disagree), and the direction the released chapters are going in make it seem like the book will go in circles for at least 700 pages before we get to what we've all been waiting for. If this is the case I'm not sure I'll enjoy the book nearly as much as I expect to.

Does anyone share my concerns? Or does everyone think these concerns don't make sense (perhaps because there's much more to the books than the contest)? I'm interested to hear all of your opinions (please be nice, I will be too!)

"The Blackest Heart by Brian Lee Durfee - it got better, but it got worse [Review]","It's the review for the second book in The Five Warrior Angels trilogy by Brian Lee Durfee, so if you're interested, there is a review of first book (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1f5nq9e/the\_forgetting\_moon\_by\_brian\_lee\_durfee\_not\_ideal/), it makes sense to read it if you're interested in series, cause this particular book has the same issues as previous one and i don't wanna repeat myself much. It's spoiler free review, but there are hidden spoilers for those, who read the book.

So.

**Writing** was overdescriptive and it's still overdecsriptive. That's all about that. Be ready to push yourself through a lot of text, but if you've read the first book you already know it.

**The story** became better in this book, cause it started to roll, characters started to do some actions, their paths started to cross, they started to interact with each other and i found this book much easier and engaging to read and follow, because now you're really interested in what will happen next, while in the first book i was almost sleeping at some POVs. But in terms of huge twists book has the same problem - everything is pretty predictable. I mean, there are some unexpected moments, but big story twists are easy to guess, cause author spoils the stuff earlier than it's needed or makes so obvious foreshadowing, that it also spoils the twists. I haven't read the third book, so i may be wrong, but now it looks this way.

**Characters**... Well, it's not so clear. I mentioned in previous review that some characters like Gault were used as eyes to look upon some group of other characters and most of their chapters were filled with other characters, rather than their own thoughts and emotions. Well, Gault got his chapters right now, but other characters lost it. Like, for example, Nail, who was imo the best POV in previous book, became mostly as i said an eye to look upon the Fellowship of the Nine. We've got so few of his own thoughts. And the situation became worse, cause another character from the same group also became POV to show the same group. And decision to make him POV is still weird for me, cause he's got pretty confusing character arc:&gt;!he lost his family and village -&gt; he lost his beloved -&gt; he missed her -&gt; he died!&lt;. Jondralyn after the ending of first book become less cocky and delusional, but she still helpless and she didn't changed much. At least, she's not so irritating as before. Ava Shay still just a damsel in distress. Lindholf, surprisingly, become very interesting for me and exciting to follow.

But there is a thing i want to tell about the characters like Jovan, Leif and Glade. They supposed to be bad guys. I've got it. They selfish, stupid, sexist (like very much sexist), cruel and disgusting. But i can't hate them. And not because i'm endorse they behavior, but because they were made so grotesquely bad, that i just can't believe in them. Do you remember Joffrey from ASOIAF? Did you hate that little spoiled bitch? As am i. Because despite all shit he have done, he was believable, but bad characters here were made just illogically bad. They were bad written. This problem was present in previous book, but here it much more deeper.

And, finally, **my personal pain**. It's an epic fantasy, old-school and tropy, 'heavy metal' fantasy as it was promoted, so i was expecting a lot of epic stuff, but unfortunately, it did not happen. All event are mostly local-level, no epic stuff at all, until the end of the second book. I mean, it's story about the future Apocalypse (not a spoiler, talks about Fiery Absolution began right from the start) and war preceding it, but we've got no battles expect the conquering of Gallows Haven, which was more a slaughter, than a battle.

And then, we've got battle at Lord's Point. 200k army vs 50-66k army. Huge, epic... And disgracefully stupid. Well, i'm not the kind of a guy who demands from every fantasy to be 100% historically accurate and realistic, i'm always trying to figure out the level of realism while i'm reading some book and adjust my expectations to it. From the very first book, i've understood that realism level here is somewhere near 'anime-level' and i've accepted the rules, it was fine for me. Until this level dropped down at this battle. It was the most disappointing moment in this series i've read and one of the worst fantasy battles i've read. There are some explanations for those who read the book.

So, the reasons why i hate this battle:

1. &gt;!200k army landed at the beach like momentarily. So, they just sailed and \*clap\* they're at the coast already, ready for the battle. It really takes a tremendous fleet to transport such huge army and it will take at least DAYS to land these mass of people and horses (yes, it was mentioned that significant part of this army was ahorsed), maybe even WEEKS, but not in an instant.!&lt;
2. &gt;!They were stupid enough to land right before the tide. How did they conquered the biggest part of the world i wonder?!&lt;
3. &gt;!Right after the start of battle armies were mixed with each other. No formations, no tactics, just hollywood-level battle where all fighting individual fights and letting heroes to duel each other, while others just dont touch them. In fact such things were rare in history and meant a lose for both armies because nobody controls nothing in these cases. Again, i'm not demanding 100% historically accurate battle, but this one didn't feel a proper battle at all.!&lt;
4. &gt;!When the tide reached some high level, when all fighters had water at their waists and chests, sharks and merfolks arrived and started to kill everyone. Well, i don't know about merfolk, but i can't imagine sharks would come to the shoal where A QUARTER OF MILLION people fighting. Predators are not so brainless and more than that, they appeared just in the middle of the battle, teleported there maybe idk and started to bite full-armored knights in half. Should i explain how wrong it is? I understand that author wanted to show something epic and crazy, but defying common sense isn't the best approach.!&lt;
5. &gt;!Two village kids and a dog have beaten and nearly killed enemie's commander, who had 10 years of combat experience and wasn't ever wounded in battle. But, in comparison with everything else it looks like a small joke.!&lt;
6. &gt;!Both armies died in that battle, except the important characters from both sided who got the very convenient boats, appeared in very convenient places at very convenient time. I feel sorry for knights died from the sharks teeth, because it they had such plot armor, they could survive it too.!&lt;

So, i understand what author was tending to show us, but he had 0 awareness of how medieval-like battle works. Again, i'm not demanding something 100% realistic, i'm not demanding from author to study the art of war history for years before write such things, but it wouldn't take much time to watch few videos on Youtube about some historic battle to at least understand how it looks like. The problem was that the whole battle was just an epic background for characters to shine and wasn't even a battle. And this is after telling how cool and experience Sor Sevier army is. If you're writing a book with some level of realism - it could be high or low, there are different styles and genres, no matter - be consistent with it. Because if you'll changed it significantly in some moment, it will be very confusing and weird.

In **conclusion** i can say that i was mostly disappointed with this book. Previous one had some flaws which i described in my review, but it was a debut and it was promising in many ways and i don't like the numeric scoring, but to deliver my thoughts i would say the The Forgetting Moon imo had like not-very-solid-at-the-edge-of-3 4 score out of 5, but this book, despite being better in some ways, did not fixed many problems of preceding part and even worsened some of them. I wouldn't say it's bad, it's not true, it was engaging enough to finish it, but now it's 3/5 and not more. Not bad, but definitely not a good book.",fantasy

A Reflection on Trusting My Own Taste in Fiction,"I was reflecting on how ironic life can be. I still remember how, as a teenager, I was deeply in love with anime, especially the shonen genre. But one day, some people said to me, 'You like Naruto and One Piece? That’s trash. You won’t know quality until you read The Witcher like we do.' As an adult, I eventually stopped watching anime. Don’t get me wrong—it was partly because I grew a bit tired of seeing the same tropes over and over, and partly because, with my ADHD, audiovisual media isn’t the best fit for me. I tend to get lost easily if I can't move at my own pace. So, in truth, switching to books was a great decision, even if not for the right reasons.

I gave The Witcher a try as an adult, and it turned out to be perfect. I fell in love with its characters in a way I never had before, and that’s when I realized that reading was truly my thing. From there, I began exploring adult fantasy—though not too much, since I tend to pick long series, and I’ve been reading for less than ten years.

The thing is, even now, with Stormlight Archive being my favorite fiction ever, I see people writing that Brandon Sanderson’s work is just like McDonald’s—focused on quantity and speed rather than quality. They say that Realm of the Elderlings is the ‘real’ literature. And that’s when I realized the truth: I shouldn’t listen to anyone else. I should just enjoy what I already like and hold off on forming an opinion about a series until I’ve experienced it myself.

Well, I just wanted to share how foolish I was.

What are books that do interesting things with fantasy races?,"You can define ""interesting"" however you want. 

However, my specific interest is in inter-racial relations where each race isn't a single monolithic bloc with similar needs, but rather a constellation of actors with often-aligned interests. To use a real-world metaphor, the Byzantine Empire* was usually antagonistic towards the Islamic powers to its South and East, but also found use in co-opting some elements (such as Turkic nomads) into its armies, and sometimes adopted Islamic statelets as clients to later be integrated into the imperial system. Likewise, the ""Latins"" were sometimes friends, sometimes enemies, sometimes in favor in the court of a specific emperor, sometimes used as scapegoats. Rather than being some inherent ""civilizational"" affinity/antagonism, their relations were based on the interests of the state and often specific actors within the state, at a given time.

Is Red Rising becoming overrated?,"For those curious, I can confirm that I’ve read all six books in the Red Rising series, and they are indeed excellent. Pierce Brown is one of the most talented young authors, and I consider myself a fan of his for life. However, I’ve recently observed that the series has garnered significant attention and hype on platforms like TikTok.

Some rather extreme claims have surfaced, with people asserting that it is the best series of the last decade or so, and that Darrow is the greatest protagonist in modern media.

While I thoroughly enjoyed the books, I’m not sure I would go so far as to make such sweeping declarations.

With that in mind, I’d like to ask: do you think Red Rising is overrated?",fantasy

Uncomfortable parallels in Stormlight worldbuilding:,"I have always been uncomfortable with the connotations of Stormlight magic system where being worthy of a spren bond makes a person lighteyes, but recently I discovered even more disturbing context.

Like Mormon religion literally teaches that righteous people of color will become white after they are saved. In this context the whole lighteyes thing seems *extremely* weird.

What are the best works of fiction about ethical telepaths?,"
So in general, I’m looking for psychic stories about Telepaths that have ethics on how to use their powers and how not to use them.

Here are just some examples of ethics that they should follow:

1. They read the minds of their opponents to gain an advantage, but they don’t read the minds of allies or strangers without their consent.
2. They don’t alter the minds of other beings without their consent unless it is a last resort situation like they are trying to avoid bloodshed or said being is going through a mental breakdown and they use their powers to calm them down.
3. They avoid using their powers to take advantage over more vulnerable individuals (Ex: Emma Frost/Cyclops ""affair"").

So, does anyone know of any stories about Telepaths with ethics? So far the only one I'm familiar with is Psychonauts 2.",fantasy
Question for reading The Wheel Of Time,"I think I want to finally start this by the end of the year.

Reviewing reading order, I’m reminded that New Spring came out between Crossroads Of Twilight and Knife Of Dreams.

The Prince of Nothing Book 1: The Darkness That Comes Before by R. Scott Bakker Review,"Hello, my fellow journeymen! I’m excited to share another review with you all, this time for a book that has been one of my most anticipated reads in recent years. Like many of you, I regularly lurk on this subreddit, checking out recommendations and watching BookTuber reviews to find what I should add to my ever-growing TBR pile. Of course, I’ll never read everything on that list, and the knowledge of that has nearly driven me mad! But that’s neither here nor there—what matters is that I’ve finally gotten around to reading The Prince of Nothing series, specifically the first trilogy, which was gifted to me.

I’ve heard over and over that this series is as dark as fantasy gets—beautifully written, filled with philosophical moments, and offering compelling discussions about religion. Still, I don’t think any review I read or watched fully prepared me for the journey I’ve just finished. So, without further ado, let’s dive into it! As always, no major spoilers ahead, and for those who prefer it, there’s a TL;DR at the end that summarizes everything. Let’s start with the summary:

&gt;It’s a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anasûrimbor Kellhus—part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence—from lands long thought dead. The Darkness That Comes Before is a history of this great Holy War, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.

**Overview of the Plot and Setting:** *The thoughts of all men arise from the darkness. If you are the movement of your soul, and the cause of that movement precedes you, then how could you ever call your thoughts your own? How could you be anything other than a slave to the darkness that comes before?*

If you’ve never read the series but were thinking about it and you’re like me, you’ve probably read the summary and thought it doesn’t give you much about the plot. You learn that the world is scarred by a destructive past, a crusade is gathering, and there’s a guy named Kellhus from a forgotten land. Honestly, I can’t fully delve into the plot because it’s something you have to experience. Bakker just drops you into the world and expects you to run, much like how Gardens of the Moon throws you into Malazan. The Darkness That Comes Before does the same, placing you in the shoes of multiple characters at the beginning of a holy war.

What I can tell you is that the story takes place in the world of Eärwa, a place shaped by a cataclysmic event called the First Apocalypse, which happened two thousand years ago and left lasting scars. Empires have risen and fallen since, and now we follow characters like Drusas Achamian, a sorcerer; Cnaiur, a barbarian; and Esmenet, a prostitute, as a Holy War gathers to retake lost lands.

The way Bakker immerses you in this world is not for the faint of heart. Long, complicated names, a vast and intricate history—he expects you to either keep up or get left behind. Even summarizing the setting is a challenge because of its complexity, filled with so many factions and layers that it could make this review absurdly long. But that’s also the appeal. While reading, I felt I had to grasp at what was happening and work through the layers, which made the journey all the more engaging.

Now, don’t mistake this for something that’s frustrating in a bad way. The mysteries, subtle hints, and dialogue are what hooked me. I wanted to keep pushing through to uncover more, much like what I enjoyed with *Gardens of the Moon*. If you’re a fan of minimalist storytelling like what you find in FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, Sekiro, or Elden Ring, this will likely appeal to you as well. The way Bakker writes is evocative and atmospheric. I couldn’t put it down and am already eager to continue the series. But by this point, you’re probably thinking, “I still don’t know anything about the plot or setting.” Fair enough—here’s a taste of what you’re in for, without spoiling anything major. A figure known as Maithanet, a Shriah (essentially a Pope), calls for a Holy War. His identity is shrouded in mystery, and he wields considerable power. The announcement brings many players who seek to use the war for their own political ambitions, and the plot unfolds from there.

**Characters and World-Building:** *If we’re nothing more than our thoughts and passions, and if our thoughts and passions are nothing more than movements of our souls, then we are nothing more than those who move us.*

To give you a better sense of the story, I’ll introduce the main characters: Drusas Achamian, Cnaiur, Esmenet, Kellhus, and Xerius III, along with some notable minor characters like Serwë, Proyas, and Ikurei Conphas. The cast is large, but I’ll focus on the ones I found most compelling:

* Drusas Achamian: A sorcerer and spy, Achamian quickly became one of my favorite POV characters. Sorcerers are reviled in this world, seen as abominations, and Achamian belongs to the Mandate, a controversial school of sorcery. Mandate members are cursed to relive the dreams of their founder, Seswatha, who witnessed the First Apocalypse. Achamian is tasked with uncovering Maithanet’s identity and the target of the Holy War. In a typical fantasy, Achamian would be the wise old wizard, but here, he’s a broken man trying to survive and prevent another apocalypse.
* Cnaiur: A barbarian from the Scylvendi, Cnaiur would typically be portrayed as a simple brute. However, he is far more complex—cunning, filled with self-hatred, and burdened by the weight of how others perceive him. His relationship with Kellhus’ father, Anasûrimbor Moënghus, is shrouded in mystery, and his struggles with his sexuality add a deeply human layer to his character. That isn't to say he's redeemable because I don't think he is but his own self-loathing about who he truly is makes him interesting. Maybe the counselor in me is reading too much into it but still.
* Esmenet: Esmenet, a prostitute and lover of Achamian, has one of the most heartbreaking arcs. As she grows older, she is painfully aware that her time as a prostitute is limited. Her trauma, abandonment issues, and the loss of her daughter define much of her journey. She follows Achamian into the Holy War, and though her story is tragic, it’s also filled with moments of strength and resolve.
* Kellhus: The titular Anasûrimbor Kellhus is a Dûnyain monk and the son of Moënghus. He draws strong parallels to Jesus Christ—coming from a forgotten land and wielding strange powers that allow him to read people’s thoughts and manipulate them. He’s a fascinating character, and his arrival in the story shakes everything up.

The world of Eärwa is as complex as the characters who inhabit it. It’s immersive, filled with real history, and rich with philosophical and religious undertones. Bakker clearly drew inspiration from the Crusades, Christianity, Islam, and real-world cultures like Hellenistic Greece and the Byzantine Empire. The religions in the story are some of the best parts for me. I’m a sucker for well-developed faith systems in fantasy, and Bakker doesn’t disappoint here.

**The Prose and the Darkness:** *Some events mark us so deeply that they find more force of presence in their aftermath than in their occurrence.*

This book is exquisite. Let me say, I don’t always focus on prose when reading, unless it’s either really bad or really good—and Bakker’s writing is really good. It’s philosophical, thoughtful, and evocative. His background in philosophy shines through, and while it’s not the main thing I look for in fantasy, it definitely enhances the story.

One of the most impressive aspects of Bakker's writing is how he handles complex philosophical and theological ideas without bogging down the narrative. There are discussions about free will, fate, and the nature of truth and power, all woven together into the story. It challenges you to think about the character's motivations and the societal structures they navigate, without ever feeling preachy or overbearing.

The story also explores the often messy intersection of faith, politics, and personal ambition. Bakker doesn't shy away from showing the manipulations, hypocrisies, and cruelties inherent in large-scale religious movements, drawing clear inspiration from real-world history. And yet, there's something beautiful about how characters like Kellhus who seems to be on the cusp of using belief as a weapon. I am excited because Cnaiur asks the question of whether or not faith is truly our beliefs or the ones imposed on us by others.

But I have to be honest—this book isn’t for everyone. It goes to some very dark places. There’s violence, sexual assault, and some brutal moments that are hard to stomach. Yet, none of it feels like it’s there for shock value. The darkness in Bakker’s world feels purposeful. It’s a grim world, yes, but it’s also filled with hope, courage, and love. Still, the content will turn some people away, and that’s completely valid.

**TLDR Conclusion:** *Let us be moved, you and I, by the things themselves. Let us discover each other.*

Ultimately, *The Darkness That Comes Before* was a book I couldn’t put down. It’s become one of my favorite books of all time. The world feels so real, like I was reading history written by its survivors. That said, it’s not for everyone. If you’re not a fan of slow-burn narratives or dark, challenging content, this might not be the book for you. But if you love grimdark fantasy, immersive world-building, and deep philosophical themes, I highly recommend it. If you decide to embark on this journey, I don’t think you’ll regret it. *The Darkness That Comes Before* is a beautifully written, dark, and immersive fantasy that isn’t for the faint of heart. If you enjoy complex characters, intricate world-building, and philosophical themes, this book is worth the read—just be prepared for some heavy content.",fantasy
(request) Looking for stories with a SPECIFIC type of OP MC,"This may not be the right Subreddit for my request, as I am looking for a type of story that can be anything, litrpg, novel, webnovel, manhwa, it doesn't matter.

I have searched high and low for a specific type of OP MC stories and have found almost nothing. Sure there are hundreds of posts recommending some series with a protagonist that is marginally stronger than his peers or can tussle with those in a weight class above his own. Maybe they have dumb luck or plot armor, or maybe they are actually quite OP, but exist in a world full of other similarly powerful characters.

What I am looking for is for a story where the MCs power is the driving conflict, the initiating event. I want an MC whose power alone is like the creation of the nuclear bomb. I want the story to take place on earth, I want the MCs power to throw the world into chaos, I want governments to attempt to control him, kidnap loved ones, I want the MCs actions to have serious consequences. I want him to LOSE his loved ones, I want him to underestimate the lengths an established government will go to keep their power, I want him to lose control, to level cities. I want a realistic depiction of an ACTUALLY OP MC, an MC who must answer the question, what do you do when no one can stop you. 

The closest story to this theme is John Conroe's Demon Accords. The emergent power of Chris Gordon is enough of a threat to established powers for governments to &gt;!attempt to hit him with a ballistic missile, kidnap his goddaughter, shoot him down with gunships, and lock him up in classified black budget prisons!&lt;. Chris responds in equal measures, &gt;!attacking government facilities, threatening to defect to foreign countries, pulling satellites out of the sky, even bombing New Hampshire with a fucking asteroid!!&lt;

There is also the lesser known Manhwa Rooftop Sword Master, which has a good depiction of a superhuman MC vs. a modern military, but is severely crippled by its story.

I just have all these ideas I want to see in a story, things I feel would be realistic. Humans are generally superstitious animals, people believe in all powerful gods with no evidence but an ancient book. I find it highly likely that a powerful superhuman would quickly be worshiped as a god, that new religions would crop up, likely committing atrocities in the name of their “god”. I also find it likely that world governments would be shaking in their boots at the thought of a power they don't control, that a new arms race to create super humans would emerge, that they would do anything in their power to control or kill the variable. Maybe kidnap his family, put them in a government facility with a bunch of “expendables” and a nuke, leak the location, when the MC comes to rescue them, the nuke goes off, kills the family, injures MC, MC gets captured, attempted mind control, government blames all the deaths on the MC, Media says that the MC was a terrorist and praise the government for stopping him. Then perhaps the MC breaks out, is enraged by the loss of his family, levels Washington, further convincing people that he is the villain, I don't know, just random ideas. 

This can be literally any type of book, I know because defiance of the fall came very close to being this interesting. Had &gt;!Zack's sister been killed before he could rescue her, had Zack then decided enough is enough and wiped out the so-called New World Government, had his power been enough for the New World Government to really go all out from the start on the whole “control or kill” thing,!&lt; then that book series would have been exactly what I wanted.

Sorry this is such a ramble, I just feel like it is impossible to find an OP MC story that has the true power difference and consequences that I want, they are all just “MC has slight upper hand or cheat” kind of things. Any recommendations would be a godsend. Thank you!",fantasy

Are there any stories about the ideas and cultural clash of religious / magical spirituality to transhumanism?,"I will admit I am unsure of what I exactly I am looking for.

Perhaps clash of concepts and ideals between late stage transhumanism and traditional religious spirituality or magical perspectives.

By traditional perspectives, I mean the idea of life and death, what human is what man's place in the world is.

Late stage transhumanism includes the idea of being able to back yourself up and have multiple copies. Another concept being mental modification, blurring the lines between human and ai. And overall changing of the very definition of what human is and what death is. 

A made up examples of what I might be trying to find. 
""A story about the Gods trying to understand what humanity has become.""

""A story about a old monster of the dark, now unsure what it's prey has even become.""

""A story about a man from the far past having to come to terms with far more advanced future, primarily a dialogue between two characters.""

""A story about a magical civilization that has accidentally opened a gate to a world far different from theirs where technology, not magic was the path taken. And the very definition of mortal, nor immortal apples.""

Tarvolon Reads a. . . Graphic Novel? A Review of Shubeik Lubeik by Deena Mohamed," *This review can also be found* [*on my blog*](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/09/15/fantasy-graphic-novel-review-shubeik-lubeik-by-deena-mohamed/)*.* 

I did not grow up reading comic books, so perhaps it’s no surprise that as an adult,  I haven’t gotten into graphic novels. I read *Watchmen* in college and that might be it…ever. But the English translation of *Shubeik Lubeik* by Deena Mohamed came with enough hype from people that don’t normally read graphic novels that I decided to give it a try, and I’m glad I did. 

*Shubeik Lubeik* takes place in Cairo, in a world where magic wishes are real, are sold commercially, and are heavily regulated by various governments. The story is broken into three sections, each starring the owners of three first-class wishes—powerful, expensive, and rarely seen in the kind of neighborhood where most of the book is set. While the lives of the three characters do intersect, the main thrust of the novel is the individual struggles facing the three characters as they determine how best to use the wishes. 

I’ve read so few graphic novels that I don’t have much point of comparison with the artwork, but I certainly found it compelling, in a way that communicated a lot about the characters and setting and generally made for a smooth reading experience that made me want to keep turning the pages. The graphic format certainly allows some flexibility that a standard novel lacks, and *Shubeik Lubeik* used this flexibility to great effect, with a depressed character repeatedly graphing their mental states and with interstitial infographics on the history and usage of wishes—my particular favorite being a short list of regional slang terms for third-class wishes. 

And while there may not be one overarching plot, I found the three constituent stories individually all quite interesting. The best executed and most compelling of the bunch was the second, featuring a college student from an extremely wealthy family struggling through deep depression. I’ve already mentioned the graphs, which were a nice touch, but so many aspects of this storyline just felt so perfectly done, from how the character’s understanding of their own privilege only worsens their mental state to them confusing a short-term feeling of fulfillment for a whole and complete cure. 

The first story doesn’t go quite as deep into the character, but it does plenty to flesh out the world, with a whole lot to say about abuse of power. It may not be the star of the book, but it serves very well setting the table for the stories to come. And there are some touching character moments, even if it’s not a character study in the same way as the story that follows. 

The final piece of the novel presents an utterly compelling character dilemma, though the one where I was least satisfied with the resolution. I’m a big fan of devout religious characters in fantasy, and the lead of the third section is deeply concerned with living up to the moral precepts of Islam, including a strict prohibition on the use of wishes. There’s strong reasoning behind this prohibition, and it dovetails wonderfully with some of the little worldbuilding bits about the debates on whether or not wishes are sentient. But instead of digging into that element, the author handwaves it away, instead using the storyline to comment on colonial propaganda. Don't get me wrong, colonial propaganda is *also* a topic that dovetails very nicely with other elements of the story, but choosing this storyline means closing the door on another that had shown early signs of promise. 

But even if I was disappointed with the resolution of the religious dilemma, I still found the third character fascinating, and his story doubly so for including an extended flashback to the heart-wrenching circumstances behind one of his acquaintances using a wish of her own. This fourth story is told in such depth that its subject almost feels like a fourth protagonist, and it's in real contention for the best in the book. 

While the three individual sections mostly stand alone, cameos by characters from other parts help make the overall story feel cohesive, and the way the ending calls back to some of the very earliest pages helps send the book out on a satisfying note. Overall, *Shubeik Lubeik* was something of a revelation to a reader who doesn’t read many graphic novels at all. All three segments had extremely strong elements—with the second in particular being a true standout—and there was enough connective tissue to make the story as a whole feel cohesive. I have my complaints, but the art, worldbuilding, and characters were all exceptional. I’m probably not going to become a regular with graphic novels, but if this is the level of quality on display, I’m certainly not going to avoid them either. 

*Recommended if you like:* graphic novels, non-Western settings, character-driven stories. 

*Can I use it for* [*Bingo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bt4iqf/official_rfantasy_2024_book_bingo_challenge/)*?* It's hard mode for POC Author if you use the date of translation (otherwise, it's normal mode). It's also hard mode for Character with a Disability if you're counting mental illness (which I think is well within the spirit of the square), and it contains Reference Materials and Multiple POVs. 

*Overall rating:* 18 of Tar Vol's 20. Five stars on Goodreads. ",fantasy
What is your niche preferred book genre?,"I have a very niche book genre I prefer to read. 
Fantasy;

Books that feels like a D&amp;D session,"I'm looking for fantasy books that capture the feeling of a chaotic, comedic D&amp;D session. Never played D&amp;D, though I'm interested, but I've been binge watching, Viva La Dirt League's D&amp;D sessions set in their NPC world. And I couldn't help but enjoy the way the characters were going and the world were reacting to their clusterfuck of actions.

I want to read the kind of absurd stories and hilarious things are happening constantly, with characters making questionable decisions that lead to unexpected and funny consequences. I'm particularly interested in books that blend humor with fantasy in a way that feels spontaneous and unpredictable, much like a group of friends navigating a D&amp;D campaign. For example, Bob, one of the characters, is notorious for missing his attacks or failing skill checks at the worst possible moments, often leading to even more ridiculous and chaotic outcomes. The group planning these awesome scenes then BOOM all goes to shit with the first roll and we gotta deal with the consequences of it. Another concept that happens often in the sessions is, the heroes being offered hospitality after a quest, but they overstay, becoming too relaxed. The host then realizes just how chaotic and insane they are, leading to awkward and hilarious attempts to get them to leave. 

And that's just the cherry top of what happens. It goes deeper, and more hilarious. 

There's a few books that I've already read that feels like this

* **Kings of the Wyld**, is the absolute closest book that feels exactly like what I'm looking for. I've read it's sequel but wasn't much into it.
* **Riyria**, both Relevations and Chronicles, is less close to what I'm looking for but it does have a really nice and memorable duo. It does feel like if this were a D&amp;D session, the players are taking it more seriously.+
* **Dungeon Crawler Carl**, such a fun series.

What I don't think that fits the bill at all is the satire series, like **Discworld** or **Orconomics**, or satire fantasy in general. 

Cheers!

Favorite type of dragon? Smart or stupid?,"Just replaying Skyrim and it dawned on me that the dragons in-game are intelligent, almost demigod-like beings (at least Alduin), having their own dialect and cultures, even enslaving past generations of humanoids. This made me realize that the portrayal of dragons in fiction varies between smart, somewhat cosmically powered beings like Smaug and wild, animalistic... animals like in Game of Thrones.

Just curious as to which variant people prefer. I myself go back and forth and believe it depends on the portrayal as in my opinion, dragons in fiction are somewhat overused, albeit for good reason as who doesn't like a giant fire-breathing dinosaur",fantasy

What novels pull off feminist themes well?,"I want to ask for recommendations for fantasy novels with feminist themes that may or may not take place in historical-inspired settings, whether its ancient, medieval, early modern or even the 19th century.

Some pitfalls in fantasy works vaguely based on societies that existed in the past that try to handle feminism is making the female MC be a girlboss who fights with a sword and dislikes traditionally feminine activities like embroidery and sewing-**think Merida from Brave**-and I think that's not only a massive cliche but actively harmful to feminism because it derides activities considered feminine to be ""inferior"" to masculine activities and work.

The treatment of sadistic and often sexual/sexualized violence and abuse of women as normative, often serving as little more than shock value to tell the reader **""this society is really harsh on women""** is another pet peeve of mine. I hate when vaguely ""medieval"" or whatever fantasy worlds project modern gender roles onto the past, by which I mean assuming that what is considered ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" in the modern day would've been considered so in all societies and time-periods. 

For example in ancient Japan and China, the ideal man was a scholar and poet with an appreciation for beauty and who cries easily. In pre-modern Europe warriors, kings and politicians cried floods of tears to show grief, in contrast to modern gender roles where men crying is considered a show of weakness regardless of context. 

Not to mention that a woman-warrior wasn't an unknown concept in the past; there are plenty of medieval and renaissance ballads speaking of women putting on armor and fighting with swords for their fathers and brothers. Women of the royal class also played important roles as diplomats passing information back and forth between their families and owned land in their own right.

Basically, I want a fantasy work which actually does a good job in deconstructing the patriarchy, the concept of gender and the associated gender roles, avoids being cliche and heavy-handed in promoting its message and has good worldbuilding, especially when it comes to gender roles-what activities and behaviors are ascribed to men and women (and possibly other genders.",fantasy

Book review: Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi,"https://preview.redd.it/jdxihm0un0pd1.jpg?width=994&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec44d980d2f720ce98275e305e5480336bb713c

**BIngo squares:** Disability (HM),First in a Series, Published in 2024, Dreams, Reference Materials, Under the Surface. 

**Publisher:** Knopf (Jul 09, 2024) **Length:** 576 pages (hardcover) **Formats:** audiobook, ebook, hardcover 

So, I’ve found my new favorite book of 2024. I’ve always enjoyed political intrigue, deeply personal stakes, and secondary Machiavellian characters. In Navola, Paolo Bacigalupi brings goods to the table!

The story follows **Davico di Regulai**, the reluctant heir to a powerful banking family in the city of Navola. Unlike his ruthless father, Devonaci, who controls the city from the shadows, Davico dreams of a simpler life, one filled with honesty, connection to nature, and kindness. Power and manipulation don’t appeal to him, but alas, he has little choice since his life is just a piece of the giant, ambitious puzzle played by his father.

Some reviewers complain about following the story through the POV of the least interesting character, but I disagree. I think Davico’s goodness and naivete make characters like Devonaci, Lady Furia, and Stilettotore even more fascinating and mysterious. I mean, think of Lord Vetinari in Discworld novels - he’s so fascinating because we witness his machinations mostly through the eyes of lesser minds and this trick emphasises his cunning and ingenuity.

Davico feels inadequate and trapped in a world that perceives kindness as a weakness to exploit and use against you. But I love coming-of-age arcs, and Bacigalupi is shockingly good at writing them. A word of caution, though—he’s also extremely good and ruthless at destroying kind characters. Davico’s foster sister, Celia, plays a crucial role in his life as his closest friend and potential love interest. The dark machinations of his father and his enemies make everything much harder for them and lay the groundwork for shocking twists and turns that left me staring blankly at the pages, muttering WTF.

There’s a fantasy element too—the dragon’s eye kept by Devonaci plays a pivotal role in Davico’s fate. But why on earth would I spoil it for you? Anyway, the relic, a remnant of a long-lost age, suggests the lingering presence of magic in a world increasingly dominated by human ambition and greed. And it’s not looking kindly at the world or its inhabitants.

Navola is a brilliant book. It takes the classic coming-of-age story, sets it in a fascinating Renaissance Italy inspired world and makes it a part of a brutal power play and political intrigue. It plays with coming-of-age storyline beats but twists them significantly. Things you’re sure will happen, won’t happen. Things you’re sure won’t happen, will happen.

Bacigalupi’s world-building is excellent—Navola comes alive through its detailed landscapes, complex societal structures and interactions, and the language filled with faux-Italian / italianate words. The di Regulai family’s influence over the city is immense, and Bacigalupi captures the tension between power-hungry factions and players. He also shows that sometimes calculated violence and unrelenting political maneuvering is the only way to maintain power.

I loved the prose and found it elegant and immersive. The novel’s pacing, while slower in its beginning, builds to a shocking twist that will change everything about the story. Anyway, the opening chapters consist of vignettes that shaped key moments in Davico’s coming-of-age arc. I found them incredibly effective at setting the tone and making readers lower their guard.

In short, Navola is brilliant and juggles heartfelt moments with outbursts of calculated violence and extreme bleakness. I loved every second of it. Some reviews mention it’s a standalone story and while it can be read as such despite an open ending, I choose to think it’s just the beginning of a brilliant epic series. ",fantasy
Clan Novel: Ravnos by Kathleen Ryan - A V:TM story about a murder hobo who hates the main plot 3/5,"https://preview.redd.it/kmb14k4480pd1.jpg?width=844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c50640cf69e09ff9ec3fcb9f69ecd61789a5c54

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-clan-novel-ravnos-by-kathleen-ryan/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-clan-novel-ravnos-by-kathleen-ryan/)

CLAN NOVEL: RAVNOS is the eighth novel in the Clan Novel series for the Vampire: The Masquerade line of tabletop RPGs. I’ve been re-reading the series for the past couple of years and enjoying the world of conspiracies, action, and interlocking plotlines. The series is not without its flaws and wildly changes tones as well as themes depending on the characters. However, it is still something that I think to be quite fun. I also note that the twelve book series has its own smaller series within the books, effectively following authors continuing their own stories when they do two or more books. In this case, Ravnos is a sequel to the Setite novel.

The premise is that Hesha Ruhadze, Follower of Set high priest, has managed to finally acquire the Eye of Hazimel. The Eye is effectively the One Ring of Sauron (or Eye of Vecna) in that it bestows fantastic powers to its wielder but eventually warps your mind into a parody of itself. It also attracts the attention of Hazimel himself, who is restricted to using Khail Ravana as a minion in order to retrieve it. Khail finds himself stumbling on the erstwhile childe of Hesha, Elizabeth Dimitrios, and the Gangrel Ramona, who all have their own stake in the quest.

The biggest flaw of this novel is Khalil Ravana himself. He is, deliberately, a complete scumbag. He’s a thieving, scheming, snivelling, cowardly irredeemable piece of \*\*\*\*. You can be a bad person as well as a protagonistin Vampire: The Masquerade, it’s almost mandatory, but Khalil is closer to Gollum rather than, say, Saruman. This is a book written by a woman but there’s a scene where Khalil waits in a woman’s apartment, watches her undress, then forcibly restrains her before draining her dry in a scene deliberately meant to remind you of what it does.

Indeed, the fact that Khalil gets away with so much awful evil crap is something that makes the book a chore. Vampire novels almost inevitably work best when their condition is a curse and Khalil doesn’t have enough self-awareness to be cursed by it. He’s a living argument for why Paths of Enlightenment aren’t really appropriate for a vampire game or, at least, would be if he cared enough about the Path of Paradox to be anything more than “the path of what I was going to do anyway.” Indeed, the best part of Khalil’s story is when he chides Ramona for racism against Romani people, saying, yes, HE is a murderous thief but that’s just him. His family is rightfully ashamed of him.

The best parts of the books are Hesha, Ramona, and Elizabeth’s sections. Hesha may be every bit as evil as Khalil, being a literal priest of a god of evil (which Set wasn’t in RL but is in V:TM) but he has far more depth as a person. Ramona is a vampire who wants to be “good” but is rather easily led astray by Khalil’s transparent lies. Elizabeth seems to have fallen in from another genre of horror entirely and is as terrified of Khalil as she is of Hesha despite the former being more Buffy vampire than Dracula in terms of intelligence.

If it sounds like I’m insulting the book, I’m not, well, not entirely. None of this is due to bad writing. Kathleen Ryan is fully capable of writing fantastic vampire fiction. I know, because she’s the author of Setite and that’s one of my favorite V:TM books. However, the protagonist is someone she tries to contrast against all of the others and he’s just not a great place to be in the headspace of. Despite this, I found myself still interested in the plotline between them. The Eye of Hazimel is the most D&amp;D-like artifact in V:TM but it’s very strangeness is one of the reasons the plot works. No one else really looks for magical artifacts in the setting, so the one-eyed man is king.

And if you’d like to pick up the latest book, you can find it here:

·         [*When Wizards Follow Fools*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGZDWBXR/)

 

If you’re not familiar with the series, here’s some info:

[Arcane Ascension](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P6T5K3Y?binding=kindle_edition&amp;qid=1666583838) follows Corin Cadence, a young man who seeks magical power in order to uncover the fate of his brother, Tristan, who disappeared into a colossal tower five years earlier.

Subgenre and style wise, it’s a magical academy progression fantasy inspired by games JRPGs **Final Fantasy**, **Lufia**, **Bravely Default**, and **Trails of Cold Steel**. The story has a strong emphasis on learning how magic works and figuring out clever ways to exploit it. Our protagonist, Corin, isn’t a classical hero — while he certainly can fight, he’s much more of a crafter and support archetype, and he’s often in situations he can’t resolve with brute force.

Arcane Ascension takes place in a high magic setting where magical marks called attunements grant vast powers to individuals who take ""Judgments"" inside a colossal tower to earn them. Each attunement has a distinctive power set analogous to a character class in a game – for example, Guardians gain abilities that excel in front-line combat, Summoners can forge pacts with monsters and learn to draw on their power, and Elementalists can hurl fire and lightning.

The magic system is extremely detailed, and if you don’t like magic theory lectures, it might not be for you. On the soft-to-hard magic scale, this leans very heavily toward the hard side.

This is also a LGBTQIA+ friendly series, with many characters that are LGBTQIA+ (including the lead). The romantic elements in the story are extremely light, but if you can’t stand the idea of LGBTQIA+ relationships, you’re probably better off skipping this series.

I hope everyone enjoys the free books if you pick them up — and, of course, Book 5 if you get to that point!

"""Easter Eggs"" in Fantasy novels?","An ""Easter egg"" is something hidden In literary terms, Easter eggs are items that authors hide in their books for their readers to find.  An Easter egg could be a character, a place, an object, or a bit of dialogue. 

For example, GRRM hid many Easter eggs throughout A Song of Ice and Fire: the characters Arya, Jon Snow, and Pyat Prees follow the paths of Tad Williams' earlier characters Marya, Simon Snow, and Pryrates.  As well, he refers to Lord Willums' feuding sons, Josua and Elyas, and at one point refers to the Three Stooges of 20th Century fame. These could be considered Easter eggs.

In 2014, it was discovered that there's a hidden pattern in the chapter titles of Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series. The sixth chapter of each book in MS&amp;T, all throughout, have ongoing themes in the titles. Chapter 6 is about death, Chapter 12 is about birds. Chapter 18 is about the Sithi, Chapter 24 is about dogs/beasts, Chapter 30 is about thousands, Chapter 36 is about wounds, Chapter 42 is about trees.

Where do I go from here? AKA Help a beginner figure out his tastes,"I've gotten pretty into audiobooks in the last year or so, but a lot of the ""10/10"" recommendations don't seem to land for me, or at least not to a degree it seemingly did for a lot of other people.

Brandon Sanderson was the author that started this whole journey purely because of how often I saw this name mentioned in recommendation threads, so I went through his biggest works first.

**The Mistborn Saga** - 6/10

The first book, at least until its final acts, was amazing. The original magic system, the Ocean's Eleven plot, the infiltration of high society and its politics - loved it. It takes a bit of a narrative shift in subsequent books, however, and I believe that's where it lost me. It's been a little over a year since I read it, and I couldn't for the life of me tell you the events that transpired after the first book and until the ending of the third. 

**The Mistborn Saga: Era Two** - 4/10

I don't even know how I got through these, at no point did I care for the characters or its made-for-tv plot. Just finished it out of what felt like obligation.

**The Stormlight Archive** - 6/10

Again, loved the first book, mainly for Kaladin and the Bridge Four shenanigans. Later books though, and especially Rhythm of War, started to feel really bloated and rambly. I remember really struggling to keep focus during some of the Parshendi chapters and the flashbacks. What also made later books lose their charm for me was that it all essentially boiled down to super human armies and even more super human main characters duking it out, which in my mind didn't make for particularly great reading. Now that I think about it, my enjoyment throughout this series was inversely proportional to the strength of the leading cast.

This is where I decided that it's time to branch out to some other highly recommended works. I listened to a few more than what's listed here, but they're not too relevant to the subreddit, so I'll skip those.

**Dungeon Crawler Carl** - 7/10

DCC opened my eyes to the litrpg genre. I couldn't get enough of the systems, the upgrades, the rules, the hints of the bigger picture. But, the main meat of the books, the ""dungeon crawling"" itself, struggled to keep my attention. I couldn't wait till the next Odette segment, till the next recap episode, the next lootbox opening and the next level up, and everything inbetween was just a necessary trudge to get to the good parts again. I think it's partly to do with the transient nature of the floors - none of what Carl does within them feels like it matters beyond what persistent benefit he can gain from it, this slice of the world and its NPCs aren't going to be down on the next floor, so why care? Later books start to shift focus more toward the big picture, so I'll say that it actually got better as the series progressed in that regard. I'm *really* excited for book 7.

As an afterthought, I think this series helped me finally put a finger on a problem I had with it and some of my prior reads - I can't really follow action sequences. No matter how lengthy and descriptive they are, it all blurs together to just 'X is fighting Y'. I wonder how much that could affect enjoyment of a book.

Also, I can't not mention Jeff Hays, the narrator for the series. The phenomenal talent of this man made me realize just how much of a difference an amazing narrator can make.

**Red Rising** - 4/10

I wanted to drop this series after every book, but always continued for one reason or another.


The first book was so much of a cliched mediocrity that it made me appreciate the authors that I read prior more, but people swore that it gets better, so I kept going. The hunger games aspect of it was enjoyable on a very base level, but for some reason I have a feeling a myriad of other books have done a much better job of it.

Book 2 does expand into a full fledged space opera, but the amateurish, indulgent writing never really got any better. The political intrigue and the mole subplot did remind me a lot of the first Mistborn book in a lot of good ways, but there wasn't much of it to be found as it quickly devolves into a conflict of two well defined factions.

All in all, the premise is silly, the characters are two-dimensional caricatures, the twists are either blatant ass-pulls or blatantly obvious with no in-between, and what is it with the blasted howling??

I'm on book 3 right now and, unless it pulls something extraordinary, there is near zero chance I'll stay with the series after.

**Final thoughts**

Honestly, I don't think there's much to be gathered from this as the sample size is too small. Maybe that I like fraction politics and game systems?

So I guess what I'm really asking is, did you have some of the same problems with these acclaimed books that I did, and if so, what is *your* true 10/10?",fantasy

Good Romantasy recs?,"I typically enjoy epic/high fantasy series like the Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive, the Witcher. But lately I’ve been itching to read a more slutty series (or novel). Unfortunately, Sanderson is a bit too Mormon when it comes to romance. 

I have read the Fourth Wing and ACOTAR books - I actually really enjoyed ACOTAR, Fourth Wing was good but not my favorite (did not like the 2nd book). I really find myself turned off by the YA approach a lot of romantasy books take.  I prefer books that aren’t about children or only contain romance consisting of the woman’s perspective of a male protagonist.

What are your favourite “unpleasant” fantasy settings? ,"There are some settings that are very unpleasant for the occupants but deliciously enjoyable to read about. Some examples: 

* The city of Tarbean in The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, a rough urban location where the main character is forced to survive as a beggar and thief 
* The war camps at the Shattered Plains in The Stormlight Archive by Brando Sando, which sit on vast plateaus separated by chasms - occupied by soldiers, camp followers and slaves all living in semi-permanent shelters 
* Canaan House in Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, a palatial building that is now falling apart (but there are fortunately automated skeletons to fill in the swimming pool!) 
* The city of Belisaere in Garth Nix’s Sabriel, once a magnificent capital but now clings to the vestiges of grandeur and turns a blind eye to scavengers and slavery
* Lowtown of the titular book by Daniel Polanski, a post-war city riddled with crime and poverty and corruption 

I love reading about these settings, which demand that the characters keep their wits about them. They have to watch their purses, bribe and threaten (or get bribed and threatened), and struggle with their morals. What are your personal favourites?",fantasy
"Recommend me steampunk books, please!","I've been trying to find them for a while now and haven't had much success just searching online for steampunk media, let alone fantasy books. 

In fact, I'm afraid the word might have... lost the meaning a little bit. But anyways, by steampunk I understand a story taking place in/being inspired by the first industrial revolution. 

So, heavy machinery, big urban centers, the normal worker now works in a factory, not a farm, etc. Victorian era is usually related, of course, and I love it, but it's not a must, once the world of the story might be completely made up so the industrial revolution would be different. And, of course, steam (maybe this is implicit in the machinery part, but wanted to make it clear nonetheless). 

Having said that, I'm opened to anything remotely steampunk. The story can be focused/heavily influenced by industrial revolution OR it's just a nice detail in the setting, and so on.

Looking for any stories where the protagonist adopts the child of his enemy,"Willing to accept stories where they’re not the protagonist it could be a side character too. But I’m mainly looking for any stories where a character ends up adopting and taking in the child of his worst enemy or a villain or someone that caused him/her a lot of pain. 

Can be angsty or wholesome. Either works.

Character could be hesitant and even resentful at first because it’s the child of a bad person but eventually they open up to the child and love them like their own. 

Can be a couple too. That’s usually never seen 

I’m also interested in any long running series where we see said child grow up and you get to see how different things were from then and now. 

And while we’re at it, I’m open to ANY stories where a character takes in a child that isn’t his/her own. 

And while we’re at it I’m also open to any stories where an adopted child feels like they stands out or feels like the “fake” child compared to his/her siblings. Wholesome or angsty or both. ",fantasy

Recommendations: Humorous / Lowish Fantasy?,"Hello (and pardon yet another recommendation thread!), 

I'm hoping to start another fantasy series soon (ideally audiobook format)!  I'm a fan of lowish fantasy with sharp, witty writing, humor, and memorable characters (and tend to get bored by excessive world building and high fantasy tropes). 

I haven't read too much fantasy, but am a huge fan of Joe Abercrombie's First Law universe and George R.R. Martin's SoIAF series (also appreciate classics like LoTR).  Those two series really interested me due to the combination of relatively low fantasy, great characters, and hilarious/witty dialogue.  I'm hoping to find something in a similar vein (especially if there is a well-narrated audiobook option!).  I've personally struggled with series that delve a little more into high fantasy and dense world building (Wheel of Time; Salvatore books, etc.). 

Of the series I've researched, I've identified a few promising initial leads (any feedback given my tastes would be greatly appreciated, plus comments on any other titles!): 

(1) Gentleman Bastards / The Lies of Locke Lamora (could be the best fit based on reviews I've skimmed?); 

(2) Mistborn or The Stormlight Archive (heard great things about both series but suspect it might delve a little more into intricate world building and less characterization?);

(3) Kingkiller / The Name of the Wind (a few friends claim the writing is exceptionally good, but the series is unfinished and uncertain how well it meshes with my tastes).

Your favorite fantasy party? (as in group) Feel free to include movies and games!,"I recently realized how rare it is to have a good balance when creating the main group

So I'm asking for examples. In novels, I can think of Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas; or the Harry Potter trio but outside of that there are few parties that I love because they make for a good party, if that make sense?

Goku-Yamcha-Bulma, the ruroni kenshin gang, FMA's mustang group, and a few others

In movies, there's the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Star Wars 7-some from A New Hope

In video games, there's the parties of Final Fantasy 7, 9, 10; Tales of Symphonia and Vesperia; Grandia; several different groups from Kingdom Hearts (with KH1 Sora Donald Goofy being one of my faves)

Recommendations for Adult Fiction that fits the vibe of ‘The Goose Girl’,"I was looking through some childhood books today and found my old copy of The Goose Girl by Shannon Hale. I adored it in elementary school and can’t really recall reading anything that’s scratched that itch in the same way. 

I’m curious if there’s any adult fiction that riffs on a similar premise (person of important sent to an unfamiliar land that is replaced by someone they trust and now has to navigate the situation). I’m not really as interested if the character doesn’t *know* they’ve been replaced (for example, a princess switched at birth learning say 20 years later they’re actually a princess).

I’m open to standard fantasy, romantasy, even sci-fi if it’s very on theme. Any recommendations you have would be great!",fantasy
The Dragonbone Chair,"Hey guys first post here. So I finished the book and I'd heard that it was too slow and a lot of people give it up and don't finish but I'm really glad I did. After a while I got used to the pace and I loved the way it was structured. I think the greatest praise I have for this book is in 2 things.
The first being I kept waiting for Simon to show some incredible Luke Skywalker style abilities that the Heros Journey usually has but aside from a slight bit he never really came off thaaat special and mostly seemed a confused young boy which I thought was the exact right portrayal. Secondly often in books and shows especially fantasy I have sub plots that I enjoy more and I'm just slogging through the other subplots so I can get back to the one I'm interested in but in the Dragonbone Chair once I was done with 40% of the book I loved each plot and wasn't necessarily waiting to go back to any specific one in fact I was ok with wherever the writer took me. Overall really loved it and I'm looking forward to starting Stone of Farewell!",fantasy
Just Finished the Darkness that Comes Before,"So I’m sure like many people I often search for a type of novel series I’m looking for and so frequently this series is one I’ve had constantly come up. I’m really into dark fantasy but the main reason I tried this one is because I heard it had a large cast and complex world building. I had been kind of looking for something like Wheel of Time, Malazan, or A Song of Ice and Fire.

Anyway, I think this series really hit the nail on the head for a lot of what I’ve been looking for. The characters are very interesting and the dialogue is spectacular, probably my favorite aspect of the novel. Kellhus was the character who stood out the most to me and I’m really intrigued to see where his character goes. He sort of feels like the Chosen One trope but distorted, much in a way like Paul Atriedes is (and I had heard that the biggest influences for this series were Dune and the Lord of the Rings).

Anyway, there’s a lot to love so far. I think the descriptions are excellent, the characters and dialogue are deep, and the action is also very cool and epic. There are some icks I get here and there with just overly weird sexual stuff, which seems to be the turnoff for a lot of people with this series, and I get that. But there’s much more than that to the series and I’m feeling invested in continuing.

For the first book I’d give it a B (I dislike ten or five star scales so go by letter ratings), which is a pretty good score. Anyway, for the most part it seems to be what I was looking for, which is great. I’m assuming the books get much better from here but we’ll see.",fantasy

Mass Market Paperbacks are dying and it's making it impossible to afford epic fantasy,"When I was in 7th grade or so, I started my first modern epic fantasy series after reading Lord of the Rings, the Malazan Book of the Fallen. Even back then in 2014, Gardens of the Moon was $6 or $7 for a mass market paperback, if I remember correctly. Since the series has no box sets, it made it about $70 to complete Malazan.

It's been almost a decade since then. Malazan is still affordable, thank fuck, due to the legacy mass market paperbacks never getting replaced. But I decided I might want to try reading Realm of the Elderlings. I went into Barnes &amp; Noble, and there are no longer the old MMPBs, the series has been reprinted with new covers, that are trade paperback only, and I saw that it was god damn $18 for the first book in the series. I then checked the price for the entire series from Barnes &amp; Noble - $240 to complete it, not including Rain Wild Chronicles, because it's not being printed in the new cover!

Kindles killing mass market paperbacks has basically made it impossible for me to want to commit to a series, because if I know it's only in trade paperbacks minimum price, I'm going to have to spend a frankly absurd amount of money. I wish there was a way out of this.",fantasy
Looking for fantasy series/books where the primary antagonist has a certain goal,"Looking for a series/book where the main antagonist, probably foil to the protagonist, is on a path to either birthing, resurrecting, or summoning an ancient higher power to either validate themselves or answer their questions. Like a paragon for themselves (and maybe those like them) to take solace and find meaning in their own lives that relies on the higher power's birth and choice once it's born.

For example, in the visual novel series &gt;!fate stay night!&lt; , heavy spoilers: 

&gt;!The main antagonist, a man who's nature yearns for evil, but was raised as a devout Christian, tries to birth Angra Mainyu (zoroastrian spirit/deity) in order to find an answer to whether it was a mistake that he was born ""evil"" and if there is meaning in him being born. This all rests upon whether or not Angra Mainyu contently chooses to fulfill the primary function of ""evil"" when it is born, and if it doesn't take guilt in doing what it does!&lt;

Venting on Queer Allegory and Epic Fantasy (Possible Licanius Trilogy and Wheel of Time spoilers),"I'm presently reading the Licanius Trilogy and it's sparked some feelings on the relationship of queer themes and epic fantasy that I have to get out somewhere.

Within the Licanius Trilogy specifically, through the middle of book 2, there are two moments in specific that have made me cognizant of the ways in which epic fantasies often fails to capitalize on the existence of queer allegory and queer people within the fictions of their worlds. Both these scenes center on Wirr. In the first book there's a tension between Wirr and Aelric when they first meet that I've come to see in queer fiction as an indicator of a potential romance between those characters. The fact that this doesn't pay off in the way I might have expected, while not noteworthy in and of itself, feels like a severely lost opportunity in combination with the larger themes around Wirr (lack of familial and cultural acceptance for an inborn trait the inheritance of which he has no control over, desires to change laws which place unfair restrictions on those like himself).

Once I got to the scene where Wirr argues with his mother about the role of the North Warden, and the changes he made to the tenets I couldn't read that scene as anything other than a direct allegory for a coming out story, but one told without any real recognition for the fact that that was the allegory being utilized. And this sparked for me my disappointment in another similar series to recognize the fruitful ground it had for queer narrative and allegory.

I know the Wheel of Time predates much of the movement to queer acceptance, I understand it was written by a devout Christian man of an older generation, but this was clearly someone who wasn't entirely oblivious to feminist perspective, and who actively wanted to explore the nature of gender and gender roles within society. I get that Robert Jordan may not have been aware of the existence of trans people, but between his ability to imply queer relationships and validate polyamory it feels like 1) he should have been, or 2) that his inability to conceptualize of them within and solely for the mechanics of his world indicates a severe lack of imagination on his part. I mean this is a world where reincarnation exists, one's relationship to magic is defined by the gender of one's soul, and one's cultural accpetance is heavily defined by the gender of one's appearance and the gender of one's magic. How can you not ask the question of what happens when someone who appears to be male has a feminine soul or connection to magic or vice versa?

I love that there are so many queer stories in this space. I'm not saying that fantasy is devoid of queer narrative or even that it's entirely absent from epic fantasy (Priory of the Orange Tree, out here holding it down). I'm just asking, why does it feel like in every epic fantasy story that is ripe for queer rep and allegory, it never comes to fruition? Like Priory was great and maybe I'm misremembering or missed something entirely, but nothing in the world of Priory or the story that happened there in demanded the existence of queer characters, or held the power of queer allegory to the degree of what I'm seeing the Licanius Trilogy or Wheel of Time. 

I guess I just want to know that I'm not the only person feeling this. I would also love to know that there is an author out there who feels this and aims to make contributions in resolution of those feelings, but that might be too much to ask.",fantasy

Looking for fantasy guilds (that aren't thieves/adventurers),"I'm looking for fantasy books that revolve around trade guilds that *are not* thieves guilds or adventurers guilds or The Monarch's Mounted Messenger Service Who Are Also Diplomats/Spies.

I read [The Glasswrights' Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/720977.The_Glasswrights_Apprentice) by Mindy Klasky years ago and—though I'm not sure if it would still hold up to my taste overall now—I am looking for things like it that revolve around characters who are part of a trade guild. I really enjoy slow, character-driven fantasies that don't really spend time on battles. Guilds have that great structure of usually following one character (or a few) as they rise through the ranks, develop their trade or magic, and become involved in the internal power struggles of the guild itself or its relationship to the government of the world.

I've searched through some old threads here but most of what I see get recommended are thieves guilds (Locke Lamora, Shadowdance, etc). I just want less 'cool guy does heist murders' than what you'd normally get in a thieves guild story. In theory I'd enjoy a horse-riding messenger service guild but I've been disappointed by a few recently (Valdemar, The Green Rider) so trying to stay away from those as well.

Ash and sand trilogy - appreciation post and where to go from here?,"I finished reading the ""Ash and Sand"" trilogy about a month ago and have not been able to stop thinking about how good it was. It's very rare for me to fall in love with a character in a book and this book did that twice - once with Ruka, and again with Kale. 

The opening paragraph of the Kings of Paradise was interesting enough and it just kept getting better and better from there. I went from mild curiosity to absolutely loving the book about 20% of the way in. The pacing was perfect with lots of adrenaline pumping moments, incredible feats that left me absolutely thrilled, and the best part of all was the cool world building. 

I finished book 2 and 3 back to back, as fast as I could, I hated finishing it because that would mean it would end. 

I don't want to spoil anything to anyone so I won't go Into details, but I cannot stress on how much I enjoyed this book. Everything was perfect. Needless to say, this is my favourite book I read year. Possibly last year too. 

For those of you Sanderson fans out there, if you're familiar with the term Sanderlanche, I give you this: Ash and Sand has multiple multiple sanderlance-esque scenes scattered throughout the book! 

For those of you who hate Sanderson's books (I know there are a lot of you here), well, this book is packed full of moments that will leave your heart beating faster and your your soul wanting more of it. 

I picked up this book after I saw someone raving about it on this forum (thank you whoever you are - I thoroughly enjoyed it and glad I decided to listen to you). 

Now, I want more. I know there are a couple of books from Richard Nell on Goodreads and I will pick them up at some point, but, I want more books like this. Fantasy, epic world building, impossible odds, characters that I really like, a story I cannot put down. 

I've read almost everything by Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn FTW!), and the recent books I've loved include Kingdom of Grit, the whole thing by Michael J. Sullivan (Ryira chronicles and revelations), Green bone saga, Project hail Mary (yea this is sci-fi, and it totally had me hooked)...

"Holly Black's ""The Cruel Prince"" is very good.","Okay, I had low expectations about this book (because the less you expect, the more you can get) and I did not expect that I would like the book very much. 

In the world of the book, next to the human world, there is a fairy world hidden by fog. All sorts of magical creatures live in it. Some of them differ from people only in their ears, and some only remotely (or even not at all similar). 

I liked the world of this book. He is so magical, like in fairy tales, but at the same time so cruel (magic that allows you to control people's minds scares me in general). The author explains how that magic, or a magic item works very well.

In the story, Jude and her two sisters (one of whom is a fairy) live in a fairy world. The heroine wants to become a knight and performs in a tournament in front of the royals so that they accept her as a knight. One of them, Dain (the prince who is about to become king) secretly makes her his spy (because she knows how to lie, and fairies can't do that) and now she has to keep an eye on his brother Balekin, because it seems to him that he is planning to kill him. 

The book is divided into two parts: ""Book 1"" and ""Book 2"". And the plot focuses on Jude's life. About her conflicts with Cardan and his friends, about the relationship between her sisters and foster parents, and about her work as a spy. And it's done well. I couldn't tear myself away from the book because I was wondering what would happen next. The palace intrigues are done very well, and Chekhov's guns are firing.

About the characters. I like that most of them are not absolutely positive or negative characters. First, you root for this character, and then, learning something about him, you are ready to kill him, to put it mildly (&gt;!It's about you Locke!&lt;) or vice versa. 

Jude is smart, strong, stubborn, but at the same time she is impulsive, which is why she can commit an act after which she will regret having done it. 

Cardan (cruel prince) begins to play the main role only in ""Book 2"", but even so, he is not an interesting character. He's violent, but it's too much for him to kill someone. 

My favorite character is Madoc, Jude's stepfather. On the one hand, he is a cruel fairy who is known for the fact that war is the best entertainment for him, his military clothes have turned red, if not black with blood. Damn, the book starts with him killing Jude and Taryn's parents. But it is also clear that he is capable of love. He loves his daughters and son sincerely. He took care of them, taught them. But he is inherently cruel, no matter how much he loves someone.    

The author's writing style is good. It was easy to read and I like that when writing a book on behalf of Jude, the author does not often use the pronoun ""I"". Because of this, the book is more pleasant to read (at least for me it was). The descriptions are detailed and beautiful, especially the dresses. 

As a result, I liked the book. I can describe it as: ""A fairy tale for teenagers,"" because that's how it feels, a fairy tale. It has a good plot, characters, and writing style. This was the first book where I was interested in reading descriptions of dresses. I will read the sequels, because I wonder how the author will reveal the Cardan.",fantasy
Looking for books where characters deal with morality issues and learn to be better.,"Most times people say ""morally grey"" they end up meaning dark grey (so I guess I'm looking for light grey).

One example I really liked is Misaki in Sword of kaigen learning to just be a good mother.

The Witchwood Crown - frustrated with introductions,"I'm on page 109 and Williams is about to start me on yet another character's storyline. I've read The Dragonbone Chair series and I've read Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn and I don't remember either of those series beginning so tediously. 

I believe the series will be engaging at some point but I'm beginning to doubt my ability to reach that point. I'm disappointed and annoyed with the excessive # of storylines and how they've been thrown at me. There's the random female (faerie?) character thread, the king &amp; queen thread, the loser prince thread, the king&amp;queen's steward thread, the random male (faerie?) character thread, the faerie's human slave thread, the faerie building minister thread, some physically small character some the king's childhood thread, and this next chapter will be the faerie's human slave's child thread. 

I feel like the book so far has been written without any consideration for the reader. I'm frustrated. I want to feel engaged in this book series and I keep telling myself that I just need to get past the introductions, but they're endless. No sooner have I begun to feel like I could maybe become engaged in a particular character's story, that thread gets dropped and I'm forced to pick up a new one. 

I get that there can be a lot of characters needing introduced in a series and I know that Williams tends to be a multi-thread writer but this is poorly done. Mostly I just wanted to rant, but can anyone tell me if the story picks up soon? I'm praying that this slave child will be the final thread that gets dumped on me and I can start to enjoy some engaging storytelling. ",fantasy
Children of Virtue and Vengeance ,"So I am very picky about books that I read, especially in the fantasy genre, but I decided to pick up the first book to this trilogy. I finished it within a couple of days and immediately began reading this. I still have about a hundred or so pages left but I want to give my thoughts about this book, you're more than welcome to add on!

Pros: 
- This book really shows the heavy dynamic of human emotions and mental illnesses. Ptsd, childhood trauma, falling back into learned behaviors, anxieties, depression, doubt, trust, everything. It gives the book so much depth in my opinion
-character development and growth/decline. No one is perfect and there is insane ups and downs within this book, and even it's predecessor. I prefer books where the so-called ""chosen one"" isn't a perfect person
-we get to understand the thought process behind both sides of the war. Both people are fighting to live, although I sympathize with the magi more for obvious reasons. They are entirely valid in their anger 

Cons:
-both Amari and zelie are fucking dumb but you can see where their thought processes lie
-tzain rarely shows up except to comfort someone
-inan and his mother is weirdly close. Like I would think they were in a power imbalanced relationship if they weren't family. Also why is his mother's command over inan? That makes no sense to me

I am not a big fan of the book but I am dragging through so I can know what happens. Hopefully the third book will be better. What do yall think?",fantasy

"So, Assassin's Quest is pretty different to the others, yeah (spoilers ahead)","I'm about halfway through Assassin's Quest right now. I really enjoyed the previous two books, but I can't help but feel slightly disappointed in the change of structure.

Before, it was Fitz running about as he is constantly put on these impossible situations, juggling his relationship with everyone around him. Big fan, some stuff I didn't love but the end to Royal Assassin was excellent 

But AQ... Idk. So far, very few of the previous characters. And Fitz is like, completely useless. So far the book is extremely repetitive. Fitz meets a new gang, chills for a while, then they get attacked and leave. 9/10 times Fitz himself doesn't actually do anything but fail and get rescued. I'm not sure I can take another sequence where someone learns who he is, betrays him, he is tortured to near death but then someone comes miraculously out of nowhere to save the day

I get this seems to be a lot of the point. He felt alone before but without that support he's really struggling, but this boy seems USELESS to the point of agony, especially because the book is so damn repetitive. It's basically the same setup every time, with no major recurring characters.

Doesn't help that every challenge is so monotonous, it's like chores, small problems about crossing a river or buying beer in a tavern.

Please tell me, it sort of rights itself eventually / is worth it, because I'm starting to really lose patience.

Just to confirm, my issue isn't the change of structure, or the failure, it's the constant repetition while Fitz seemingly learns nothing and has no good ideas",fantasy

Neil Gaiman does this. It’s been a while since I’ve read “Alice In Wonderland” but iirc, Carroll does so as well. Most famously, and dialed to the nth degree, of course, would be Lemony Snicket of the “Series of Unfortunate Events” books.

Best good to evil arc in fantasy?,"**Note: Reposted as I used some terminology wrong...**


Redemption arcs are super popular in all literature, but I'm looking for the opposite.

I'm talking about books where there are proper arcs of good people going a dark road ending up in a place where they can't be redeemed. This doesn't mean people who just went down a path of villainy, but people who are good and have good intentions taking the wrong turn. 

The closest examples I can think of are &gt;!Nathair in The Faithful and the Fallen!&lt; or &gt;!Konrad Vonvalt in Empire of the Wolf!&lt;.

To be clear I want to avoid cases where people are corrupted by supernatural influence like &gt;!Smeagol by The One Ring!&lt;.

This can be main or periphery characters, since I get that most people don't like their protagonist going from good to bad. So hit me with any recommendations and naturally given the topic please use spoilers liberally!",fantasy
Simple Fantasy Recommendations,"Im pretty new to fantasy. I started a few years back with Lies of Locke Lamora, really enjoyed it. I'm currently halfway through Red Seas Under Red Skies and I've enjoyed it so far, but im looking for something different for my next read.

I'm looking to read a book thats focused on a quest or some kind of adventure, with really powerfull characters (just like Locke and Jean). So my focus on my next read would be a nice story with nice characters, that give that sense of wonder and adventure. Im not trying to focus that much on complex magic systems and things like that, the focus is more on story and characters.

I would hope that you all have some recommendations Note: Preferably standalone books or trilogies, not a really long series.",fantasy
Read the First Book in Jack Vance Dying Earth Series...meh! ,"Was eager to check out Jack Vances Dying Earth stories since so many people sing their praises. I read the first book in the series and was underwhelmed.

A loosely connected set of short stories set on a far future earth where the Sun is a faded red giant and magic and science are indistinguishable. This is a world in its last throes but other than the setting not much else is shared between each story.

The stories go nowhere, whilst having some interesting ideas each story ends abruptly. I kept expecting a conclusion in following tales, alas these stories stand alone.

Other than some interesting ideas rendered with lyrical purple prose and a fascinating mix of science &amp; fantasy there isn't much to see here. For me the stories end before they get going, I found myself caring little about the events or the characters for that matter.

Tanith Lee did it better with Nights Master from her Flat Earth Series which was in part inspired by Vances Dying Earth. Tanith Lee does a better job with this format of story telling. The interlocking stories set in the same universe are mythic, well plotted and characterised. Tanith Lee's writing is poetic, evocative and lends an air of mystery that is lacking in this first entry of Vances Dying Earth stories.

I have heard that the following books in the series improve over this first entry. I think based on the ideas here alone Vance is worth a second look. I was really digging the science fantasy mash up and I can see that he had a powerful &amp; idiomatic imagination I just hope for better story telling in the future books I try.",fantasy

Question about Locke Lamora,"So I got about halfway thru, loved it, Skyrim thieves guild vibes and super fun read. I was honestly really enjoying it but something kept nagging at me and was ultimately the reason I DNF’d because I couldn’t fully buy in knowing this fact, and was hoping for a discussion to dissect this choice. Apologies for not using the right terms for things from the book, it’s been a little while. 

So if I understand correctly, there is a sort of rule in place by the mob bosses where thieves can’t steal from rich people/government people/ people like that? To me, that makes absolutely no sense. Did I miss an explanation where the mob bosses are in bed with the rich people? And I assume the second half of the book is Locke and freinds dismantling the current order? 

It all makes for great setup but I just can’t buy that the big mob bosses would ever agree to that in the first place. Or that the rich people would make that deal with the mob bosses. Please educate me. ",fantasy
"My new dark Norse fantasy, Skadi's Saga, is live! (Audiobook giveaway)","https://preview.redd.it/9ihihvdbimod1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=318a2ac1887a7a7e0c64bd280a3b94221b0d7364

Hello !

My latest series Skadi's Saga has kicked off this month with [The Hall of the Jotunn Queen](https://www.amazon.com/Hall-Jotunn-Queen-Skadis-Saga-ebook/dp/B0DGV61Y95), a literary dark fantasy set in a Norse inspired world.

&gt;**Death was only the beginning.**

&gt;Skadi's world is shattered when an empire razes her home. Fleeing to her uncle's remote stronghold on the dreaded Draugr Coast, she vows to become a shieldmaiden and avenge her kin. But there's a truth she keeps hidden: she has already died once, only to be resurrected by a cruel goddess, and gifted with the power to weave fate itself.

&gt;Amidst a landscape where carnivorous mermaids lurk in icy waters, undead haunt the mist-laden mountains, and gods walk among mortals, Skadi's quest for vengeance unfolds. The Hall of the Jotunn Queen is a fierce saga of revenge, rebirth, and the brutal beauty of Norse myth.

**Novel Background:** In writing this I did a deep dive into the Eddas, Odin's words of wisdom in the Hávamál, The Sagas of the Icelanders, numerous popular nonfiction books like Children of Ash and Elm, Beowulf, more scholarly works like The Viking Way: Magic and Mind in Late Iron Age Scandinavia, along with various podcasts and dozens more texts. Then I took all that atmosphere and violence and beauty and tried to channel it into a world of my own creation, striving to remain true to the spirit of the Norse world while injecting it with all monsters, mystery, wonder, and horror of the tales.

(Extra cool: the [audiobook is narrated by the incredible Nina Yndis](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Hall-of-the-Jotunn-Queen-Audiobook/B0CH3S36QV) of Peaky Blinders and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla fame, and her Scandinavian accent truly brings this tale to life.)

The sequel, [The Crimson Tree of Kaldrborg](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DDLH8683), will be dropping in November, so there won't be a long wait for more of Skadi's adventures if you enjoy this first serving.

"Bingo Reviews: Strange Beasts of China, How High We Go In The Dark, Nimona, The Cat Who Saved Books, Stone Blind","Note: I'm trying to mark every prompt each book counts for and whether or not it's hard mode, but I can't guarantee I didn't miss something. This is books 6-10 of my picks this year.

***Strange Beasts of China*** **by Yan Ge**

4.5 stars

Counts for: Eldritch Beings (hm), Dreams (hm), Entitled Animals (I would argue this is hm since the ""strange beasts"" are magical), Author of Color, Under the Surface, Prologues and Epilogues

How can I describe this book? It thoroughly confused me, and yet, I adored it.

This book is intensely atmospheric, melancholy, bittersweet, and fascinating. In a lot of ways it reminded me of one of my favorite lesser-known gems, Ursula K. Leguin's *Changing Planes*. Each chapter in *Strange Beast of China* begins with an anthropological description of a ""strange beast"" living in the modern city of Yong'an. It then describes a time the narrator interacted with this beast while trying to untangle her difficult past, before concluding with a revised and often more unsettling description of the beast based on what the narrator has learned. 

Due to the author's minimalism when it comes to sharing her protagonist's thoughts, there were multiple times I was left struggling to understand what realizations or conclusions the character was acting on. Even so, this is probably my favorite book so far this year. The author's unique voice and fascinating worldbuilding carried me through the bits I wasn't quite following, and it's important to note that the parts that confused me did nothing to prevent me from understanding or being deeply satisfied by the ending. I would recommend this for readers who enjoy works more dependent on character and world than on plot, and for anyone who wants to read a beautifully written piece of magical realism about the line between humanity and the Other.

***How High We Go In The Dark*** **by Sequoia Nagamatsu**

3 stars

Counts for: Survival, Author of Color, Multi POV (hm), Prologues and Epilogues

If this novel had been a short story, I would have given it five stars. The prose is excellent, and the theme of coping with impending loss that you can't do anything about is handled in a mature and moving way. There's a lot to praise here. 

However, it didn't prove satisfying as a novel to me. The story of a world-wide pandemic is told through a series of characters so similar, in every way from demographics to family dynamics to their obsession with 80's pop music, that it prevents the novel from feeling like it told a truly global story. And while new and interesting set dressing appears in each chapter, the overall arc and tone of each mini-story is similar enough that it quickly becomes repetitive.

There are also two chapters which diverge from this mold and have the opposite problem, presenting ideas so disconnected to the rest of the book that it feels like they should be their own novels. In particular the final chapter feels out of left field and seems to undercut some of what came before. I do think this book is worth reading for its prose and character work, but I'd recommend looking at it more like a series of meditations on a theme than a novel. It just didn't quite come together.  

***Nimona*** **by ND Stevenson**

3.5 stars

Counts for: Criminals (hm), Character With a Disability (hm)

This webcomic-turned-graphic-novel-turned-Netflix-movie has great humor, great action sequences, and a lot to say on subjects like trauma and trust. Yet despite that, it left me feeling kind of… meh. It's fine I guess? It's a great example of the ""grumpy badass loner adopts murderbaby"" trope, and takes some time to deconstruct a few other popular tropes along the way. I'm not sure what made this just good instead of great for me, but if I had to guess I'd say the story got away from the author a bit. There are big themes being tackled, like how hurt people hurt people and when it is or isn't justifiable to kill, and overall the second half may not be quite as well executed as the beginning. 

I also have to note, as someone coming to this as a fan of N.D. Stevenson and the Netflix adaptation, that finding the the same-sex romance relegated to subtext took me by surprise and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Although I do like that Ambrosius was allowed to be a much more morally grey character in the comic. I think fans of the movie would want to know that this is a case of an adaptation so different from the source material that they're best considered different stories. 

**The Cat Who Saved Books, by Sosuke Natsukawa**

1 star

Counts For: Entitled Animals, Author of Color

It's taken me a long time to pare this down into a review instead of a rant. I very, very rarely rate things one star, but I really couldn't find anything to praise in this short novel.

This book markets itself as whimsical and heartwarming. It is not. It is a 200 page combined rant and lecture on what people ought to read, and how they ought to read it, and how nobody publishes good books anymore. I'll spare you the examples I kept trying to cram into my earlier reviews; just know that I found the only escape from the overwhelming pretentiousness to be the occasional bouts of sexism. 

Ironically, a good portion of the text is spent describing the unspeakable horror that is ""books which only have information or entertainment,"" and encouraging the reader to exclusively read books that are too difficult for them. So by all accounts, the author agrees with me that you should really skip his book. 

One more gripe aside from the general tone: despite name-dropping a seemingly endless number of Real Books™, only a single recommended title originated outside of Europe or North America. The majority seemed to come from Enlightenment-era France and England. I would have loved to come away from this having learned something, anything, about the literature of the culture it takes place in (Japan). But hey, I did learn that you can determine if a person is worth talking to by asking if they've read *Candide*… so I guess that's something?

In conclusion, the only part of this book I enjoyed was the sentence that read ""they crossed the flagstones and took off their shoes,"" because ""they"" refers to a boy and a cat. I like to imagine the aloof feline guide is wearing little kitty booties the whole time.

***Stone Blind*** **by Natalie Haynes**

4 stars

Counts for: Multi POV (hm), Under the Surface

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it won me over. For me the selling point for *Stone Blind* is not the story itself, but rather the way in which that story is told. This is, by the way, an *excellent* pick for Multi POV, with everyone from famous gods to minor characters to a grove of olive trees taking a turn at the narration. The wide variety of perspectives and opinions adds interest to a story the reader is likely at least somewhat familiar with (the tale of Perseus and Medusa). Furthermore, the way the assembled chorus of voices occasionally wanders into associated myths or takes you to different chronological points gives the reader insight into one of the novel's key assertions, that the non-human characters are not experiencing time the same way humans are. 

The reason I was skeptical of this book is that I dislike the tendency of mythical retellings to downplay, justify, or otherwise change aspects of the myths that don't sit well with modern readers. I have to admit that *Stone Blind* is not completely free of this. That said, it takes a refreshingly frank approach to most of the disturbing aspects of Greek mythology, and even engages in some tongue-in-cheek humor regarding the gods' understanding of their own behavior. All in all, this was a quick and refreshing read.",fantasy

[Audiobook Review] Soul Relic by Samuel Hinton - LitRPG coming of age,"https://preview.redd.it/e9bxkoj09mod1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dbb3ed5b41c9fd2a3888381da5e903666ebeba3

[https://beforewegoblog.com/audiobook-review-soul-relic-by-samuel-hinton/](https://beforewegoblog.com/audiobook-review-soul-relic-by-samuel-hinton/)

SOUL RELIC by Samuel Hinton and narrated by Andrea Emmes is a cultivation fantasy, which is a burgeoning genre that basically means developing your elemental powers along very Eastern martial arts principles. The fantasy world the author has created isn’t necessarily any more Asian than Avatar: The Last Airbender but that doesn’t mean it’s not squarely in the genre either. It is something that I think would appeal to both fantasy as well as sports fans.

The premise is that in this world, it is possible to become trained as an aeon-wielder or elemental magician. Raysha is a village girl who was born with a lot of aeon in her reserves but no way to naturally replenish it. This is actually a fairly serious disadvantage and she is denied a chance at university after finally managing to escape her home. Her brother, Vashi, is determined to help her as well even if it means teaming up with an old archaeologist, Hlaya, to explore ruins of a civilization that once had to deal with people like Raysha.

This is very much a classic coming of age journey but is made all the more interesting because of the fact that Raysha and company are fairly out of the larger politics at work. The God of Knowledge has just slaughtered all of the other gods in the region in a coup but none of this is a concern of Rasyha. She has her own problems to deal with that don’t allow her to even think of such bigger deals.

I really liked this story and the characters involved, Raysha is an adorable heroine who may be a bit whiny about her status but quickly won me over with her snarky can-do attitude. I also liked the supporting cast and am interested in seeing where this story goes. Vashi, Hllaya, and Ocatvian are all a good cast of characters for supporting Raysha and keep her attitude from getting too insufferable.

I found the magic system to be well-designed and the writing to be entertaining throughout. I liked how our heroes also came into the sights of the Big Bad. Too often, it’s destiny or contrived but, no, our heroes ended up killing some of his minions in an encounter and things just sort of snowball from there. I really like that.

The narrator does a decent job of representing Raysha and the various characters. Andrea Emmes manages to do also convey the danger as well as inner resentment the character is suffering. I’m eager to listen to the next book in the series. I recommend the audiobook over the text version in fact because I feel she did such an excellent job.",fantasy

One Mike to Read Them All: “Long Live Evil” by Sarah Rees Brennan,"This is the 3rd book I have read recently from the perspective of the villain - not antihero, not a book with no real heroes, but explicitly the *villain*. Protagonist, but still the villain of the story. [*Dreadful* by Caitlin Rozakis](https://reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1c7gmvp/one_mike_to_read_them_all_advance_review_of/) was a farce; [*How to Become the Dark Lord &amp; Die Trying* by Django Wexler](https://reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1c1lo5a/one_mike_to_read_them_all_advance_review_of_how/) was a satire. This book was deadly serious.

Our main character is Rae. She’s 20 years old, and dying of leukemia. Her main comfort is her kid sister, and their mutual love of the “Time of Iron” book series. (As an aside, I’m curious to hear from someone who’s read both this and Sarah J. Maas. I haven’t read any of Maas’ stuff, but from what I know of it I suspect there was a lot of inspiration drawn from there. I also see a lot of Bella Swan in the book-in-a-book’s heroine Lia.) She’s visited at the hospital by a mysterious woman, who tells her that the doctors will soon tell her that her cancer has gotten worse, and her slight chance of survival has turned to no chance at all. But this woman offers an improbable chance; she will send her to the universe of the Time of Iron, and if she’s able to pluck a magical flower from the king’s greenhouses (an element of the books known to Rae) she will return to the real world and recover. Rae is suspicious, but naturally, but willing to take any chance. She finds herself in the cartoonishly-curvaceous body of the lascivious Lady Rahaela, also known as the Beauty Dipped in Blood, wicked stepsister to the good and pure heroine Lia, the night before Lady Rahaela is to be horribly executed at the end of the first book. But Rae is undaunted. She is determined, has nothing to lose, and knows how the story goes. She was put into the body of a villain, so a villain she shall be. Villains get to have more fun, after all.

Rae is a very angry person. She’s angry at her own body for failing her. She’s angry that she can’t be the protective older sister she used to be. She’s angry that her friends and boyfriend would complain about how *hard* her illness was on *them* until they abandoned her (and her best friend and ex boyfriend hooked up soon after). She’s angry at her dad for ditching the family soon after she was diagnosed, she’s angry at her mom whom she never sees because she is always working to pay Rae’s medical bills, she’s angry that she’s dying before she really got the chance to live. And now she’s dropped into the body of a villainess, with a fundamentally selfish (if entirely understandable) goal, in a world she considers fictional surrounded by people she doesn’t think of as real. So, yeah, she’s quite happy to be a villainess.

But things are not quite so simple, for lots of reasons. Her conviction that none of the people around her are real wears thin very quickly; she tries to tell herself it’s the case long after she should have realized otherwise. She doesn’t know the books as well as she thinks she does - she had a tendency to zone out during the “boring” parts. And in any case the [Laws of Narrative Causality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality) don’t hold as strongly as she thinks they do.

Leigh Burdago’s cover blurb called this “audacious,” and that’s a good word for it. I am looking forward to the sequel.

Series Review: The Demon Cycle by Peter Brett,"**Review/rant of the series - Spoiler Warning: Unfulfilled potential and flat finale, unfortunately.**

**TLDR: Key characters with a lot of character development are under utilised and the ending is rushed and underwhelming. SA is poorly navigated and pacing is disjointed with the series losing is identity. But the world building and character development is great. Try it.**

I finished The Core some time back and I've had time to digest and reflect on this series. Let me start out by saying, I have a lot of love for this series which is probably why I am even taking the time to write this review. Peter Brett's world building skills are immaculate and I found myself completely immersed in Thesa and the social dynamics of every culture that was touched upon. You can see the sentimentality of the author in particular when it comes to the relationships between characters - while it did not always land, for the most part Peter Brett creates strong bonds and emotion between characters and he is a sucker for a good reunion, which I personally quite enjoy. The first two books of the series are without question the strongest. Books 3-5 are much more up for debate - people tend to categorically say that book 3 is BAD and so on. I think there was a lot to like in books 3 &amp; 4 however the criticism is valid in terms of pacing. Personally I really enjoyed the in depth look at Inevera and her back story in book 3. Book 5 was by far the weakest and really it can be said that in the final two books of the series, the saga really lost some of it's identity and was diluted by the over abundance of POVs and side stories. On the positives, I really loved how Peter Brett built the environments - the politics of the free cities in contrast to the struggles of the hamlets and towns. The Krasians were by far the most interesting group of people and I loved the political intrigue and navigation of social constructs within the culture which made for some of the more compelling writing. The lifting of real world cultures is a bit on the nose, you can see how heavily inspired Peter Brett is by Arabic/Islamic culture when writing about the Krasians (although the author claims there were different inspirations). At first this rubbed me the wrong way as in book 1 the Krasians are portrayed as a backwards, backstabbing society that almost came across as political propaganda to me. Book 2 recovers this as it shows a completely different side to the Krasians and as the series develops it becomes clear that each society has their viewpoint and nobody is really ""correct"", with deep flaws in each society. This balance is actually conveyed quite well - it is not as simple as to just categorise Jardir as a ""religious fanatic"" which I saw many readers do probably from a more westernised view of the world.

So why 3 stars and the title? The series is deeply flawed in my opinion and it pains me to say it. My frustration with this series comes from the lack of pay off to so much character building and development. Peter Brett does such a good job at lifting characters to show that they are big players in this world - Leesha, Amanvah, Abban, Ashia, even Gared. I list these characters because they had significant focus on their stories to the point where you feel like they have been developed so far that they have to play a significant part in the overarching narrative (applies less to Leesha and Abban who are main characters anyway). But they end up have such moot finales it's really quite frustrating.

Leesha after all her development and story and all these skills she picks up - she marches to Angiers to regain control. That's it, that is the climax of her story. She has no part to play in the ending of Sharak Ka, her role was to resolve a side result of Sharak Ka, which was the fall of Angiers. Also for a big part of the series, she gets reduced to just her love life and pregnancy. She is the herb gatherer and ruler of the Hollow. She's unlocked the secrets of the Dama'ting and can fuck up demons just as easily as Arlen and Jardir. Yet after swiftly moving on from her SA (we will get to that later), she basically chases or gets chased by several men, get's pregnant and then the only focus is her trying to hide it. She could have been so much more.

Amanvah seemed like such a big player and she grew in significance while she was in Cutters Hollow with Rojer and Sikvah. You think, especially after Rojer's death that she will have some kind way to leave a mark on the story. - she goes back home to be a Damaji'ting, the end.

With Abban there was this whole prophecy of the dice that he is pivotal to victory in Sharak Ka. He gets tortured for the entirety of book 5 and then get's rescued by Ashia and helps to kill a mind demon for his escape. How did this help win Sharak Ka? And all of a sudden he had the strength to battle wills with a mind demon with no build up or suggestion he could do this unless the torture was meant to harden him? The book does not allude to any of it. There was this whole thing about how Inevera's fate is tied to Abban's and vice versa. What happened with that? Inevera seemed to be doing pretty well, meanwhile Abban was having his dong cut off and tortured repeatedly by Hasik.

Gared &amp; Wonda march to Angiers with Leesha. They had so much development, I was so ready for at least one of them to go out in a blaze of glory but they did next to nothing and played no part in the overall story of Sharak Ka.

Ashia was pretty cool, she developed into this badass Sharum'ting and then got thrown into this quickly put together side story with Briar and Abban. Her story in Everam's Bounty was interesting, navigating Asome &amp; Asukaji as well as her training with Enkido. What did it serve in the end? She saved Abban and went home?

Asome has no redemption arc, he just gets scared by Jardir and falls in line. After all that plotting and planning and all that tension about succession with Jayan (Jayan's ending was pretty cool though).

Even Inevera - the freaking DAMAJAH. You would think she would be like front and centre with Jardir and Arlen. Ok she becomes the defacto ruler of Krasia in Jardir's absence but her finale is her going to Lakton and helping out. It's definitely cool that she goes there and stabilises the region but as a finale it is so tame for her. She needed her moment, especially after she was undermined and almost killed by Melan and Asavi.

It is frustrating how under utilised these characters are in the finale when, did Shanjat &amp; Shanvah really need to be there? Any of the above could have been there instead and would have made their deaths so much more impactful. Did anyone care when Shanjat and Shanvah died? Did Ragen and Elissa really need to be the front and centre of the defence of Miln? I love them as characters but we left them behind in book 1 I think. Imagine Gared/Wonda/Leesha for example being in Miln instead under real jeopardy.

So those are the characters I think had a great injustice on them in this story.

Let's talk about Arlen and Jardir.

Not going to lie, I love Jardir. The man is the definition of aura. I think he has to be one of my favourite characters in a book series but I wish Peter Brett would tone down his inability to resist women. I don't mind seeing him act as a human and not always in this Shar'dama Ka persona but I think at times it did detract from him as a character. On the whole though, I'm pretty happy with Jardir and his story and I'm glad he makes it out the other side (we'll get to that later). At times in the last book he seems almost out of his depths compared to Arlen, which sure in a way makes sense because Arlen is almost like hybrid demon. But he is Shar'dama Ka, leader of Krasia, I think his power with the spear and crown should have been ramped up by 100. He seemed too mortal compared to the others but maybe that was the idea.

Arlen....so great in the first two books and then he just gets so annoying and boring. He becomes this walking cliche of high horse spiel about morals that becomes so tiresome. I get it that he is meant to be the guy with the (mostly) clean conscience. The one you are ""supposed"" to root for and align with but I just found him down right unlikable at times. When Arlen was alone and working towards a goal he is actually a great character to follow but around other characters he tends to just become this generic alpha male which is so off putting. His ending was about what I expected, I'm not sure what the author could have done differently in that aspect, one of Jardir or Arlen had to go in the end and it seemed like the obvious choice for it to be Arlen

Renna is jarring and I think a lot of readers echo that sentiment. It feels like she was forced back into the story to throw people off the expected outcome of Arlen and Leesha. I'm not mad that Arlen and Leesha don't get together, I actually think Jardir and Leesha have better chemistry. But Arlen and Renna is just corny and Renna in general is just this quickly over powered, rash character which proves to be somewhat of a distraction. I found myself disappointed whenever she would appear in a scene but I did like how she started to build a relationship with Shanvah (rest in pieces).

Some other elements to consider - I have noticed that Peter Brett has a tendency to have a whole lot of nothing happening for pages and then in a couple of paragraphs so much happens that it feels rushed. It's like pages of posturing and scene setting and then suddenly two people are dead and a major plot point uncovered in a paragraph. More time on these key events would be much better.

Peter Brett's navigation of SA is a difficult topic and one that has been raised by many readers. It's argued that is a reflection of the barbarity of the world that was built but the way characters respond to it and the frequency of occurrence is something that bothered me. I was able to look past this and continue with the series but that may be me speaking from a place of male privilege. Men are SA'd too in this book and regardless of the gender of the victim, it seems to be brushed over in the most nonsensical manner.

The series ends with everyone drinking and dining together and again this felt rushed and a bit disjointed. Given the nature of the political intrigue and complexities of society and relationships between characters - the book deserved a few more chapters at the end of Sharak Ka to adequately portray the political aftermath. Let Jardir rule his subjects and bring back stability to Krasia, let Leesha and Ragen stabilise the free cities and in doing so unite Thesa. How does the world respond to the loss of Arlen Bales? How does the world respond to the demons being gone? Did Tibbets Brook survive the swarm? What happens to Asome? There were a lot of things that could have been fleshed out.

So it is a long review and filled with a lot of criticism. It is criticism that comes from my love of the series on a whole and I wish it focused more on these areas I felt were lacking. Should you read the book? I would still say yes. The characters and world on the whole are beautifully written and immersing. Just be prepared for an anticlimactic ending and for many character's stories to fizzle out in the end.",fantasy
Middle-Earth Reading Order,"So, as the title suggests, I'm trying to piece together a complete guide to all of Tolkien's Middle-Earth texts; could very much use some input and/or suggestions! All of the ones I find online seem to be just a very basic outline with only the obvious main entries, I'm looking for more of a complete list. Here's what I have so far:

* The Hobbit
* The Fellowship of the Ring
* The Two Towers
* The Return of the King
* The Adventures of Tom Bombadil
* The Silmarillion
* The Lord of the Rings
* Bilbo’s Last Song
* Unfinished Tales of Númenor &amp; Middle-Earth
* The History of the Hobbit
* The Book of Lost Tales (Part I)
* The Book of Lost Tales (Part II)
* The Lays of Beleriand
* The Shaping of Middle-Earth
* The Lost Road
* The Return of the Shadow
* The Treason of Isengard
* The War of the Ring
* Sauron Defeated: The End of the Third Age
* Morgoth’s Ring
* The War of the Jewels
* The Peoples of Middle-Earth
* The Children of Húrin
* Beren and Lúthien
* The Fall of Gondolin
* The Nature of Middle-Earth
* The Fall of Númenor

Open to additions (if I missed anything), subtractions (if something is superfluous), and, obviously, changes in the order. Also, aware I kind of put the LOTR twice.. but I thought maybe it could be a nice refresher after the Silmarillion and before The History of Middle-Earth? May be unnecessary though, again, open to thoughts. Also in question is the placement of The History of The Hobbit; wasn’t sure if publication date would make more sense (after the original History) or if it would fit nicely after Unfinished Tales and before the original History. Thanks! Looking forward to the discussion :)",fantasy

How to encourage someone out of a book slump?,"Hubby deals with depression daily, he's an avid fantasy reader who has gotten me into many of my favourite authors. Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman.

Convince my Dad to return to Fantasy,"My love for reading comes from my father. He read to me every night when I was younger, working our way through Dick King Smith, Roald Dahl, Harry Potter, and Deltora Quest (let me know if you've read this series). 

When he was in his late 20s he read the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. He regularly talks about this series to this day. The only other fantasy series he has read is Harry Potter, which he read by himself whilst also reading it to me as he was hooked by the story line and needed to RAFO quicker than the pace of my bedtime stories. Since then he has predominately read thrillers; Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Cormoran Strike, Amos Decker, and Robert Langdon. 

I would love for him to return to fantasy so we can share our reading experience again. I intend to read the Thomas Covenant series to help with this.

Please give me some suggestions as well as the pitch in order to convince him. He would enjoy fast-paced, high action books that are character driven and contain plot twists. 

**Ideally some recommendations that aren't Mistborn. I know the second book would put him off due to it's sluggish pace and** &gt;!**focus on Elend's and Vin's juvenile relationship.**!&lt;

Books like Game of Thrones but not as dark?,"
Hi 👋 Could any of you help me find books that have multiple story lines that intertwine like game of thrones but not as dark or grotesque? 

I’m on the 5th book and in between the books I’ve been watching the shows that’s supposed to go along with it. And I just watched the scene where Sansa got (kind of) raped by Ramsey. I don’t think I can take it anymore 😢 That poor little girl 🥺 I don’t have to read that on the book. It will feel more real to read than to watch for me.

Had mixed feelings about Lions of Al-Rassan. Should I continue with GGK's works?,"On paper, Guy Gavriel Kay's works sounds incredibly appealing to me, as a fan of both fantasy and historical fiction. And indeed, there's lots to like about Lions. Its thorough grounding in history creates a sense of verisimilitude that immerses me into the world even more than the far out settings of many epic fantasies. The characters are interesting, the themes and ideas are thought-provoking, and the prose flows nicely. On the other hand, the book is the only one in recent memory that had me so mad I almost wanted to throw it across the room. It's been a few months since I finished the book and I may not recall things perfectly, so bear with me.

Though his prose is smooth and lyrical, a nice change of pace from the more utilitarian writing of many modern fantasies, I felt that it was far too oversentimental and overdramatic at times, and (to be honest) rather cheesy. Moments that would have read fine in their own right are embellished with so much exaggerated flourish that I found myself rolling my eyes not infrequently. Instead of arising naturally out of the characters and their development, the plot, the circumstances, the writing is so blunt and in-your-face that these moments instead feel forced and unearned, suppressing the emotions they are trying to incite in the first place. I guess this can be chalked up to stylistic preferences though; I've read a couple of reviews, and I know people have cried at scenes I cringed at.

Regardless, analogous to his prose, his characters feel... overly perfect. Actually, I'm not sure if that's the right word. They're not perfect people, certainly. They make mistakes; they have flaws... somewhat. But there's an ethereal quality to them that makes them (and by *them* I primarily mean the main cast of Jehane, Ammar, and Rodrigo) not feel at all like real people. They're too romantic, too heroic, as if they were the leads of a blockbuster action film or something rather than an ostensibly grounded historical narrative. They also feel somewhat anachronistic in terms of their mindset and psychology, as if they were twenty-first century people supplanted into this pre-modern setting. I couldn't get into them as characters. I can't get into the specifics here since I can't remember all the details -- the broad strokes of my feelings here are all I remember.

Despite the somewhat plodding pace, I still felt as if we didn't spend enough time to truly get to know these characters; instead we are transported to the minds of tertiary characters of little importance, like that Belmonte priest whose name I can't recall, or the queen's lover. I also really disliked the sudden out-of-nowhere romance between our two main leads. I felt it was out of place, cheesy, and contrived.

And, finally, one of the most frustrating things is Kay's use of, *in my opinion*, cheap tricks to artificially create tension and emotions. For this one I *can* get into the specifics, though again I may not be recalling things clearly. The gist of it is that, in certain key scenes, Kay would deliberately obfuscate information from the reader by omitting names or keeping things vague in the narrative so you weren't sure what was happening to what character. He would at times heavily imply that our beloved main characters were in danger, only to finally reveal in the end what *actually* happened -- which is usually not as exciting as what was implied to have happened. It's hard to show how egregious this is without getting into spoilers.

&gt;!I remember one scene where (I think) Ammar is implied to be in danger and dying, which was the first time I felt any real emotion during reading this, only for it to be revealed that Ammar is safe after all and it's actually this other guy that died (I think it was Jehane's servant?). !&lt;Kay does this multiple times throughout the book, undercutting the emotional resonance these moments would have naturally produced, instead making the reader (or me, at least) feel relieved that what was implied to have happened didn't actually happen, and feel intensely annoyed and cheated at the author for the misdirection.

Despite these misgivings, I still really want to get into GGK's works. *Lions* and his stellar essay on writing [historical fantasy](https://brightweavings.com/globe/) has convinced me of his pseudo-historical approach, and inspired me immensely as an aspiring writer who wants to straddle the two genres. But if all his books are written in this way, I don't think I would enjoy them very much. *Lions* took me far longer to read than something like Shogun or Lonesome Dove, for instance, far more expansive and sprawling works that have (I'm pretty sure) thrice as many words. I only finished it because of the respect I have for GGK after what I've read of him online.

Should I continue with his works, and if so, which would you recommend?",fantasy

Aphantasia when it comes to characters,"I have aphantasia (meaning I cannot conjure or see any images in my brain at all). So I always really struggle with characters and how they physically present and often I have to look up fan art to get some sort of picture of a character. However, there are times, when I read a character and my brain will automatically Rolodex through anything I have seen historically and decide what that character looks like (it’s not a picture in my brain more like I am reminded of a character and brain just assigns that look to them so to say, it’s hard to explain). 

Well, I am 1/3 through the second book of the To Bleed A Crystal Bloom series and my brain has decided that Cainon is Commodore Norrington from Pirates of the Caribbean. I haven’t watched those movies in over a decade but my brain has decided that is what he looks like 😂 anyone else have this happen to them? 

Some honorable mentions when this has happened: 
- Tairn (Fourth Wing) my brain has decided is Hathi Jr from Jungle Book
- Lehabah (CC) my brain has decided is Sally Nightmare Before Christmas 
- Princess Lira (To Kill A Kingdom) my brain has decided is one of the merpeople from the HO movie series 
- Cardan (Cruel Prince) my brain has decided is Billie Joe Armstrong 

Honestly, there’s no rhyme or reason. I truly think my brain spins the Rolodex and just picks someone. The problem is, once it happens and my brain selects a character I have seen before I can never undo it 😂 so I guess Cainon will always be Commodore Norrington.

"Favorite ""coalition-building"" adventure?","By coalition-building, I mean a cast of protagonists from a wide range of backgrounds (especially ones that would normally be at odds with each other) all working together for some greater good. Lord of the Rings is probably the most iconic example - elves, dwarves, men, and hobbits all teaming up with a wizard to take a ring into a mountain - but it doesn't scratch that itch for me because they spend very little time actually together, and because it doesn't do enough to highlight the differences that make them stronger together. I won't comment on the extent to which it's held up over the years, but what I remember of David Eddings had some of this, which is I think a big part of what I liked about his writing as a kid.

I think my favorite example of this is probably Avatar: The Last Airbender. Part of what makes it especially powerful is the fact that one character ""betrays"" their country in order to do the right thing. That element of character growth and/or self-sacrifice for a higher purpose is what I love most about these kinds of stories; it doesn't necessarily have to be a ""villain"" joining the good guys, but someone working against the grain and working with people that all evidence says they should be butting heads with is absolutely peak for me.",fantasy
Whatever happened to subtext in fantasy? ,"Recently finished Jade City after someone sold it to me as a well-written character work, but I was frustrated by the writing style. Certain scenes could stand well on its own, only to be followed by an explanation of what had just occured by the author. In fact, the author is so obsessed with info dumping, it prevents the readers from forming their own conclusion. This type of writing frustrates me, because there is little nuance in character work, and the whole book feels like a textbook, rather than a story. 

Sanderson and RF Kuang's books are also guilty of this. (I tried so hard to like Babel but the footnotes were so unnecessary and only served to remind the readers that colonialism is bad just in case we forgot.)

I would like it if authors does character work without having the need to spell out the most obvious things. i feel like certain scenes are more powerful if they're left on their own without the author constantly intervening in the narrative. Authors that let you live the moment without having to explain things constantly.  That's why I loved Kazuo Ishiguro's works. So if there is anyone who can do subtle characterization like that author, please do let me know :)",fantasy

Revisiting Classics - The Cold Equations (1954) by Tom Godwin,"https://beforewegoblog.com/revisiting-classics-the-cold-equations-by-tom-godwin/

The Cold Equations by Tom Godwin shares much in common with the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and The First Law Trilogy in that there are elements of all three that are designed to piss the reader off. I also point out that it is because of these elements that it is a classic story. In the case of The Cold Equations, it is the ending. Generations of science fiction fans have been pissed off by the ending. It has been debated as contrived, unrealistic, stupid, needlessly cynical, and, yes, grimdark. Even the short story’s own author wasn’t happy about it and continually submitted revisions for a happier ending that were rejected by the editor. The editor made the right call.

The premise for The Cold Equations if you haven’t read it is a very simple one. Stop if you haven’t read the 1954 short story and intend to in the future. Basically, an astronaut is bringing a bunch of vital supplies to a space colony, but his life support is perfectly calibrated for one person and the discovery of a little girl stowaway means that he can’t make it with his passenger. If he kills her now, then he can make it and carry the supplies. There’s not really a choice because it’s not like the little girl could pilot the ship if he made it. The only option for anyone to live is her to die. So, the pilot does her in and is traumatized by the experience.

It’s a relentlessly cruel story designed to maximize the reader’s horror. Critics of the story highlight how many stupid mistakes had to have been made and poor decisions to bring about the events involved. Some cheap skate will have needed to have only left enough life support for one person, there had to have been almost no security around the spaceship, and the little girl must have been particularly dense about what dangers she’d be facing. The story even weights the issue that the astronaut can’t even die with her without condemning other people, presumably children, to death.

Yeah, fair.

Proponents of the story point don’t even have to mention that virtually all stories are contrived to some degree, especially in the science fiction/fantasy genre. They also have the unfortunate fact that reality is on the side of cynicism here. Right now, we have planes falling apart from a previously respectable flight construction company, Boeing, even in space. Perhaps it’s the fact I come from coal country, Kentucky and West Virginia, where human life has always taken a backseat to cost cutting.

The Cold Equations isn’t a critique of corporate greed or bad engineering, though. Perhaps if that was brought up then it would less controversial. John W. Campbell would probably be annoyed by it, though, and call it communist.  There’s no hint that if someone had just installed a couple of more oxygen tanks and heat-up meals that things would have gone fine. No, the premise of the short story is far worse: life is just unfair and bad shit just happens. There’s also a lot of times where you can’t do anything but minimize the damage (if even that).

The Cold Equations is often considered to be a critique of science heroes and Golden Age fiction. This is unnecessary because the critique is of fiction that is still popular. How many times on Star Trek has an impossible situation manifested before some plucky young hero come up with a solution on the computer that saves everyone? It doesn’t even need to be science fiction this day. The good guys will come up with a way to stop the terrorist to do something to someone just in time. That’s how stories work.

Except when they don’t.

It’s not even right to call The Cold Equations a tragedy in the classical sense because those stories depend on the flaws of the protagonists bringing them low. No, the horror of The Cold Equations is that it’s just bad luck that the best option is to do something horrible. Some people equate this as a moral statement from the story (citing the fascist ideal of “hard men making hard decisions”) but there’s nothing triumphant or strong about the hero’s choice. No, he’s broken emotionally and possibly mentally by the experience. It’s why the story is powerful.

If you disagree, let me ask you, a guy finds a little girl in his spaceship, and he figures out a way to recycle the oxygen with some jury-rigged tubes. They all make it safely to the colony and he’s lauded as a hero. How likely is THAT story to be remembered decades later?",fantasy

"Not a bad book, but very overrated - a Speedy Review of The Three Body Probem by Liu Cixin","This Hugo Award winning novel was published a number of years ago to massive acclaim. I knew it was a “hard science” SF novel so it took me a while before deciding to give it a try. The premise is that a device built by the Chinese communist gov’t for remote monitoring actually starts to communicate with an alien race. The motives of the aliens along with massively conflicting priorities of those on earth creates a very twisted situation.

The novel jumps back and forth between the early life of a young female scientist and the present day of a different scientist - with a handful of other p.o.v.s thrown in. The woman is the  daughter of a prominent physicist who was persecuted during the cultural reveolution and she herself was exiled … to this remote outpost. She has the initial interactions with first contactand her actions are motivated by her persecution. The modern day scientist finds himself embroiled in a conspiracy involving a video game predicated on an insolvable problem … the three body problem. He is egged on by a slightly crazy, marginalized police detective. 

As the two plotlines slowly come together you start to understand the dire situation humanity may be in. I don’t think I can provide much more without spoilers.

What I liked:

- the plot is brilliantly concieved, not so much the challenges inherent to first contact, and what that might mean for humanity, there isnt much new there … but the nature of the aliens themselves and the complexity of their motivations is really innovative.
- I liked  the way the plotlines intersected. The timing of that was well done. You could see it coming and Liu didnt overcook it by waiting too long
- the scientific elements of the plot drivers are fantastic. They are interesting, innovative, many of the ideas were completely new to me. 


What I did not like:

- the character work was not good. In fact I had to put it down for a while because I found them to be flat, undeveloped and largely uninteresting. I felt like they were elements of the plot being moved around like chess pieces in order to make the really clever plot work. They did not feel at all like drivers of the plot and at the end of the book I did not feel like I knew any of them. Even the “interesting” characters like the crude, rude, DGAF, unsophisticated but secretly super smart street cop had literally no other elements to his character. 

Note: I read this in English as opposed to in its original language so I may be missing out on nuance that is more apparent in the original.

So in summary, this was extremely clever science fiction without particularly good writing. You want to finish it because of the plot, not because you care about any of the characters or even believe they are people. Hence my assessment oxf overrated.

"[Review] Jam Reads: An Exile of Water and Gold, by Joshua Walker","https://preview.redd.it/cpaui3laxeod1.jpg?width=2700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da67eb94b5a8ea3619ddb11153f666856281dff

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/an-exile-of-water-and-gold-the-song-of-the-sleepers-1-by-joshua-walker)

*An Exile of Water and Gold* is the first novel in the dark epic fantasy series The Song of the Sleepers, written by Joshua Walker; a story of ambitious scope, with a really original worldbuilding, and deep touching. Deep themes that are enclosed into this fantasy mystery that represents also a great character study, combined with brushes of ecology and class-fight.

Drift, a young and cynical Aobian, is exiled from the Great Tree after what it's supposed to be an accident; while he's not able to understand the reason for his punishment, he will be forced to travel through the human lands, and find a new purpose to his life. However, he will discover that the human world is not exactly as they were told in the Great Tree.  
Tarri, his betrothed, would like to take Drift home; however, Drift's disappearing marks just the rising of tensions across the Tree. When the Sleeper Nischia asks her to investigate the circumstances behind Drift's accident, she will establish a complicated relationship with the Sleeper in order to take her lover back. An investigation that will be the perfect excuse to learn more about the Great Tree and the systems that rule above the Aobian society.  
With Nischia's thread, Walker portrays more about the Lumonisity and how the magic works in the Aobian society, putting those Sleepers that can access it over the rest; and we can appreciate how there are different factions craving for the power, risking all in order to go over the rest.  
And we have a non-Aobian perspective with Queen Esme, a young girl that is forced to assume the responsibility over her kingdom, a formative journey that she will have to take as fast as possible if she wants to keep the equilibrium of Q'ara.

All the threads are woven into a complex and ambitious story, full of twists and revelations that are, on many occasions, hidden behind different layers; not only that, but Walker takes the opportunity to weave a really emotionally impactful story. We can see how this novel is preparing the world for bigger moments, slowly setting the pawns on the chessboard, while perfectly fleshing those characters through their experiences and their targets.

Not only the plot is ambitious, but the themes deserve their own spotlight: the destruction of the ecosystems and how it is possible to regenerate them after enough work, the idolatry of those with power as gods and the injustice behind a locked class society. All of them are extensively explored, creating a thought-provoking experience.

The pacing is close to a slow-burn style, alternating between the POVs and slowly unraveling the whole plot; however, despite it, it doesn't feel slow at all, as every single page is full of meaningful moments for the plot.  
The worldbuilding is quite original, and it especially shines how Walker decides to go with mostly Aobian POVs, only having a single human perspective. It is interesting how the magic system is tied to the ecosystem, and Lumonisity itself is well explained alongside the novel.

*An Exile of Water and Gold* is an excellent debut novel, perfect for those that love ambitious worldbuildings mixed with a well-developed characters; an epic first novel that leaves you craving for more of Q'ara. Do yourself a favour, and read it!",fantasy
I'm looking for some rather specific recommendations,"Hello!

I'm interested in reading some books that fit within a few archetypes.  For one, I love fantasy that focuses more on the individual character's struggles and personal obstacles than the grandeur of ""the Quest"" and/or weaving together a big ole web of characters and societies.  Second, I love the perspective of fallen/failed heroes, \*especially\* when they're very introspective about their own shortcomings.  Third, while I do like books that trend toward the darker side of things, it's important to me that there is light in that darkness.  That while maybe the future is bleak, there are still good moments of camaraderie, love, laughter, whatever.  Also, I'm a sucker for a good soft magic system, and good prose can really enhance my enjoyment of a book.

The easiest comparison is the Name of the Wind, since I feel it satisfies most of the above points, but I'd love to hear recommendations based on any one of my criteria.  Thanks in advance!",fantasy
Sci fi book(s) most influential on music as a field?,"Lord of the Rings influenced and inspired a hell of a lot of songs and bands - lyrically, thematically, or just in choosing a name. 

I don't think it would be controversial to say that no sci fi work has had an equivalent impact. But which has had the most impact of any sci fi book? 

(
I'm saying book only because a. Same format as Lord of the Rings, and b. Mediums with audio elements often include theme songs, background music, scores etc., and I don't really count them since they're part of the work itself. So if anyone can think of a show or film that's had a bigger impact than books, excluding the official music, I'd be interested to hear. 

My own thoughts: maybe 1984 (if you consider that sci fi)? Or, still questionably sci fi, Frankenstein?",fantasy
Looking for a CLASSIC fantasy suggestions,"Sometimes I get tired of authors trying to completely reinvent the wheel. I just want a great story set in a somewhat generic fantasy world. Give me wizards, dragons, goblins, elves etc. I'm open to YA if it's good. I recently started the Death Gate Cycle series from Hickman and Weiss. Great series, but it's a bit too high fantasy and is a perfect example of what I DONT want at the moment. I don't mind new races, worlds, rules etc as long It's not overly complicated. Take Tolkien for example. The main focus is on the hero's journey. Yes, the lore is very deep and far reaching but its fairly easy to grasp and doesn't spend too much time explaining. I hope this makes sense. Any ideas?

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions! Now for the hard part, deciding which one to start with. So far I'm thinking The Broken Sword or The Belgariad series.

Book series about traveling and discovering things about the magical world,"So basically what I want is a fantasy book series where the protagonist travels a lot and slowly discovers how to do magic and about magical plants and beasts and what you can do with them.

MC shouldn't be overpowered for no reason. They should become powerful to an extent, but more so because they're smart about using their magic.

It shouldn't focus too much on action and fighting, so no final batty where the future of humanity is at stake or whatever, please.

Under the Whispering Door - Review (Spoilers!!),"Hello fellow readers,

To begin, I have never read a TJ Klune book up to this point. I know a lot of people have a lot of love for Cerulean, but I have not read it and cannot compare it to this work.

As to my review, this is not going to be a kind review. If others really like this book, I'd like to hear what you have to say and see what I may be missing.

First off, let me start with the positives

This book would be excellent for a YA audience of 10-13 year olds. After completing it, I was very confused why this wasn't marketed as a YA effort, in the first place.

The book is structured well and has a beginning, midpoint and ending, with a central conflict that gets resolved. That counts for something.

The book does have some funny bits that actually made me smirk/laugh, especially at the beginning. I initially bought the book because of the first 5 pages and how funny and over-the-top Wallace was, as a human being.

Now, onto the characters and some general thoughts

Wallace - The key character in the book. He's basically Mr Scrooge in modern times, as a lawyer. Everything is about profit, everything should be just as he likes and he has no empathy for anyone. He's probably my 'favorite' character in the story, as there isn't really a lot to pick from. His journey is so-so and fairly trite, but I do find him to be somewhat likeable.

Nelson - Probably my least favorite character in the book. He's basically a character from Sandford &amp; Sons or any piece of fiction where a crotchety old man has a heart of gold. His mind has unlimited knowledge and he knows just about everything, but he is only going to tell you if you put up with enough of his 'old man' antics. Naturally, he has a heart of gold on the inside. He is very 2-dimensional and lacks any depth. He feels like a caricature and not a character.

Mei - For someone who is 'the best Reaper that has ever been', which must include hundreds of thousands of reapers, if not millions, the book doesn't show anything about why she is good or why she is particularly special. Wallace is her first case and she doesn't do a very good job with him, as he runs away. She doesn't do a great job with Alan, as he turns violent. She's basically special and grand because the book tells us she is, which is very unsatisfying.

Hugo - He's a lot like Mei. We're to believe he is very special and grand, but we don't really see or understand why. Most of his conversations are similar to this

Wallace is angry

Huge talks to Wallace, saying it's ok to be angry and that everyone's journey is different.

Wallace continues to be angry

Hugo goes outside and shows him some tea plants

Wallace eventually stops being so angry

Hugo gives him some very trite speech about death and different paths.

That's about it. Hugo doesn't speak in any grand terms, doesn't have any great philosophical depth, his arguments aren't complex at all, he's very simple. I simply do not understand what makes him great and found most of his words, uncompelling. I don't mean to disparage Hugo, but just about anyone with some sense of empathy and awareness, would be able to provide a similar level of assistance. 

Apollo - A ghost dog, even though the book clearly states that dogs don't have souls. Apparently Apollo is a special dog and other dogs are not special, so he gets to have an afterlife. Apparently, if everyone else's dogs were as good of a dog as he is, they would get an afterlife too, but they are not and they just die. What a weird lesson/statement to make in a book.

The Youtube 'Medium - I can't even be bothered to remember what her name is. She was so 2 dimensional and so cartoon-esque, that it's hard to believe someone wrote this character to be a 'real' person in their story. Her role is purely perfunctory, to allow a piece of the plot to move ahead at a later state in the book. It felt like the author simply needed someone for this plot point and created this ridiculous character.

The Manager - A character that is sometimes fun and interesting and sometimes...quite childish and lacking depth. For a creature that is old as time and a god, he doesn't seem that smart or complex. Folks who have read the book, remember the ending, something that doesn't feel true to this character, at all. We also never learn anything interesting about this character, where he comes from, what he is, what he does, what he believes, who he answers to, what his powers are, what his goals are...we get a few slivers of information, but it seems the author knows he can't answer any of these questions with interesting ideas, so he just doesn't answer them at all, which was frustrating.

That about sums up the characters.

As to the actual plot of the story, it was quite a let-down. Death is made to seem so simple, even though the story seems to be trying to deal with the complexities of death and the afterlife. It asks a lot of questions that it never answers in any real way. The way the author designs the after-life and those involved, is not very satisfying.

The dead are connected via cables (which is a weird choice since 'cables' were first designed for transmission of electricity and signal, several hundred years ago. Previously, would they have to spend a bunch of time explaining the concept of a cable? Why use something modern? Why not just use a rope or an invisible connection? The only reason that makes sense is that Wallace needs to use his cable for a plot arc, later in the story, so the author decided to make people connected via cables...not because it was a good idea, but because the plot demanded it, which is a bad instinct IMO).

The tea shop where all this takes place, is a bigger fantasy than the afterlife. It's bustling everyday and people come from miles around to fill a random tea shop out in the country. Business is booming constantly. It's basically the dream any new small business owner has, but one that is very rarely a reality. I don't know if TJ Klune has a desire to open a tea shop someday, but it sounds more like wish fulfillment than an actual place. I would have preferred the tea shop to struggle and add to the drama of the story.

As to the ending of the story, I literally rolled my eyes. Wallace had learned his lessons and was ready to go, but they made him stay, because that is what the author wanted to do. It was very unsatisfying and left me annoyed.

I also have to note that a book about assisting the dead into the afterlife, has to feel believable. It has to feel like it could exist within the world we currently live in. This book and it's characters seem like they are on another Earth-like planet where this type of existence is possible. The idea that there are tens or hundreds of thousands of reapers around us, is ridiculous. The notion that ghosts are regularly impacting physical objects all around us, is also ridiculous. We would have evidence of such things all around us, all the time. This doesn't feel believable, at all...and that is the fault of the author. This should feel plausible and it doesn't.

I wish I had better things to say, but I'd give this book about a 1.5/5 or a 2/5. If they recategorized this as YA, I'd give it a 4/5, as I do think the book does a good job with what it has, if you're looking through the eyes of an 11 year old, someone who doesn't understand death and needs some help getting used to the ideas (or moving on from a death they have experienced).

To sum it up, a great story to give your young nephew, for an adult, spend your time on something else.",fantasy
"Hi, I’m PRASHANTH SRIVATSA, author of THE SPICE GATE, and several short stories. I’m giving away 3 copies of my debut epic fantasy novel, ready to be shipped internationally. Ask me Anything!","I’m Prashanth Srivatsa, author of The Spice Gate, an epic fantasy novel that came out in July 2024, from HarperVoyager in U.S., U.K. and India. It is a story where spices power magical portals to distant kingdoms, and one young man must free himself and his family from the burdens of the spice trade. Last month, The Spice Gate was a Sunday Times bestseller. Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, calling it a ‘masterful epic fantasy, bursting with flavor’.

[The U.S. and U.K. covers of The Spice Gate](https://preview.redd.it/llj9l7n4xdod1.jpg?width=1082&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b7a1529bd5f1db2674da042979bef18ea8e2b7)

In this novel, the world is divided into eight far-flung kingdoms, each producing one particular spice. Carriers, born to travel through the Gates must shepherd the goods and spices from one kingdom to another. It’s back-breaking painful, and worse, socially ostracizing. Carriers barely get spices for themselves. Amir thinks it’s bollocks. He’s had enough of the spice trade, enough of being a Career. Especially now, when his younger brother is set to join this laborious trail.

But something stirs in the wild, untamed spaces between the eight kingdoms. Secrets are slipping out, and the world that teeters on the spice trade’s precarious balance threatens to crumble, all with the determined, biryani-seeking Amir at the heart of trouble. Spice Gate has everything – good ol’ adventure, a touch of romance, pirates on treacherous seas, angry gods, monsters prowling the dark skies, courtroom drama, and above all – food. Always lots of food.

If you enjoyed S.A. Chakraborty’s Daevabad trilogy, or her Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi, or Ken Liu’s Dandelion Dynasty, if you like expansive worldbuilding, overcoming incredible odds, and sprinkles of food in your narrative, the Spice Gate is perfect for you.

A last bit more about myself: I’m based out of Bangalore in India, and have a full-time job of valuing mergers and acquisitions for a consulting firm. I can assure you that The Spice Gate is not born out of frustrations from that demanding job, which to be honest, I sometimes do enjoy. My partner, and our two cats - Leia and Yoda - say hello.

Sword of Kaigen. I am furious and disappointed ,"Actually I liked the first half, Mamoru was a character I liked to read. His development both in martial arts and mind was good. Learning about the lies of the emperor, having real friendships, having a real bond with his mother,  having own ideas and talking about them with bravery against his ice cold father. I liked it very much, we watched becoming him a man. And I was so sure that he was going go do more, I was so excited. I actually cared about misakı only because her relationship with his son.
Then he died, that made me mad. Our main character which the story was build on was dead. So I stopped reading. There is nothing to read more. Misaki is not interesting. His family relations. Random vigilante biz with robin. Takeru’s weird-ass-random coldness. Your son died god dammit. And how can Takashi died, take that injury to back. 
And now look how my boy died. So he was fighting a black, 2 mins ago Mamoru killed a black. And yes we can say this guy was stronger but Mamoru wasn’t a doll either.

"[Review] Salute the Dark by Adrian Tchaikovsky (Shadows of the Apt, Book 4 of 10)","*There are no explicit plot spoilers in this review.*

* Book 4: Salute the Dark (this review)
* Book  5: The Scarab Path

**Salute the Dark** is the fourth book in Adrian Tchaikovsky's Shadows of the Apt series, It is a definite high point, offering a strong, exciting convergence of all of the threads introduced so far.

Although Uctebri the Mosquito-Kinden has finally claimed the feared Shadow Box, it comes at a time when the Wasp campaign may have stretched itself too thin, undermined by personal machinations of its Generals, growing alliances in the Lowlands, and unrest in several key border cities. Stenwold Maker and his allies scatter across the world to put their fingers in different parts of the proverbial dike, hoping that the combination of all their efforts will be enough to turn the tide. Meanwhile, the tortured Tisamon strikes his own path, never certain if his so-called destiny stems from a hidden influence tipping the scales of his guilt.

There are some unusual pacing decisions in this book, with some key events essentially happening off the page or in an abrupt paragraph while other battles and duels are stepped through in exhausting detail. This makes time pass in fits and starts, but the payoff of the steamrolling conclusion (the last third of the book) makes it all worthwhile. And, while the convergence of threads and the nullification of a main threat seems at first to be too neat, the final chapter organically introduces a brooding threat without feeling like a cliffhanger.

I enjoyed the development of all the main characters, but none so much as Thalric and his volatile relationship with the Wasp Empire. Besides characters, I also liked the deepening complexity of the Wasp Empire as more than a unified monolith, and the ongoing evolution of war technology underpinning the story. I was on the fence about the series after finishing Book 2, but Book 4 cemented my appreciation – it's definitely worth reading the first four books even if you go no further.",fantasy
How long would you read a book for before you DNF it?,"Heard good things about Neil Gaiman’s American Gods. Was about 250 pages in before I DNFed it. Nothing was happening in all that time. And I was curious, and people said the rest of the book is more of the same so I decided not to continue.

I think if by 200-300 pages into a good chunk of the book, and nothing has happened yet during all that time, I question if the book is worth finishing.

"The Lord Ruler's portrayal worries me. I hope The Stormlight Archive doesn't do this.
","I'll preface this post by saying this is not out of dislike for the Mistborn trilogy. I'm not trying to impose my moral viewpoints onto fellow cosmerenauts. And it's not meant to dismiss that fantasy characters can have their own unique beliefs. This is simply a rant on a topic that's bugged me ever since finishing The Hero of Ages. It came back as I was contemplating Era 2's nuanced portrayal of Elendel’s problems, Harmony's plans, and Autonomy's mindset. And since I'm reading The Stormlight Archive after Warbreaker, this involves a hope of mine.

My journey throughout Scadrial created an increasing sense of concern and worry over the Lord Ruler's portrayal. In my eyes, book 3 fell into the trap of characters defending the Lord Ruler's actions. Simply because they were for the goal of preserving the world. To be clear, I understand what Sanderson was trying to do. He wanted to make a world where most characters, even when destroying the evil empire, ultimately wanted a stable world. And for that, I understand why Vin or Sazed would call Rashek a ""good man with honorable intentions.""

Vin always wanted a stable life. And when she thanked the Lord Ruler as Preservation, I bet her opinions of TLR were being slightly filtered by Preservation's Intent. Sazed Ascended with full access to how Ruin and Preservation connected back to Rashek. He knew Rashek in ways no one could imagine.

So while their claims were understandable, it felt extremely gross. My first issue is that I lack the same knowledge of Rashek as Vin or Sazed. I only know Rashek as a bitter, violent glory hound Terrisman who ***maybe*** had slivers of understandable motives before Ascending. Then I only know him as an evil emperor going insane for 1000 years. I don't know the ""good man"" Rashek. I know the asshole who did 5% good things and 95% ends justify the means.

My second issue is that the ""suffered under Ruin's hand"" removed accountability. Rashek didn't ***NEED*** to make slaves out of most remaining humans, turn his people into jellyfish, restrict Allomancy to the ruling class, sacrifice humans for koloss armies, or wipe out all religions and cultures. But that line pinned it on Ruin's influence, even though Rashek did horrible things and made horrible plans ***during*** the Ascension. Instead of holding Rashek himself accountable for his own actions.

And on that note, fuck Rashek for even mentioning Ruin's whispers in the Fadrex city plate. Yeah sure, centuries of Ruin's influence pushed him to make the Terris breeding program. But those reprehensible actions above were all Rashek's fault when he was a new conqueror.

My third issue is the erasure of potential depth behind Ruin and Preservation's conflict. It doesn't give Preservation something 100% despicable to actively do. It ignores the fact Ruin doesn't insert new personalities, but rather influences what is already there. Ruin was the ***method*** through which Rashek did things, but Preservation is the ***reason and goal***. Rashek ruined to preserve.

Brandon should’ve settled for Sazed acknowledging the tragedy and genius behind Rashek’s efforts, while acknowledging they were reprehensible and weren’t solely orchestrated by Ruin. I don't know what The Stormlight Archive will hold. But if there are any characters who go ""ends justify the means"" or ""it's not my fault it's the god,"" I sincerely hope Brandon calls out their rusting nonsense with a hammer. He did it with Kelsier (complicated feelings about that), he did not do it with Rashek. I hope he does it in Stormlight.

(Specific Request) Time travel into the body of a historical figure,"This is a pretty specific request but I really love the concept and hope I can find something similar.

A modern person’s mind (or soul) is transferred back in time into the body of a known historical figure, ideally at a critical moment in history and said figure facing a grim fate.

The idea is similar to *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* and other such time travel books, but instead of the protagonist starting from scratch, they inhabit an existing person who is already integrated into society, like a monarch or military leader. Facing an impending crisis, the protagonist must use their knowledge of history and modern inventions to survive and improve their situation.

Here are some examples of historical figures that fit the bill and would be interesting to explore:

* King Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette of France before the French Revolution.
* Tsar Nicholas II of Russia before WW1 and the Communist Revolution.
* Anne Boleyn, 2nd wife of the volatile King Henry the 8th
* Cleopatra, Last Queen of Egypt facing the wrath of Rome.
* Nero, mad Emperor of Rome.

"spoiler discussion for ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" by Ursula K. Le Guin","I have recently read ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" by Ursula K. Le Guin. I can see the merit in the book and why it deserves its accolades. It is a unique coming of age story like everyone says. One thing I do notice is that it's not very typical. Yes, it does move the protagonist (Ged) around a lot, surprisingly at the beginning of the story as he starts on the island, taps into his power to generate fog to deter invaders, and gets passed along to a wizard to train him. However, that wizard realizes that Ged needs to begin the more structured programming to realize his potential thus sends him to a wizarding school. I can see where the inspiration for Hogwarts from Harry Potter comes from. Of course that sequence where he casted a strong magic spell to supposedly raise the dead and heavily backfired, all in the name of trying to one up another peer. Not to mention it resulted in the loss of life and sacrifice of one of the head masters of the school. Then he spends the rest of the book trying to rectify his mistake as he travels across the world. One thing I do like is that the exposition that is introduced it is not fully explicit. It is gradually hinted at here and there and it makes one pay attention, infer certain things, and eventually figure it out. He does find situations where he bites off more than he could choose such as when he almost gets tricked by that one girl in order to activate the magic stone. It has to take on the form of a hawk in order to escape and then return to his old mentor. Before that sequence of events, I liked how he began taking smaller humble odd jobs across the land, such as providing protection from the Dragons. But then he realizes that they need to be addressed accordingly before he can move on and he call that Dragon's bluff and says the Dragon's name . I like how he begins to face the shadow creature, starting to turn the tide on it and have him doing the chasing instead of being chased by the shadow itself. I do like how he reunites with one of his old friends in order to take on the shadow creature at the end together. I do like how it is not something giant climatic battle but just a matter of outsmarting and finding one's true identity and rectifying the actions of once past.

This is a Reddit post, not an academic essay. I am not going to excuse my occasional lapses in grammar or my paragraph structure. This is all talk to text. I know I do not go into much detail regarding all the specific characters and locations. I do not remember them all because I read several books right after this one

Based on my experience posting in previously posting on this subreddit, apparently it seems to be a cardinal sin if you do not fully understand and appreciate a book the first time you read it. You are not allowed to find something confusing or be lost. Well I am secure enough to admit that there were times where I was lost or confused when reading this book. The author's writing style is unique, but I do how technical her prose, word play, exposition, and descriptions are. Like I mentioned before, it is all these nuances which establishes her identity as an author. It's not just storytelling and info dump. There is a method to everything and she is skillfully building and guiding us long as appropriate. Like I said before, I may not have100% I've expected everything from this book. However it does challenge me and keeps me curious. I am inclined to read other books in the series and possibly other books by this author.",fantasy
Looking for a good adventure book,"Looking for a good fiction book preferably from like a knights/adventurers pov. Something like the hobbit or LotR where friendships are made, a slice of life story-telling and maybe a romance side story. To be clear though romance doesn't have to be the plot, mostly the journey.

I've been reading too many romances and am kinda burned out in real life rn so I want to find something that can make me appreciate everyday life/interactions. I find that romance books in YA/Fiction is too intense too fast or just straight up smut and while I do like to indulge having it in every book is exhausting.

Any book recommendations would be great 👍. Also I'm a big fan of dragons and mythical creatures so that too.

Review: Haunt Sweet Home by Sarah Pinsker,"*NetGalley and the publisher have my thanks for providing me with a review copy.*

Haunt Sweet Home is a not-so-spooky ghost story set primarily on the set of a haunted house home renovation reality TV show. It has some heart and some laughs, but it falls a bit short of a home run hit. 

Pinsker gives us a main character who is a bit stuck. She's tried college a few times and a few jobs, but nothing has seemed to work. Of course, this comes to a head at a family gathering where the successful TV show host cousin offers her a job as an assistant on the set of his show. 

This goes pretty normally, honestly, but eventually, things get a little bit weird. This is the primary hook of the book, and honestly, I felt it was one of the weakest. There's always a delicate line to try and straddle when it comes to introducing an element the reader may guess before the character, and even though everything in this novella has a relatively short page count, I felt the time between the twist becoming a bit obvious and the main character figuring it out drug a bit. 

That being said, the found family vibes in this were pretty solid, and I always appreciate when the born family isn't despicable in found family stories. 

Overall, if you're in the mood for a non-spooky-spooky-season book or a quick read that incorporates traditionally scary elements without much scare, this would be a good grab from your library.

How do you track short story reads? Do you?,"Over the last couple of years, I've found myself really enjoying more and more short fiction, thanks in large part to our recurring Bingo square. While I typically do hard mode for this square and thus read an entire anthology or collection, I've started branching out and reading single stories or reading only a few stories from a collection.

Typically, I track my reading via StoryGraph and I'm overall quite happy with the platform. However, it and similar sites have some oddities when you track short stories. So I'm curious how, if you track your short story reading, you do!

Some considerations:

- StoryGraph gives stats about what I read that I find interesting and fun, like repeat authors, graphs of how many books I read over time that I can compare against, say, last year. Tracking short stories individually artificially inflates these - StoryGraph doesn't currently support excluding tracked things from this unless the read date is undated.

- I can use notes to track which stories are in a collection and/or which I read, but its not easily viewable.

- Being able to look up what I've read can be really helpful for jogging memories, etc.",fantasy

Charlotte Reads: Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson,"**Blurb:**  
*All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.*  
  
*Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.*  
  
*As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.*  
  
**My Thoughts:**  
  
I’ve been saving this for a while because I was afraid it wouldn’t live up to my hopes for it. I was very brave and took the plunge to finally read it earlier this year, and I am so glad I did. This is an incredibly lovely, fun story and I would happily devour many more books in the Margaret Rogerson vein of YA fantasy. Its adventure is engaging, its atmosphere is lovely, and its romance is very sweet.  
  
Above all, the the trio of central characters makes this book as fun as it is. The protagonist Elisabeth is really endearing to me, especially because she has such a strong sense of right and wrong and a tendency to act decisively (and slightly chaotically). Her love interest, the charming young magician Nathaniel, tends to remark on this in a very amusing, affectionate way, describing her with epithets like “feral librarian” and “absolute menace.” I thought that their relationship was very cute overall, but he was a bit too absent for about a quarter of the book and his constant quips about being a heartbreaker got a little repetitive. The third member of their trio, the demon Silas, is quite unique in how he challenges their world’s conceptions of good and evil,. The complex history of his relationship with Nathaniel is quite moving, as is his &gt;!sacrifice at the end of the book.!&lt;  
  
The other standout quality in this book is certainly its atmosphere, especially in how the magical libraries and opinionated magical grimoires are described. &gt;!The grimoires’ last stand defending the library at the end and the book’s ultimate reveals - that the library is sentient, that Elisabeth is a child of the library - all weave together in a way that feels so simultaneously polished and emotional.!&lt;  
  
Plot-wise, there are definitely some elements that strain credulity or remain undescribed in a way that feels a bit dissatisfying. &gt;!Why did Prendergast have to create his alternate dimension instead of turning into a regular grimoire? What were Ashcroft’s descendants doing for centuries until our current Ashcroft launched his plan? Why would Elisabeth growing up for 15 years in the library have more impact than an older person who’d been there for much longer? If the library is sentient enough to be able to help our protagonists, why wasn’t it able to misdirect Ashcroft? How did Prendergast get the name of the Archon?!&lt;  
  
Still, this was just a thoroughly lovely reading experience. Of the soft, romantic, vibes-heavy fantasy I’ve read lately (Allison Saft, Rebecca Ross, Ava Reid, etc.) I think Margaret Rogerson has impressed me the most, and I can’t wait to read whatever she writes next.",fantasy
Books/series that are heavily character-driven with likeable protagonists?,"Hey there,

Is there any standalone novels or short series that I can just jump into without missing a ton of context? TIA,fantasy
Is there a book/series of books where only men have magic?,"I've been thinking recently about how many stories from my childhood even now have only witches and no wizards/very few wizards. Do you know any series where it's the other way around? Although I'm not a fan of gendered magic systems, I'm really interested.
I mean only stories where women simply don't have magic. I would also like to ask the downvoters to justify their decision at least a little, if it doesn't bother them 😘👌🏻",fantasy
I'm itching for a time-loop fantasy,"I recently finished reading Mother Of Learning and then got to reading another novel but it wasn't too good and since i liked MOL so much i wanna see if there are any other time-loop stories like it.


I'd also prefer if the mc was a morally grey character, like, Actually grey personality.


Some gore with characters dying.


And lastly, a well rounded magic system. A comprehensive one. A magic system where you couldn't just ass pull something because it's too loose. The magic systems of MOL and Overlord for example were good.


If the story had everything but it wasn't set in a magical world I'd settle for that too, as a last resort.


Thank you.",fantasy
Books with magic system like avatar the last Airbender but a darker setting like the one in Mistborn.,So I'm watching avatar the last airbender on netflix and I like the show but I feel I wanted a more darker/violent take on the power system and the world.,fantasy
Para's Proper Reviews: The Book of Love by Kelly Link,"*The book of love is long and boring*, goes [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtbrDFgB_4). Well, I hoped when I picked it up, at a little over 600 pages, it certainly is long, but boring…let’s hope not. I had high expectations. Weird magic literary shit is exactly up my alley. In the end, I have mixed feelings. I definitely liked the weird unexplainable magic shit, but it was stuffed between so, so much of the most incredibly tedious teenage relationship drama.

In the little Massachusetts town called Lovesend (should that be love-send or love’s-end?), three teens who disappeared nearly a year ago (plus one extra) suddenly come back from the dead. They are met by their high school music teacher and a wolf-man who explain their new undead situation, conjure an excuse for their absence for townsfolks to believe, and set them tasks. Like doing magic. How? Fuck you, go figure it out, that’s how.

There are immediately questions and I love a book with some good questions. Who are Bogomil and Anabin? How did the teens die? Why are they back? What must they do? What’s up with the magic? Those sort of mysteries are like catnip to me. The weirder, the more unexplained, and the more slowly revealed the magic, the better. At the beginning, and during the last quarter of the story, I couldn’t put down the book. I had to know.

The middle ~350 pages…not so much. The good stuff was hidden among far too much bickering and who-fucked-whom for my taste. Which is fine if you’re the sort of person who finds teenage drama interesting, but I’m really, really not. I wasn’t into it and couldn’t relate even when I was a teenager myself. I don’t care how many times Laura’s sister Susannah hooked up with Daniel. I don’t care who they screwed in between and whose dick did what. It was *constant*, it was incredibly banal, and it started before the characters were in any way established i.e. before I had any reason to care about them. I was so frustrated. I couldn’t even skip because sometimes, there would be some interesting magical oddity, or an appearance of a character I liked, so I had to grit my teeth and push on.

Not that I ever got to care about most of the characters. Susannah, Laura, and Mo might suck and make bad choices in realistic, mundane ways. Daniel might be so boring that even other characters remark on it. But the fact that all of it was intentional doesn’t make up for the unpleasantness of the reading experience. Daniel’s mischievous, chaotic little siblings were an absolute delight, but as mentioned above, Daniel himself is a yawnfest. The only interesting main character, Bowie (also unpleasant, but at least with *interesting* issues), was constantly sidelined and far less present than I would have hoped for. Even at the end, his subplot just…fizzled out.

Which was sadly true for a lot of what I liked. Even the ending, the most compelling bit by far, wasn’t without flaws. An interesting subplot is introduced, only for it to be resolved immediately, in one or two pages per character. It was over before I could finish thinking “Ooh, now we’re getting somewh…nevermind.” Why couldn’t we have that in the middle, instead of all the stuff I’ve forgotten immediately?

Anyway. It was definitely more book than me this time, but I’d still recommend it with caution.

The feeling of having read everything,"Maybe it's analysis-paralysis or book/series hangover or a bad streak of mediocre reads, but sometimes I get the feeling that I've read everything I wanted to read or that I won't find any more good books.

Book Review: The Gods Below by Andrea Stewart,"**TL;DR Review:** A singularly creative and fresh-feeling reading experience. An excellent start to a gripping new series.

https://preview.redd.it/hhvncsqd37od1.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adf890e28b9b759a4156230c437906b06327abf8

**Full Review:**

*The Gods Below* is a true standout in the fantasy genre, a book that feels fresh and new while still delivering a familiar emotionally devastating reading experience.

At its core, the story is about two things: the burden of expectations and the cost of ambition.

Half of the book follows sisters Hakara and Rasha. Hakara has done everything in her power to care for her younger sister, whatever it takes no matter how dangerous. But when she is separated from Rasha by a magical barrier and transformation that leaves her sister “altered”, she dedicates herself to earning enough to buy her way through the barrier at any cost. Ten grueling years of trying her hardest and holding herself to this impossible *need* to get to her sister weighs heavily on her. Nothing can get her out from beneath the suffocating, all-consuming burden that influences her every decision.

Rasha has lived under the expectation of being the smaller, weaker, younger sister in need of protection. Even ten years later, she is still struggling to break from those shadows. When the god Kluehn mocks her for being too weak and soft to survive the trials that will turn her into one of his “godkillers”, it sparks a flame within her and drives her to break free of the role. She will do whatever it takes to never be seen as “weak” again.

The roles into which these sisters have been cast are such powerful motivators behind their actions and choices. Yet their reactions will lead them down paths that may take them so far apart nothing, not even their love for each other, can bring them back together again.

The other half of the book follows Mullayne and his cousin Sheuan. Mull is an inventor who is driven by the burning need to follow the path an ancient hero took to the core of the world to petition the gods for a boon. In his mind, he does so to save his best friend—and unrequited love—from a degenerative disease, but to the reader, it is clear that it is his ambition that compels him to press on even when everything and everyone around him falls into darkness.

Sheuan has been raised to be the survival of her clan, a pawn trained by her mother and the mysterious Mitoran to be the perfect political, sexual, intellectual, and martial weapon. Though the ambition is external to her—a diametric opposite to Mull’s—it is no less a driving force that keeps her from making her own choices, leaving her a prisoner in her own life no matter how much she wishes for control.

The pursuit of these various ambitions—finding the gods and saving her people—lead both Mull and Sheuan to do things that go against their very nature, and both they and those they love will pay a steep price.

The characters are incredibly complex, flawed, and engaging from the very beginning. The strong narrative voice drives the action and character development forward at a relentless pace. The story and thematic elements are layered with a deft hand and clever subtlety that makes for a deeper-than-expected reading experience.

And the worldbuilding—I have yet to read a world quite as creative and unique as this!

It’s evocative of ancient China and Mongolia, complete with harsh deserts, lush forests, and elaborate, colorful cities filled with both indigenous people and refugees clinging to their traditions and customs in the face of cultural annihilation.

The war between the gods—as laid out both through the chapter openings and the lore recounted in the story—adds a lovely layer of complexity that amplifies the “fantastical” feel of this world.

It’s a singular, spectacular addition to the fantasy genre, and a brilliant introduction to a new series I can’t wait to continue exploring.",fantasy
Under the Northern Sky Series by Leo Carew,"Wanted to get other people's take on this series. An utterly enjoyable and captivating series for me, with a good few tears cried at the ending of the Cuckoo, which maybe could have been ended in a different way? Curious to see what other people think regarding this.

  
Roper and the Anakim could have potentially won the battle now, in my humble opinion, through either divine intervention such as what happened in the first book (yes, or luck), however I would have loved to see Roper win this last battle, coming back from the dead to lead the Anakim to victory against the Sutherners.

Help Me Pick My Next Series,"Hi all- I'm fairly new here. As I've gotten older I've become infatuated with the fantasy genre. My interest in fantasy has always been prevalent, but it really started to peak once I started exploring the genre through gaming (Witcher 3, Elden Ring, Skyrim)

While I've been an on and off reader my whole life, earlier this year (March) I decided I was going to jump into an epic fantasy series to see if I liked it. Well, after crushing 8 1/2 books of the Echoes Saga since March (will complete all 9 by the end of this month), I can straight up tell you guys, I'm smitten. The escapism, wonder, whimsy, lore, characters, etc., have completely captivated me.

Now I'm in really cool spot of being on the verge of wrapping up an epic story/series, as well as hunting for my next series. How exciting!

That's where you all come in. I've read through many many recommendations on this sub, so I'd rather not have a re-hash of the same thread and the same recommendations. So I'd like to be a bit more pointed in my request. 

To start, I'm not the brightest bulb in the kitchen. Meaning, I can have a hard time connecting the dots, making sense of analytical concepts, or figuring out deeper meanins of things. I'm more interested in being spoon-fed. That's not to say I'm a dummy, but I don't want to work too hard. I also don't want to read Young Adult fantasy either. 
 
Here's exactly what I'm looking for and what I'm currently considering. If your recommendation meets my list of things I'd like to have with my next series, PLEASE SHARE.

Would-like-to-have a 3-4 book FINISHED series with:

*A map
*A codex, bestiary, or appendix that can offer additional lore, world/character building, etc.
*A dramatis personae

LORE LORE LORE
Beasts/goblins/dark creatures/grotesqueness
*Essentially, anything ""more than"" the story itself that I could take in and refer to while reading or while not engrossed in the story. MORE LORE!

"[Review] Jam Reads: Extremophile, by Ian Green","https://preview.redd.it/8udlccnlu6od1.jpg?width=325&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d312efe2f68c3db1868a1e4ea0fd754273832008

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/extremophile-by-ian-green)

*Extremophile* is a risky and innovative biopunk thriller set in a dystopic future written by Ian Green (*The Rotstorm Trilogy*), and published by Ad Astra. In a climate-collapse London, Charlie and Parker are punks and biohackers; when they are offered a job by a group of Greens (activists that still think there is hope to save and revert the situation), Charlie was sure they should reject, but Parker convinces him there's still something to do for the world, throwing them in an incredible mission that will make them face corporations, amoral biohackers and criminals. 

**Kill the Ghost. Steal the Flower. Save the World.**

With this premise, Green weaves a frenetic and intense story that screams punk all the time, from the own characters and their mission, to even the writing style. A job that is bigger than Charlie and Parker, and that will put them in the middle of the bullseye, while making them to rethink about their own convictions; a contrast between the nihilism bordering the Black associated with Charlie with the hope and idealism that still exists inside Parker.  
The main characters are well fleshed, offering a really intimate look into their ideas and opinions, which also are affected by their contact with this group of Greens that hire them. We can appreciate how there's still a shade of hope inside Charlie, and how even if she doesn't believe that the solution for the world is hidden in a flower; the secondary characters play key roles in the plot, and we even get to follow the villain, an amoral biohacker that seemed a bit inspired by Mengele's actions.

Not only we have an excellent cast of characters, but a quite hooking plot that ties all together while being a thought provoking; not only putting the spotlight onto themes such as bio-augmenting and the price paid as a consequence of corporate greed, but also into the importance of community and the balance between optimism and nihilism. 

The writing style is quite particular, reinforcing that punk essence of this book; from the use of multiple POVs to the absence of quotation marks, giving you a more intimate following of the characters. Descriptions are evocative, almost poetical.   
The worldbuilding is effortlessly integrated into the narration, not being too extensive and focusing more on what we can learn through the characters' lives and actions; climate-collapse is a reality, and this Britain is mostly a hyper-capitalist dystopia in the control of corporations. We also dive into punk and music, and I loved how the Extremophile is full of small nerdy (and accurate) genetic details, making the biohacking to feel more authentic.

*Extremophile* is an excellent novel; from the writing style to the characters, I found every aspect of this book to complement each other to deliver an incredible and hopeful story. Definitely one of the candidates to be my book of the year, as Ian Green has absolutely nailed it!",fantasy
Reviewing a short fiction binge month: August retrospective,"As the excellent Short Fiction Book Club crew warmed up for Season 3 ([join us next Wedesday for a new session!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1f8r0ro/short_fiction_book_club_mini_mosaics/)), I realized that I had an enormous pile of story tabs open and wasn’t reading them as quickly as I wanted, especially if I wanted to build great themes for my own sessions.

I finished the month having read 86 stories and really enjoyed myself, so here are some of my favorites from this experiment.

# Top five

This list is chronological (in the order I read the stories), not ranked, and is interestingly tilted toward the back half of the month: I read the first one of these on August 14th. I had tried work from four of these authors and venues before, but  M.V. Melcer and Weird Horror were new to me. 

“[Stitched to Skin like Family Is](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/stitched-to-skin-like-family-is/)” by Nghi Vo (Uncanny Magazine)

This subtle story rides the line between grief and horrifying events, with Vo’s gorgeous prose giving exactly enough detail to explain what’s necessary but leave you wanting more. Her universe of stories about American magic that varies by region and time period is just gorgeous, and I hope she publishes all of them in a collection one day.



“Remember This For Me” by Sarah Pinsker, available in her *Lost Places* collection

Sarah Pinsker excels at telling subtle and bittersweet stories, and this is one of the best in the collection for me. This tale of an artist losing her memory after a lifetime of complex projects with her Muse (who both inspires her and causes that memory loss) is absolutely haunting.



“[You’ll Understand When You’re a Mom Someday](https://www.khoreomag.com/fiction/youll-understand-when-youre-a-mom-someday/)” by Isabel J. Kim (khōréō)

I’ve been spreading out the IJK backlog to save as treats, and this one didn’t disappoint. The alien logic and clever use of bargains and phrasing worked so well for me–I’d love to see her write a whole horror novel one day.

I almost put together my top five early, but I had a hunch that something amazing would emerge from the tab hoard near the end, and it absolutely did on August 29, when I read these two absolute gems. 

“[The Falling](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/melcer_07_21/)” by M.V. Melcer (Clarkesworld)

This story lives at the intersection of difficult equations and the struggle to make human decisions on a spaceship trying to outrun its own destruction. The story simmers with grief and resolve: if it came out this year, it would be a hard lock for my Hugo nominating ballot.



“[Cretins](https://www.weirdhorrormagazine.com/cretins)” by Thomas Ha (Weird Horror)

I thought I knew where this story was going three or four times, but it kept flipping on me in unexpected ways. The narrator’s tight perspective, with all its vulnerability and cleverness, really carries this story.

# Other highlights

**Favorite reread:** “[Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/where-oaken-hearts-do-gather/)” by Sarah Pinsker (Uncanny Magazine)

This was an absolute banger the first time I read it, and it’s even better on a second reading to catch all the little details. For me, this is the peak of using internet-comments formatting to tell a story indirectly.

**Best flash piece:** “[When We Make It to Bet-Zelem](https://www.khoreomag.com/fiction/when-we-make-it-to-bet-zelem/)” by Louis Evans (khōréō)

The last few paragraphs of this story absolutely pulled the whole thing together for me. The intersection of stories told to comfort others and what it’s like to tell those stories (with truth or grief behind them) is exactly up my alley.

**Coolest format:** “[The Scientist Does Not Look Back](https://escapepod.org/2024/07/25/escape-pod-951-the-scientist-does-not-look-back/)” by Kristen Koopman (Escape Pod)

This story is told in the form of an audio lab notebook by a desperate scientist trying to revive his dead husband. This format does a brilliant job of conveying both the experimental journey and the emotions of trying to do the impossible– I was hooked. 

# Methods and observations

* My favorite way to achieve variety was resolving not to repeat any author or venue in the same streak of five stories (except for reading *Lost Places* by Sarah Pinsker, which of course gave me a higher proportion of her work). That pulled me out of my comfort zone and really encouraged me to try new venues.
* I read about twenty flash pieces in the interest of being open-minded. It’s still rarely my preferred format, but I’ll keep trying occasionally. In general, longer flash (closer to the upper line of 1500 words) clicks better for me than extra-short pieces. 
* Most of my reading in August was short stories or flash, with very few novelettes in the mix: I need to find a better reading slot for those.
* Adding the checklist item to read a few short stories my daily to-do list helped more than anything else I’ve tried. Just getting in the rhythm of squeezing short stories into the day made the to-read pile less intimidating.
* I drew recommendations from all over, including the Short Fiction Book Club monthly discussions, reviewer roundups, the Wyrmhole newsletter, and assorted Twitter or Bluesky posts. I also just clicked through back issues of magazines and selected intriguing titles. So far, the most reliable hits came from the SFBC crowd, but I'd love to find more reviewer sources: digging through those posts has led me to magazines that I wouldn't have found otherwise.
* I’m a mood reader, so I didn’t have a plan or order when deciding what to read next except when I was reading for SFBC sessions. Instead, I keep opening more tabs in my short story window and then pulling one out based largely on whim: a cool title, a new magazine, roughly the right wordcount for the length of my current break, and so on. This is a terrible system, and I do not recommend it to anyone. However, I plan to continue doing it indefinitely. 

Will I read this many short fiction pieces in a month again? I’m not sure, and September is off to a less-than-stellar start thanks to work and travel, but this was a great experiment in casting a wide net. 

Questions? Suggestions? Recommendations for the tab hoard, especially psychological horror (for a reason yet to be revealed)? Please share.",fantasy
Lord Dunsany or Tolkien?,"For those who have read both, who do you prefer and why?

I grew up with Tolkien which was my first real introduction to fantasy, but recently discovered Lord Dunsany (who predated and was read by Tolkien I believe), which I absolutely loved. I’m surprised Dunsany isn’t more popular and widely read.

I found Dunsany’s short stories to be more full of wonder, poetic, and dreamlike than Tolkien’s writing.

Three short reviews of recently read books,"Hi.

**The Hexologists** - Josiah Bancroft

I originally received an ARC but ultimately finished it via audiobook purchased myself. I'm sad to say I was personally disappointed. However, don't take this as an anti-rec because this was a case of the book just not being for me. The craftsmanship and attention to detail in the writing was wonderful. Bancroft, in my opinion, really knows how to craft some excellent sentences in both meaning but also in how the literal sounds flow together. Honestly, there's some fantastic wordplay going on. I also thought the idea of the plot and characters was very creative, and a husband/wife duo isn't a pair of protagonists I often see in fantasy. It's the execution that didn't land for me. And honestly, I think it's because it felt sort of like an old-fashioned detective novel, and I just don't care for that style. To me it read as very stiff and detached. I would still recommend that others give it a try, though, because they might be able to connect to it better than I could. I *might* continue on with the series. I was a big fan of the Books of Babel.

  
**The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl, Book 6** - Matt Dinniman

This was the first book in the series I read, and before anyone comes for me, I do this on a regular basis and have no problems enjoying the books. After hearing many great things about how this was such a great litRPG series and one that really stood out, I...was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it was incredibly readable. For a decently long book, I felt that I got through it pretty quickly. Each character was well developed, albeit some were more annoying than others. And the pacing kept things moving but not rushed. 

But I just found some of the humor to be pretty juvenile and not my cup of tea, personally. It went from fun and silly to obnoxious pretty fast. I found a lot of the real life references shoehorned in and unnecessary, especially the bit about how with autotune, ""people who couldn't sing before, like Kesha and T-Pain, could finally have a career in music,"" which isn't how autotune works; and what a weird dig to have today when both artists have shown that they...can sing. But let's say that's just the game's AI being its snarky self. I hated that character; maybe I was supposed to. But I didn't find its meta-commentary on RPG items, quests, etc. to be enjoyable in the slightest. I think the majority of the comments it made would've landed much better had they been played straight as thoughts from Carl or comments from one of his companions. 

So yeah, I wasn't a fan. I think the overall style and humor just didn't land for me. While I can see why it's so beloved, I don't think it's for me and won't be checking out the other books.

**Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang** - Kate Wilhelm

What a wild ride of a book. I liked this more than I thought I would and found it both engaging and thought-provoking. It's a dystopian book that I think has stood the test of time and one I would recommend others read. I don't have much else to say about it, but it was probably my favorite out of these three books.

Political Fantasy?,"Looking for more books along the lines of the Dune series, where the political intrigue is front and center, with really well-developed characters. George RR Martin and Daniel Abrahams both are sort of along the same lines, but neither one captured the same feeling of mystery and intrigue for me. Daniel Abrahams describes his work as ""economic fantasy,"" so I think I'm looking for ""political fantasy.""

Edit: I think the secret sauce for me with Dune, was the vivid world, and the colorful, distinctive characters. A lot of the other books with political elements that I've tried to read have lacked that page-turning unexpectedness.

Edit #2: I'm not specifically looking for sci fi. I'm one of those people who considers Dune more fantasy than sci fi, when you really consider its elements.",fantasy
What's your opinion about other species than human in fantasy ?,"Hello !

I already asked you a few days ago what your ideal book was, and now I'd like to ask you another question, again out of pure curiosity. Let's say you're reading a fantasy book. No matter the type of story or the world. Could be medieval, scifi, modern, doesn't matter. But this applies mostly to medieval fantasy of course. Do you like other species ? Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Orcs, etc or do you prefer a more human world ?

World-Spanning Quest Adventures... and Dungeons!,What are some multi-book series in similar style to Riyria Chronicles or Black Tongue Thief.

Going into deep dungeons would be an awesome bonus too!,fantasy
What 1st novels in a series are still great to read as standalone books?,"Time is precious, sometimes you just want to dip your toes in.

I've read all the Gentlemen Bastards books out so far, but Lies of Locke Lamora is a very good standalone novel.",fantasy
What are your picks for the best PLOT driven books you've read?,"So I'm an ASOIAF fan, and upon suggestions from a LOTTT of people in this sub, the next best book series that gives me the same level of grimdark, complex characters and engaging story was destined to be the First Law, so I read book 1.

I love almost everything about ASOIAF, the worldbuilding, the plot, the characters, everything I consider to be some of the best I've ever read. However, while I adored the characters in The Blade Itself (especially the main 3 leads), the plot just didn't pick up at all, and from what I've read about the series, while the characters are insanely good, the plot is not the highlight for the entire length of these books.

The same apparently goes for other series like Realm of the Elderlings and such. Are there no authors that can pull off VERY well written and engaging plots like GRRM does? And one that preferably doesn't sacrifice on other aspects as well? like I love Tyrion and Jon Snow as much as I love Glokta and Logen, I don't particularly want inferior characters for an superior plot.",fantasy
Books following a sorceress/mage,"I've just finished a re-read of *A Practical Guide to Sorcery* (well, to the current chapter) and want more of that so I hope someone here has some suggestions. I've read (or am current with) *Memoirs of Your Local Small-time Villainess*, *The Calamitous Bob*, *Beneath the Dragoneye Moons*, *Abhorsen* (which I didn't like) and probably a few more that I don't remember right now.

MC should be female and more sorceress/mage than something like a witch (eg. *Uprooted* wouldn't quite fit, but if nothing else is around I'll take that too). Preferrably *no* LitRPGs, or if it has to be one it should spend as few time on those elements as possible.

Setting is preferrably medieval, but modern is okay too - but under no circumstances Victorian England. Romance is okay/preferred as long as the sorcery/magecraft aspect is more important in the greater narrative - in fact I'm kinda burnt out on asexual MCs at the moment, so if there is at least an acknowledgement that women can be interested in both sexual relationships and using their brains that'd be awesome. F/F relationships preferred, but F/M is okay.

Thanks in advance!",fantasy

Epic fantasy series with the most deep/complex world building?,"I'm looking for series with a really complex/lived-in world, preferably large and deep. 

The best examples of world-building I have found are Middle-Earth, Wheel of Time, Malazan, and ASOIAF.

I'd rank Cosmere just below but it's pretty great too.

Are there any other fantasy series that can compete with the above when it comes to depth and complexity of world-building?",fantasy
Looking for recommendations on what to read next,"First time posting and I really hope someone can help me out.

Rn I'm feeling like I've already read many of the best series out there + some others, though I'm refusing to believe this to be true so I'm looking for recommendations.

I'm mainly looking for some kind of series, trilogy or longer, preferably with magic in a medieval setting. It doesn't have to be a series, but I am looking for something to pique my interest and keep me busy for a while, while eagerly awaiting the continuation of a few of the series mentioned below. 

Political intrigue is very welcome while plots centered on romance/with a lot of sexual content is not what I'm looking for. Grimdark is nice but preferably no YA/romantic, though some of the books I've enjoyed previously could be described as YA-adjacent at the least. 
I'm not picky about the gender of the protagonist, whether there are dragons or gods, or the magic system.
Several POVs is fine though I often find myself longing to read about the other characters when POVs switch (a great example being in ASOIAF; an entire book and only a few chapters with Arya - it was all I could think about while reading the other POVs, so frustrating!). 


Previously I've enjoyed (in no particular order):

LOTR

The Riftwar Cycle by Raymond E. Feist

Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson (found Mistborn ok, liked Wax and Wayne)

The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik (also enjoyed Uprooted and Spinning silver but the scholomance trilogy not as much)

Sorcerer Royale series by Zen Cho

The Hythrun chronicles by Jennifer Fallon

The Witches of Eileanan by Kate Forsyth

Everything written by Trudi Canavan

Honourable mentions: 
ASOIAF and Realm of the Elderlings. They varied between 3-5/5 for me, depending on which book in the series we're talking about. Also the Bloodsworn saga by John Gwynne which grew on me by the end of the first book, though it's not exactly the medieval setting I'm looking for, I did enjoy it.

I've recently started reading The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie and I'm about 15% in but haven't decided if I like it yet, maybe I'm just being picky starting something new or still waiting for the magic to really kick in, idk. 

Would really appreciate some recommendations, and I'm excited to learn what other readers have enjoyed!

"Any suggestions books that are dark fantasy with surreal, horror, and melancholic elements with mysterious worldbuilding.","Look for books similar to the art project that is Vermis. Which has a lot of elements I listed in the title, I'd described it as something similar to Fear and Hunger or Berserk with an underlying theme of profound sadness with some surreal and lovecraftian horror elements added in. 

I've read Gormenghast which fits pretty well, and tried to read Book of the New Sun but it just didn't click with me. Labyrinth the movie is also a similar vibe.

"Cover Reveal: Kate Elliott's The Witch Roads, releasing June 2025, ""the book that reignited my love of writing during a rough period when I wondered if I should just quit.""", ,fantasy
Looking for strong female characters? Looking for incredible world building? Female author in fantasy? Kate Elliott is your author.,"I'm not usually a poster but I feel this post is timely, especially with a lot of the requests I've seen lately.

Kate Elliott's 'Crown of Stars' 7 book sequence is some of the best fantasy I have ever read. While the first book has a strong medieval inspiration, the following books explore stranger aspects of the world and push tangents.

The central characters are incredibly well written, their arcs are detailed, tragic and hopeful. Some of the themes that Elliott explores are decades ahead of what was being written at the time. The creatures are strange, intriguing and the motives of some are undeniably alien.

I can still remember my thoughts after reading the very first book in the series. ""Well, hitmahip, there's no point being an author because you'll never write anything as good as this."" That may seem a little melodramatic but it was simply that good, and I was that awed by her writing.

That book is the only time I've ever had this reaction.

Her ""Spirit Walker"" series is also fantastic. Her most recent work (The Sun Chronicles) is a re-imagining of Alexander the Great, gone to space. It's not my favourite of hers as I feel there's some unevenness in the tone of some of the character POVs, but still fantastic world building.

Kate Elliott is one of the best authors in this field, and I don't see much discussion of her here. If you haven't had a chance to check out her work you absolutely should, because it stomps.

Book of the New Sun - Severian and Jolenta,"So, I am little more than halfway through The Claw of the Conciliator and I just got past the part where &gt;!Severian essentially rapes Jolenta!&lt; and I gotta say, I'm pretty pissed off about it. Obviously the guy isn't a saint but what the shit, man? I'm not even sure that I want to keep going because that seems so out of left field for what we are doing in the story currently. Not to mention we spent the entire first half of the book with him talking about how much he missed Dorcas and then all of sudden he takes advantage of a sleeping woman, and then immediately acknowledges that the only man she'd ever fully willingly give herself to was one of their traveling companions, so he knew she didn't want it even if she weren't passed out.

Character-Driven Dark Academia: A Review of The Two Doctors Górski by Isaac Fellman," *This review can also be found* [*on my blog.*](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/09/10/fantasy-novella-review-the-two-doctors-gorski-by-isaac-fellman/) 

*The Two Doctors Górski* by Isaac Fellman had a few strong reviews when it came out in 2022, but the overall mixed bag from reviewers and my spotty history when it comes to theme-heavy, plot-light stories saw me passing it up at the time. However, my themed Bingo card for this year requires a Dark Academia at a supernatural school, and given that I’d already read many of the obvious choices, it seemed an excellent opportunity to try out an intriguing work that I’d previously passed over. 

*The Two Doctors Górski* takes place in a fictional British university where the lead is enrolled for graduate work in magic, with a focus on magical psychology. Her work on rats had gained her some acclaim early in her academic career, but a disastrous romance with her advisor left her blackballed, with her only option for continuing her academic career being to study under the titular Doctor Górski, acclaimed for his academic prowess but avoided—by any who have other options—for his terrible behavior both inside and outside the classroom. 

I came into the novella expecting a plot-light portrait of academic abuse, and while the academic abuse is on full display, I’m not sure “plot-light” is the right characterization. There are plenty of seismic plot developments that radically alter the course of the story, such that it feels too plotty to be called a character study. But the major happenings never feel like they get enough support, either in the buildup or in the aftermath, leaving the pacing feeling inconsistent and preventing some of the major shifts from having the emotional impact that they probably ought to. 

But the portraits of toxicity in academia are on point, and there are some truly tremendous passages that wonderfully establish characters and their flaws. The lead’s romance is all backstory, but the abuses of power on the part of her former advisor are clear as day. The shiny, new advisor may not take advantage in quite the same way, but he’s a bitter old man whose inability to move past his own shortcomings make life miserable for all in his vicinity. His psychological commentary gives a depth both to his character and the themes of the novel, and his biting sarcasm is often hilarious—I honestly did not come into this book expecting to laugh out loud, but I did—but it’s all undone by the elements of his character he has so studiously excised and Is unwilling to build again. 

It can seem as though the lead is an entirely passive character, being passed between horrible advisors merely because that’s the path she has chosen and she can’t fathom another way. And there’s some truth to that, but the ways in which her research and her environments shape her do build a significant character arc. It’s not one I find especially satisfying, but the more I reflect after reading, the more I feel that’s the point. *The Two Doctors Górski* is a slow-moving tragedy as much as anything. 

Overall, it is a little bit of a mixed bag, as the pacing is jerky in a way that truly detracts from the overall package. But the portrait of the various kinds of dysfunction and abuse found in academia is really fantastic, and it’s a book that’s littered with tremendous passages. And if the ending may be a bit dissatisfying in the moment, it’s one that—at least for me—felt more and more powerful the more I thought about it. The pacing is a big enough drawback to put a cap on how highly I think of this one, but it’s a book that has me going back and raising the score after a couple weeks to think on it. 

*Recommended if you like*: theme-driven stories, everyone being terrible, academic settings. 

*Can I use it for* [*Bingo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bt4iqf/official_rfantasy_2024_book_bingo_challenge/)*?* It's hard mode for Character with a Disability if you count neurodivergence, and is also hard mode for Set in a Small Town. It also has a Prologue or Epilogue and is Dark Academia. 

*Overall rating:* 16 of Tar Vol’s 20. Four stars on Goodreads. ",fantasy

Whatever Happened to the Census?,"Over the last few weeks I have seen some discussion here and in other Fantasy subs about how this sub is less welcoming for women fans and less receptive to works by women authors.

Why haven’t we had a survey for the last four years? I’m really curious if the post pandemic rise of reading as a hobby, especially younger women, has changed the sub demographics.

Difference between space fantasy and sword &amp; planet?,"I know fantasy has many, many subgenres, but I was wondering what are the differences, if any, between space fantasy and sword &amp; planet. I feel there must be some, but I cannot really define them. Perhaps there is someone who has more knowledge on the subject?",fantasy
Fantasy book series where there is magic but conventional medieval tech/weapons are still relevant enough in combat and other aspects like somewhere midway between low fantasy and high fantasy. Preferably with enough worldbuilding regarding politics and life of people within the setting,"So i'm looking for like a *Mid fantasy* HEH. Ok jokes aside

I want some book where a magic user is relevant but isnt like a continent warping god and neither can they just kill an entire army or even a group of soldiers like nothing.

 And where a magic user is still in danger to a mob of peasant. Where a magic user can still die to a well-placed knife and/or arrow.

**GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS**

1. **Benjamin Ashwood** - the best example i know. Anybody like anybody can be overwhelmed by numbers even those long lived mages and nonmage fighters. Seriously even mages can be beaten by a non-magic user just cause you can train your mind against it. Nobody is invincible and a single blade is as relevant as a single mage. Mages are easily tired and not easily trained. A mage can die to a peasant just as much as a trained warrior in the right timing.
2. **Codex Alera** - when everybody has magic well nobody is special. Even the ""Lords"" of the series aka the best fighters in the show can be overrun by numbers and just tactics. I appreciate it even more as they operate as groups in combat just cause how one cant carry everybody and can easily die to a lethal hit

  
**SERIES THAT DONT FIT WHAT IM LOOKING FOR**

1. **Stormlight Archives** - I'll be honest this series is why I posted this. Dont get me wrong I love Stormlight Archives but I still have lingering disappointment on how big the leap is between the first book and the 2nd book. It went from army tactics with super armor who can still get overwhelmed by numbers to people straightup doing superman fly and infinite healing.  The infinite healing really killed any suspense vs regular troops who dont have special powers as well
2. **Wheel of Time -** one regular channeler can pretty much kill 100 people easily and none of them could even get close. 
3. **Malazan -** some beings in this series are just too powerful. Regular fighters are both relevant and useless here.

I am in a fantasy reading drought. Hopefully there is a recommendation that hits the spot here and get me back on my reading mood of fantasy

Any recommendations ? Thanks.",fantasy

Six Of Crows &amp; Crooked Kingdom: An Honest Review,"(Disclaimer: My review contains a lot of spoilers for the two books along with the original Shadow &amp; Bone Trilogy)

Despite its many flaws and simplicity compared to some other fantasy series, the original Shadow &amp; Bone trilogy was something I enjoyed immensely. I think this is in part due to the fact the circumstances in which I read the first book as it was lent to me by someone very dear to me in the worst period of my life who I have now lost and because I hadn't really read much fantasy by the time I picked up the trilogy and finished it two years after I first read Shadow &amp; Bone.

So my expectations going into the Six Of Crows duology was sky high. Every single review I read praised and every fan of the Grishaverse always raved about the two books and how much better the duology was compared to the original trilogy. I think is really harmed my perception of the book going into the books as I expected the best thing since \*insert what ever great fantasy author you want\*. However, that was unfortunately not what I received.

One of the biggest problems, in my opinion, with the two books was the prose or writing style that the author used. There wasn't a single word I could not understand, nor was there a single phrase, sentence or idiom that confused me and it wasn't particularly flowery or poetic. Yet I found it very hard to follow for some reason. It just wasn't able to suck me into the world nor was it able to truly activate my imagination unlike the other the original trilogy which was extremely simple yet effective. Another problem I have with the writing style was how we had different POVs for each character yet there was no personality in any of them. Even though we are looking through the eyes of a single character (even though it is technically third person), I feel like we don't get enough of the character's thought processes and monologues.

However, the books' biggest flaw is without a doubt, the characters. The fandom absolutely adores the main cast yet I cannot help but feel like a lot of that love has to do with how they were depicted in the TV show which I haven't watched yet. To be frank, the characters felt like colourful and vibrant cardboard cutouts. I think that's the best way to put it. They seem really cool and interesting when you take a glance but they ultimately feel two dimensional at best.

Jesper and Wylan were without a doubt the most boring and uninteresting characters in the first book. There was so little information about the two of them, even if Jesper had a lot of chapters (while Wylan had none), they were the least compelling characters and I could not find myself growing attached to them at all. Wylan was just bland, boring and there really isn't much to say about him because of how little screen (or page) time he had. Jesper being boring and uninteresting was really fascinating given how flamboyantly he is presented and with how many chapters he had. However, they had the biggest glow up in the second book out of any of the cast with Wylan easily becoming the most interesting character in the second book for me. Jesper also became a lot more interesting but not nearly as much Wylan or some of the other characters.

Inej was one of the more compelling characters in the first book. I could place her in second or third in terms of my favourite characters. It was clear to see how much her trauma has affected her and she was a pretty vibrant and interesting character, especially at the beginning. However, she became a lot more boring to me in the second book. I didn't look forward to reading her POV characters as much as I did in the first book.

I hated Nina when she was first introduced. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as I still think she was interesting and didn't feel like putting the book down when her chapters came around but before her whole backstory was explained, she felt extremely vapid and bitchy but I really grew to love her by the end of the first book and continued to like her in the second book.

Despite being the most controversial and disliked character in the main cast, Matthias was without a doubt my favourite character. He is the most compelling and his character arc, while extremely rushed, was the only one I felt was truly satisfying in the first book. His POV was the only one I truly looked forward and was genuinely happy to find when it came around. I connected with him a lot more than I did any other character. However, while he continued to be great in the second book, there wasn't much of an arc or character development for him to be had. But I still feel pissed off at his death because it was so pointless. I felt like his death was added in, purely for the shock factor and does serve to further the plot or improve the story in any way. I can only hope the KoS duology does Nina's development due to his death justice.

Kaz seems to be the fan favourite character in the fandom. But I have to say, Kaz was without a doubt, the least interesting and compelling character in the main cast. He oozed edge and felt like a badly written OC. He feels like Naruto in one of those fics where the village hates him or his parents neglect him or both and he becomes super angry, edgy, cold and hypercompetent. One of the biggest problems or flaws when it came to the execution of Kaz Brekker's character was that he didn't feel smart. He didn't truly feel like he was two steps ahead of everyone despite the narrative being written in such a way that he was, in fact, two steps ahead of everyone. Every character around him and all opposition he faced feel dumbed down just to make him look smarter. It feels like the author tried to balance his asshole-ishness with a dash of wit which ultimately makes him even more obnoxious and unlikeable.

Now, talking about the books and the plot itself, I have to say that while the concept of books themselves are fun, they aren't really that well executed. None of the big plot twists and reveals really shocked me, even though I was actively trying to not predict them. There were moments in the two books (beginning of Six Of Crows and middle part of Crooked Kingdom) where I felt like reading the books were a chore.

But who would I recommend it to?

Certainly not a veteran of fantasy. However, if you are a YA fan, a fan of the Shadow &amp; Bone TV series or someone looking to get into reading books in general, I can certainly recommend it to them.

Six Of Crows: 7/10

Crooked Kingdom: 5/10

Dragon Wing (Death Gate Cycle #1) Review,"This is book #1 in The Death Gate Cycle, an epic fantasy series set in Tolkienesque world inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves and two unique demigod like races - the Patryns and the Sartan. 



The Patryns and Sartan were long in conflict, until the Sartan split the Earth into four elemental realms, imprisoning the Patryns in a fifth prison world, the Labyrinth.



The series starts with a Patryn named Haplo, who escaped the Labyrinth and is now set to explore the four worlds, in preparation to the Patryns return.



The world building is the book’s main strength, it is set in the world of air - Arianus, a world  divided into three layers - the high realm is inhabited by powerful human sorcerers, the middle realm is composed of floating islands and is traveled either by airships (in the case of the elves) or by tamed dragons (in the case of the humans), finally, the low realm is inhabited by the dwarves who toil operating a giant machine called the Kicksey-winsey, the machine’s true function is unknown, but it produces large amounts of water, a resource so precious it is used as currency in the rest of Arianus.



To my surprise, the writing, while by no means exceptional, is still quite a few notches better than the writing of many of today’s popular series. I would suggest aspiring authors to look at this series if they’re trying to write simple and functional prose without losing too much quality. 



The characters are also well realized, in addition to the Cold, brooding Haplo, we follow Hugh, a skilled assassin who, to his own surprise, still has a heart, Limbeck, a curious dwarven maverick turned reluctant revolutionary, and Alfred, a seemingly clumsy servant who hides a terrible secret.



The story is pretty standard high fantasy stuff, but still manages to take several unexpected twists and turns.



In summary, this series, while seeming at first to be standard Tolkien inspired fantasy, actually contains many original and well realized elements, underrated and highly recommended. ",fantasy

"Hi, r/fantasy. I'm Amy Leow, author of The Scarlet Throne. AMA!","Hi everyone, I'm Amy Leow (pronounced Lee-ow)! The first novel in my debut fantasy trilogy, THE SCARLET THRONE, is out today with [Orbit US](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/amy-leow/the-scarlet-throne/9780316562485/?lens=orbit) and will be out with [Orbit UK](https://store.orbit-books.co.uk/products/the-scarlet-throne) on September 12th.

THE SCARLET THRONE is a dark, political epic fantasy that follows the story of Binsa, a “living goddess” chosen by the gods to dispense both mercy and punishment on her people. But rather than channeling the wisdom of an immortal deity, she harbors a demon. When her priests decide that her time as a goddess must come to an end, she strikes a new deal with the demon inside her to hold on to power for as long as possible—even if she must trade her humanity to do so.

First and foremost, this book was written as a love letter to evil female characters, who in my opinion should be allowed to win sometimes. It is also an exploration of what really makes us human, and the lengths we all go to to achieve our goals.

You can expect this in THE SCARLET THRONE:

* a (seriously) morally gray cast
* a talking cat
* and falling goats

Asides from writing novels, I enjoy playing badminton (the indoor court version, not the sacrilegious lawn sport), overdosing myself on coffee, and watching anime. I'm also doing a PhD in Applied Linguistics, though I feel like the more I study about languages the less I know about them.

I can be found across my [website](https://www.amyleowwrites.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/amyleow_writes/), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/LeowAmy), [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@amyleow_writes), and am a lurker on Reddit. Since I'm operating from Malaysia, which is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, I'll try to answer as many questions as I can before I sleep and answer everything else in the morning.

Looking forward to your questions!

Bingo Review: Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi,"Bingo Categories:

* Dreams (Hard Mode)
* Published in 2024
* Character with a Disability &gt;!(Hard Mode) !&lt;
* Cover I liked
* Eldritch Creatures- Maybe. Dragons in this setting and otherworldly and weird, but might be too commonplace in fantasy to count. **Hard Mode** if they do.

In the city-state of Navola, commerce, secrets, and promises are power, and the di Regulai family holds sway over all three. Their banking empire trumps armies and kingdoms, but its next generation sits on shaky ground. Davico, the heir to said empire, is soft-hearted, possessing little of the ruthlessness or drive to take over the family business. He's interested in the beauty of nature and the enthralling charms of the petrified dragon eye sitting on his father's desk. But the weight and greed of power care little for Davico's desires, and he finds himself inexorably drawn into his family's web of schemes, ambition, and violence.

*Navola* is a twisty, lush, and at times, incredibly vicious book. It's at its heart, a very character-driven one though. We spend the entire book in Davico's head (only interrupted by occasional interludes from in-universe folk tales). Bacculpi does an excellent job of painting him as a sympathetic, albeit totally naive protagonist. I'm typically annoyed with such characters, but Davico's blend of empathy and general confusion at the political wheeling and dealing helps ground the reader in a complex setting. *Navola*'s strongest element is Davico's character development in general, with Bacculpi not taking the easy route and simply making Davico more ruthless as he matures. Instead, his growth is a combination ofgrowing political acumen and his ""softer"" understanding of the world. The book's theme of family legacy, and how it can shape and control is perfectly realized in Davico.

He's also surrounded by a variety of interesting side characters. His adopted sister, Cecelia goes beyond the ""manic pixie dream girl"" trope I feared she initially was, becoming a pretty stark look at what it takes to survive in a patriarchal society. Cazzetta, the di Regulai's personal assassin, is a twisted mentor figure who gets some of the book's most memorable lines.



&gt;""You are alone. No one loves you. You probably poisoned your own mother.""

&gt;

&gt;**""If I poisoned my mother, I assure you that she never saw it coming""**

I heard some criticisms of the pacing of *Navola* as slow, but I don't agree with this. I would say it's more *steady*throughout, with Bacigalupi layering the plot with enough intrigue and red herrings to keep me guessing where things were going. And when *Navola* gets intense it really goes for it. The last third was shockingly dark, violent, and compared to what came before, cruel. Some readers may be turned off by this, but it felt like a natural conclusion to just how ruthless and uncompromising the setting is portrayed. 

*Navola* is hands down one of the best books I've read this year. If it weren't for Kristoff's *Empire of the Damned*, I would say that it would take the top spot, and even then it's a tight race.

How do you all feel about fantasy with/without magic or supernatural elements?,"I was recently reading goodreads reviews a Priory of Orange Tree and I saw a few complaints that the book focused more on politics than ""fantasy elements"" like magic or the dragons etc ... which made me wonder that is an actual preference people have?

Is that a deal breaker or a point of disappointment for readers if the fantasy world doesn't have magic? Should fantasy ideally feature something supernatural?

I personally don't require magic or supernatural elements to enjoy a fantasy story. I think i would still have liked GoT without the dragons and white walkers etc ... since the politics and character development itself was intriguing. Maybe it's because I'm a history enthusiast just for the fun of it. So, just tell me a story with kings and queens and knights and high stakes politics and war and I am in (as long as it is interesting of course).

I'm also just interested in an author's ability to invent whole worlds and societies, and of course the stranger and more different from our world, the better, but not necessarily supernatural.

Series recommendation with complex and unique worldbuilding,"You know, the thing i really love in fantasy is a worldbuilding. So, could you please recommend good series with good worldbuilding which fit next criterias:

1. It's big and complex, i don't mind to dig in a bit. Good example -  SA by Brandon Sanderson.

2. It's unique, cause i've read enough generic medieval settings, or some derivatives from real world cultures like ASOIAF or Memory, Sorrow and Thorn (don't misunderstand, i love both series, but now i want to read something a bit more unique). Good example would be the same as above i guess.

3. The worldbuilding should have impact on the story, cause authors often just don't give a cake about that and their plot could perfectly exist even without all that quirky world rules. Good example of that is Books of Babel by Josiah Bancroft, because the Babel Tower is not only unique and interesting world, but it also closely coupled with plot.

4. I don't like 'fluffy' fantasy. I'm not asking for a grimdark specifically, cause you know, these is a whole gradient between these two points, i just don't like fantasy where is no drama, no tensions, no conflicts and everyone behave like they came from modern NY. Or the opposite case, when author is trying to be BRUTAL, filling the book with unnecessary and often illogical violence, just to make it more violent, but people still behave like they live on the XXI century earth with the long tradition of humanism. Good example would be TES 3: Morrowind - not a book, but it's magnificent, though. It's not grimdark, but so much filled with different internal politics and conflicts, so you're not bored to go through it.

P.S. Please don't recommend WoT (tried it three times, never got farther, than 3rd books) and Malazan (tried two times and DNF at the first book, just not my thing).

P.P.S. Please, avoid recommending the next genres: YA, romantasy, LitRPG, progression fantasy, cozy fantasy.

Is there a fantasy book with classic necromancy?,"The term *necromancy* itself comes from the Greek words *nekros* (meaning ""dead body"") and *manteia* (meaning ""divination"").

The original meaning of the word wasn't to bring the dead back as minions or to restore life as it is today in pop culture, but it was a form of divination using the dead as a medium to see the future.

It was thought in ancient cultures, particularly Greco-Roman, that the afterlife was a realm beyond time and the souls which have crossed over could see the past, present and future from it. So the purpose of necromantic rituals was to summon a dead soul to ask for wisdom and future prophecies. Also, typically the practitioner couldn't compel the soul to share that knowledge, the dead had to be willing.",fantasy

I recently tried the First Law series and I don’t feel the hook at all (I don’t mean that as a reflection on the books, more my own inability to get drawn in).

The Dragonbone Chair- a very long review ,"My thoughts during:

Part 1- Simon Mooncalf

There are two types of fantasy books, ones that entertain you and ones that transport you and The Dragonbone Chair is one that transported me to the lands of Osten Ard. The only other series I can compare the book so far two are Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time and if you’re in the company of wheel of time in my mind, you’re in very good company. 

I mean the level of depth there seems to be when it comes to this world is crazy and I really appreciate that Willam’s has the ability to make me want to read a book that is this slow because it is slow as you guys have said. That slowness however is not a fault but rather a virtue because you basically get to live and breathe in hayholt like Simon. 

The prose, perhaps my favorite I’ve come across really lends itself to the world as well. It somehow finds a balance between modern and archaic language without ever being too much of either. The descriptions of thing and what they’re compared to paint such a clear picture and you can practically see exactly what Willam’s is trying to depict. 
I also think the the intrigue with the castle politics so far has been great, and I’m hoping to learn more information about why our King would even want to hang around these very obviously evil dude besides a badass sword. I think there’s a lot going on we aren’t in the loop about yet.The lore is also very drop. I will also add the I think the last few chapters of part 1 are pretty much a perfect set up to hook the reader for the long wrong, especially the last part where what I believe the evil Sithi and King are shown. Excellent stuff thus far and looking forward to more.

Simon however is just kind of a bumbling idiot.. unfortunately other pov characters haven’t really had enough time to be characters yet but I’m sure as this book and series goes on, I’ll grow more attached to the cast.


Part 2- Simon Pilgrim

Much like the beginning of part 1 this section begins on the slower side and yet that is not by any means a fault because when the action or political intrigue happens, I’m so sucked into the world that it literally gets my heart racing. Just watching the King talk to one of his advisors to me was genuinely a really good time and I was so into the conversation they were having, I couldn’t believe it. I also loved the introduction and continual friends of Binabik, he’s so great and if he dies I will riot. Simon is finally if very slowly becoming a man and his determination during the last chapter to save Binabik was admirable. I also find that the creatures that shows up during this section was pretty awesome form the diggers to the gaint, I just love when authors really tie you the fantasy creatures. Overall I really enjoyed this chapter, I thought there was bit more action this time around and some interesting character development, interactions and introductions. 

Part 3- Simon Snowcloack

I just really love how this section opens up with all of these characters coming together and just discussing what they should do next. The worldbuilding and lore here I think works very well, and for some it may come off as just info dumping but to me I really enjoy just listening to the history of the world. I also think that dialogue is the best on display so far  when it comes to the planning and politicking of how Josua and his allies should approach Elias and the storm king threat. 

We finally see our first actual battle and man Willams certainly dosent hold back on a making it a confusing, and bloody mess which is exactly what a battle must be like. The description at this point when Josua and his men of Naglimund fall into the trap is amazing, and even though I saw coming, it was still a great moment. I really like how Willam’s balances the tone in this book between the classical fantasy feeling when it comes to the slower, less action pact parts and then when the action does kick off he goes more modern and doesn’t hesitate to make it dark and vivid. 
 
Simon finally mans up and takes on the goddamn dragon with thorn. Shit was goated. I feel like Tad is just absolutely flexing in this final section how good of an author he is. Like the characterization is better than ever, the action is awesome, the dialogue is cranked up and the prose is just off the charts. Every scene is dripping with just perfect clarity because of the prose and Wincott is really taking his performance to another level. 

Me the entire siege- Holy shit this got so dark, Willam’s is the goat. 

now Simon is marked!


Review-

A Living Breathing World:
There are two types of fantasy books, ones that entertain you and ones that transport you and The Dragonbone Chair is one that has transported me to the lands of Osten Ard. The only other series I can compare this book to is  TheWheel of Time and if you’re in the company of Wheel of Time well you are something special indeed.
The level of depth there seems to be when it comes to this world is crazy and I really appreciate that Willam’s has the ability to make me want to read a book that is this slow because that’s not something I necessarily enjoy. Still the slowness however is not a fault but rather a virtue because you basically get to live and breathe in the world like Simon and the other characters 

Prose:
The prose, perhaps my favorite I’ve come across really lends itself to the world as well. It somehow finds a balance between modern and archaic language without ever being too much of either. The descriptions of thing and what they’re compared to paint such a clear picture and you can practically see exactly what Willam’s is trying to depict. 

Characters:
I think the Dragonbone chair takes it sweet time when it comes to developing it’s characters but man it really pays off because by the end you get this beautiful journey as you see Simon slowly become a man over the course of the book. He’s perhaps one of the best realized teenage protagonists I’ve read, not my favorite necessarily but a very real one I could have related to more when I was his age. The rest of the cast are no slouches either because Willam’s really gives everyone, even non-pov characters a distinctive voice that I find few authors can achieve. SO the characters are very well done in my eyes.

Dialogue:
I mean what can I say here? It’s brilliant, from the lore drops we got from certain characters to the simple political schemeing, every piece of dialogue felt so intentional and well thought especially at the book got further and further along. There were so many exchanges between characters just talking that had my heart pounding and they were just speaking!? Idk how he did it but Williams mangaed to write dialogue that just entangled me.

Action:
There isn’t a lot of action in the Dragonbone chair but man when the action begins it really stands out! This book is more about characters and dialogue and the world than just action sequences but because of that the action has a serious sense of gravity that really lends the world and what happens to it as feeling real.also Willam’s is just excellent at describing and conveying action both in a battle and a monster fight, so it’s wonderful to read!

Overall:

The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Willams is perhaps the most surprising book of the year for me. Honestly the reputation it has for being a slow burn fantasy epic really scares me because I’ve been reading a lot of fairy fast paced books and overall perfect stories that keep the plot moving forward as a run instead of a walk. Still here I am to say that The Dragonbone Chair is  perhaps the best first book in a series I’ve ever read, or at least the best since AGOT by Martin. The level of depth in this world, the prose, the characters, the pacing, the dialogue are all so well balanced in my eyes that I’m blown away by how much I enjoyed it. I mean every chapter had me wanting to read more, to get to the next thing, see the next sight and just live in the world of Osten Ard! Somehow the is incredibly slow book managed to capture my love and fascination for a fantastical world that I literally stayed up writing the longest review I’ve ever written just to sing its praises. I just adored this book and am blown away by the fact that this song better known by the fantasy community. This was excellent! 9.8/10",fantasy

"Are there any modern novels that have a ""classic feel"" to them?","When I was a kid I was a massive Eddings fan, but after learning that he abused his adopted children I can't in good conscience read his books, which were once formative to my taste in fantasy.

So are there any books that have a similar sort of vibe (tales of farm boys going on quests with wise old mentors to stop a dark lord and so on and so forth...) while being perhaps a bit more modern in their sensibilities? I'm a sucker for those ropy, tropey plots, but at the same time I feel like fantasy as a genre has rightfully moved past the point where lots of strange old assumptions were replicated from the most famous works without thought. Example - the ""rightful king"" trope is bad and it sucks and I despise it vociferously.

I've tried reading some older works from around the same time period -give or take a half century either side- but they just don't scratch the same itch. *Magician* by Raymond E. Feist and the *Conan* series of novels weren't particularly for me among others, and so I've come to the conclusion that something more modern that has those ""classic vibes"", for want of a better term, might be what I'm looking for.

Is cyberpunk noir or is cyberpunk noir its own genre?,"Much like grimdark has a ridiculous number of definitions, cyberpunk is only barely better defined. Mike Pondsmith probably came closest with ""high tech, low life"" but what that means is often nebulous. My definition is probably closer to a subgenre in ""Cyberpunk Noir"" where so many stories take the tropes of detective and crime fiction before putting them in a science fiction setting. This is mostly due to Blade Runner but also in a lot of Gibson's and other genre pioneer's stories. After all, Neuromancer is a heist story. Part of it is the fact crime stories are visceral ways of illustrating that the system has failed some segment of society and contrasts nicely with the fact cars can now fly.

It's an interesting question and perhaps why cyberpunk keeps producing content but doesn't seem like it's a thriving genre. Because people don't identify it as strongly with recent products.",fantasy

The people of Yrfrite will soon be crushed under the boots of the Royal Guard. The rebel Duke can’t stand against the might of the King’s army and the ferocity of the Breachmen. Yet someone is pulling the strings of this conflict. Soon, something will change the fight forever.

Review:

The book starts with the imminent death of the main character, Volchak.  If you have read KJ Parkers The Company, you get the idea of what a Breachman is and does. The punch through the pikes and first line of the enemy. Not something you generally survive to do many times.

He is on year 14 of the 15 years a Breachman is drafted for. Run and the Order gets you, for ""experiments"". The character Stric is of the order. A nasty one.

Kaelith, who starts as fighting against Volchak,  is a witty, clumsy but lovable rogue character 

With Volchak is Flea a small girl who’s usually too fast to get hit, and Harker is the large a warrior type, he looks out for Flea and they have a good relationship.  Others come and go but generally don't survive.

 I think this is a book for people who love battles, soldiers, and unlikely companions -   somewhat like Gemmels  Druss the Legend but darker and more violent

It is straight into the action and a bit hard to know who to cheer for, I liked both Kaelith and Volchaks gang.

Not a lot of world building in this and it's a standalone, well so far anyway. The only and only book written by this guy as yet.  I hope there is more though.

Who are your favourite mentors in fantasy literature?,"I'm keen to hear which mentors are some of people's favourites and what makes them so fascinating? 
Currently completing a piece that focuses on the role of mentors and I'd love some inspiration about different types that appeal to readers and why.

Really Long Epic Fantasy Recs,"Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive and Malazan Book Of The Fallen are probably my favourite fantasy series of all time. I grew up on Robert Jordan's WoT and then moved on to Malazan and Stormlight later in life. Adore them in different ways for what they bring to the genre. Now looking for other similar epic journeys. Please recommend other long, multibook series with great world-building and which more or less follow the same cast of characters on their epic quest. 
PS: Please no G.R.R.M or Rothfus suggestions. I prefer series that are likely to be finished even if they are ongoing :) ",fantasy
With all this talk of Dungeon Crawler Carl... What exactly is a LitRPG?,"I've heard a lot of praise about the book from this subreddit and elsewhere and it sounds interesting but I'm not sure if I'd like it because tbh I don't really understand what LitRPG is as a genre.

The Justice of Kings Plot Question,"Hey all, plot question for The Justice of Kings by Richard Swan, which I just recently finished. Something about it has been bugging me and I cannot find an answer, but it's a long book so maybe I'm just missing it? I'm hiding the question since it's a huge spoiler:  


&gt;!Do we ever learn why Fischer and/or Vogt had Lady Bauer killed? It was clear that they were blackmailing Lord Bauer into working with them by holding his daughter hostage, but I cannot figure out why they killed his wife.!&lt;

Book recommendations?,"Looking for some really good fantasy. I can't really narrow down what type I like but I'm open to any recommendations anyways. I love the genre but nothing ever catches my eyes. Some of my favourites are The School for Good and Evil, Fire and Blood, Skandar and the Unicorn Thief... I enjoyed The Extroadinaries by TJ Klune also but that was Superheroes not fantasy. I do love anything related to Peter Pan so if some books are loosely based, I can give that a try although I've read a few already...

I dis once decide to trust booktok and read First Wing and it was the worst book I've ever read tbh. So nothing like that lol. I'm okay with smut but it's preferred not really, I want more action and stuff. I'm 20 BTW for reference but the mind of a 14 year old haha.

Court intrigue with no romance as main plot?,"Hello fellow Redditors, Would you have any recommendations for a book with interesting court intrigue? If possible no romance or no main focus on romance (and for love of all holy, no heroines who become totally dumb when meeting a man). 
My beloved book on this subject is of course The Goblin Emperor, but I know it’s not easy to find something similar. My main pet peeve for most books involving a court is the fact that they mostly involve a very handsome but damage man who makes the heroine loose her wits and throw all caution and aims other than love to the wind. That makes me want to hurl the book across the room;)
All your recommendations would be very appreciated!!",fantasy
Fantasy books - points of view,"Hello!

I'm looking for some advice or just your personal preference on points of view in a novel, whether you find it annoying to have more than one point of view or if they change too much, you lose interest in the characters. 
Or do you like it when there is? For example, two chapters in one point of view and then another two chapters in the other one and then the next you go back to the original one

Would really appreciate you answering

Goodreads Book of the Month - The Book of Love - Midway Discussion,"# [The Book of Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157981682-the-book-of-love) by Kelly Link

&gt;

&gt;With them in the room is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance—and what has brought them back again. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to the terms of the bargain their music teacher proposes. They will be given a series of magical tasks; while they undertake them, they may return to their families and friends, but they can tell no one where they’ve been. In the end, there will be winners and there will be losers.

&gt;But their resurrection has attracted the notice of other supernatural figures, all with their own agendas. As Laura, Daniel, and Mo grapple with the pieces of the lives they left behind, and Laura’s sister, Susannah, attempts to reconcile what she remembers with what she fears, these mysterious others begin to arrive, engulfing their community in danger and chaos, and it becomes imperative that the teens solve the mystery of their deaths to avert a looming disaster.

"As a fantasy reader, do you feel that the greater than average length of these works is overall a strength or weakness?","There is an obvious trend of fantasy being longer in terms of raw word and page count than for example literary fiction or crime/thriller novels. There are exceptions of course, but if you look at the averages there are clear trends that are undeniable. Fantasy series are often long, sprawling epics than go on for book after book and delve into different stories and expand the world. Even standalone pieces tend to be longer than the average standalone nonfantasy book. Not only that, the average length of fantasy novels is actually getting longer with time.

Given this, would you say this is a positive trend for the genre or is hurting it? Does the high word count which allows for more world-building and expansive stories help build necessary immersion? Or is it fluff that discourages people from delving into the genre or cause people to be turned off? Would the genre benefit from more storied and series that are succinct and focus on being economical with their word count? I’m very curious to get people’s opinions on this topic.",fantasy

Book Review: Ordinary Monsters by JM Miro,"**TL;DR Review:** The *X-Men,* as written by Edgar Allen Poe. Dark, haunting, gothic, violent, and twisted in all the best ways.

https://preview.redd.it/180aij0iwsnd1.jpg?width=987&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf1442e798dfd389dbfc36a2862d0e1fd09b0f4b

**Full Review:**

I was not prepared to fall so deeply in love with *Ordinary Monsters.*

From the very first page, this book sets the tone for just how dark it’s willing to go, and has such a powerful character voice that I couldn’t help getting sucked in.

The story follows “talents”, children born with magical abilities—healing, manipulation of dust, invisibility, and more. Every one of these children have suffered in the past; all are orphaned and have led hard lives filled with trauma, abuse, neglect, and hardship. Though they are young, they are very much aged by what they’ve endured, and the result is characters that feel more mature while still being childish on occasion—a fascinating dichotomy that lends to the dark horror undertones.

The children are gathered to the Cairndale Institute, where they are sheltered, protected, and trained alongside others to use their talents. It’s evocative of the *X-Men* or *Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children—*only so, so much darker.

Because, as we come to learn, the children’s abilities all involve *death.* For example, they manipulate dead skin cells to heal, or the “dust” they control is actually dead cells from inside their bodies. 

On top of that, there is a dark, mysterious man on the hunt for one of them in particular, and he’s willing to do anything and kill anyone to get his hands on them. In fact, we see in stark detail just how dangerous he is and how little he cares for human life when he casually kills those who fail to give him what he wants.

To make matters even worse (are you sensing a theme here?), there is an undead creature, a “litch”, who is working with this dark, mysterious man to hunt the children. Unkillable, ferocious, and driven by a single purpose, he is a threat that cannot be stopped, even by the gun-slinging, ass-kicking protectors who have been sent to find and bring the talented children home.

*Ordinary Monsters* is a journey through late 1800/early 1900s America, England, and Japan, with the darkness and despair of that time period on full display. It’s got the flavor of an Edgar Allan Poe novel, deeply poetic and hauntingly beautiful, but with the grim, supernatural flair of gothic fiction.

I read through the entire first half of this (very long) book in a single sitting, because the strong narrative, powerful characters, and gothic tone had me absolutely spellbound. It is one of the most unique works of fiction I have read all year, and one I cannot recommend highly enough.

Book Bingo Completed Card for 2024,"I’ve finished my first ever Bingo Card! I always wanted to do the challenge but as a mood reader I find structured reading difficult. I’m so happy I was able to finish a card this year! I went for Hero Mode and gave every book a Goodreads review. 

If I had to pick a favorite, it would be *Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies* by Heather Fawcett. It’s a difficult choice though, as I’ve had good luck with my book picks this year. To expand to a top five I’d include: *The Magpie Lord*, *Elfquest*, *The Tainted Cup*, and *The House in the Cerulean Sea*. 

I’ve included my rating and a short blurb, and I’ve marked books that count for hard mode. Maybe y’all will find something on this list that interests you or can be added to your own bingo card.

Also marked: series or standalone, genre, publication year, indie/self published, available on Kindle Unlimited (KU), LGBT representation, and if it contains consensual sex scenes (🌶️). 

*Note: I don’t believe in wasting time reading something I don’t like, so I usually end up DNFing books I would rate 1 (hated it), and 2 (didn’t like it) stars. Every book on my card are ones that I liked enough to finish. 3 - just ok, 4 - liked it, 5- loved it.*

WTF happened to book cover art?,"Ok so I grew up in the 1990s and going into the sci-fi/fantasy section of a bookstore was great fun, and I bought a lot of books half-based on artwork alone. Maybe a bit shallow, but hey, I was a kid. I liked the fact that so many fantasy novels had pictures of something I assumed was a scene from the book on them - I didn't find out until I was an adult that half the time that wasn't the case - or some sci-fi novel with a picture of some futuristic world on the cover was actually somewhere depicted in the story. etc etc.

These days... I went into a bookshop on the weekend and *god* some people got lazy and/or cheap. There's still a bit of good ol'-fashioned sword and sorcery artwork getting around, but there's also just a lot of muted, bland, pointless cover art. 

Case in point: I read a lot of Raymond E Feist as a kid. Loved all his stuff. Lots of fantasy artwork going on. Then I got his newest book a few weeks ago, and the cover looks like AI or clipart. And I realised it's been like that with all his stuff - all his older stuff in the store the other day was just black covers with the book name and a tiny bit of artwork on them. And heaps of the fantasy was like that. For a genre that's supposedly full of imagination, looking at the book covers sure doesn't feel that way.

Also, I am most definitely talking about run-of-the-mill paperback editions here. I'm not talking about special hardcover editions that have to be ordered in and still have commissioned artwork.

Anyway, that's all. Hope you agree.",fantasy
Recommendation for good light hearted soft magic books?,"Just looking for recommendations for books that have two simple qualities

1. Light hearted/hopeful/Not too grim  
2. Has a good amount of soft magic

I honestly haven't read too much fantasy. I think this is because I am not a huge fan of 'hard magic' fantasy books like Brandon Sanderson novels. This is just my personal taste.   
  
Here are some examples of the sort of thing I have in mind: I loved the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the one Narnia book I read, His Dark Materials. I have also read the Name of the Wind and did like the 'naming' part of the magic system which is comparatively 'soft'. In other media, my favorite fantasy movies and shows include Hayao Miyazaki movies, original star wars and specifically the Empire Strikes Back. One example of a magic system that is sometimes called 'hard' but that I did like a lot was Avatar: The Last Airbender, but it felt comparatively 'soft' in actual content, especially considering things like the spirit realm, past lives, and the lion turtle. Korra felt like an extremely 'hard' magic system in comparison and I think thats why I didn't like it as much.  
  
In short, I like magic to be somewhat mysterious and difficult or impossible to understand completely.  A lot of the time, it takes the 'fantasy' out of fantasy for me personally when I can understand the magic completely (there are definitely notable exceptions to this, specifically I think manga and anime are really good at hard magic that I do enjoy, but just not in the mood for that type of thing right now)  
  
But I have trouble finding books like the ones I mentioned above. There are some examples that people cite, e.g. Song of Ice and Fire, which I do think I might enjoy eventually, but as I am a specific point in my life right now, frankly, I just want something that will lift my mood and not depress me much like the examples listed above. I don't mind if it has depressing moments, or even is rather melancholy, but a book that maintains an overall light-hearted or hopeful outlook on life would be appreciated (Hayao Miyazaki movies are often examples of melancholy movies that are still pretty light-hearted/hopeful over all).

A long series that makes you feel like home. ,"Have any of you had a series that just felt like coming home to your safe space after a bad day or when going through a rough patch in life and wanted to escape to this other world that felt like home? 

It was Harry Potter &amp; Percy Jackson for me when I was a kid, and Wheel of Time when I was a teenager. 

Now I'm an adult and need something similar and I'd love to hear what that series was for you guys! ",fantasy
Books featuring giants?,"Werewolves, Vampires, Witches and Fairies(Fae) are pretty dime-a-dozen in fantasy nowadays, but I can't think of many examples of stories featuring giants. What are some where you think it's been handled well?",fantasy
Depressed and delusional because of fantasy novels ,"I’m 28 F, grown as hell and yet I broke down sobbing yesterday because of the reality that I’ll never wake up and be an immortal magical being who spends their life questing and adventuring and saving the world. Like even if your only goal in life is to become rich, as long as you’re still alive that’s a possibility..but my dreams can never come true. I’m still a mortal human working 40 hrs a week to barely survive. Does anyone else feel like reading too much fantasy has been detrimental to their mental health like this? I’m genuinely so heart broken that I’ll never get to go on an adventure in middle earth. 


**Update** 
First of all I want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment, share your personal experiences and give advice. Thank you to everyone who reached out to me privately to check in on me and share their own struggles with this particular issue. I am okay, I’m not suicidal or anything I was just shocked at how upset it made me as an adult that life isn’t a fairytale and wanted to see if any other adults had felt this way and so many of you have/do! It does make me feel less alone and I will absolutely be applying some of the advice given here, I think so many of you hit the nail on the head as far as needing to implement some adventure into my real life as I have been stuck in a rut for quite some time.

"[Review] Jam Reads: New York Minute, by Stephen Aryan","https://preview.redd.it/916sgldyrsnd1.jpg?width=313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48b9932b1df9ec98b911a3d39a191d7129b4359

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/new-york-minute-by-stephen-aryan)

*New York Minute* is a noir thriller novella written by Stephen Aryan, set in an alternative New York with fantastical elements. A dark and bloody atmosphere combined with a well-written detective story, following an ex-police turned into a PI working for the most dangerous person of this New York, navigating the complicated underworld of the city.

Cole Blackman is not easily surprised after years working as PI; but he didn't expect to be recruited by the most feared crime boss in New York, Karl Dolman. His daughter Selina has gone missing; and if Cole doesn't find her soon, a gang war will tear down the city as they will perceive Dolman's weakness. Together with his childhood friend Bracken Heart, Cole will have to navigate the sordid underworld of the city and find Selina before the blood reaches the river; a complex job, as many people will try to interfere.

Aryan chooses to use a first person perspective, using the own Cole as the narrative voice; a smart excuse to put many details in front of the readers' eyes. Cole is somebody that has seen almost everything this New York has to offer, a vast experience that will help to navigate the complexity of this case. He might seem a cynical person, but we can also appreciate how he cares for Bracken; and definitely, it's a total professional in his field.  
Bracken is also a great character, acting a bit as a counterweight to Cole, pointing things that he might have missed or that can have a meaning. He's experiencing a degenerative illness, and probably that's why he's trying to make a better world before he's definitely out.  
I found fascinating the contrast that is offered through Dolman's character, the duality between being a crime boss and a family man; and while the rest of the secondaries have not much exposure, you can feel the complexity behind those characters.

In the style of many noir stories, we have a fast-paced story, focusing on that slice of the world we are, alternating some investigative scenes with well-written action moments. As previously said, using Cole's as the narrative voice gives Aryan the opportunity to include really detailed descriptions, allowing us to picture this alternative New York, a city in the vast drop of an untamed world, where more small locations are scattered through; some fantasy elements are thrown in, and the technology is less advanced than in our era. Worldbuilding is not excessively detailed, giving us some brushes that will be developed in next instalments.

*New York Minute* is an excellent noir story, a delight for those that like crime/detective novellas but set in an alternative yet familiar world; Aryan has proven his ability to change his registry, writing something really different from his previous published fantasy/historical fiction. You will be definitely surprised!",fantasy
"“The City and the City” by China Mievelle explores a unique, imaginative idea wrapped in a murder mystery","In the initial pages of *The City and The City* , we get all the tropes we would expect of a standard detective novel. We have the unorthodox detective, his adoring aide, a reluctance to get into the case, growing curiosity about it, and so on. Having got this book recommended from this subReddit, I was wondering where the fantasy elements are.

As I progressed through the book, the intrigue about the setting drew me in more than the murder mystery itself. There are the titular two cities, but they are apparently in the same locations. I liked the way in which buildings and locations belonging at once to both cities are described frequently by twists on familiar words such as topalganger, grosstopical and so on.

The administration is very strict about dwellers in each city not interacting with or even acknowledging any person or even object from the other, and all citizens surprisingly follow these rules very diligently. A lot of time (possibly the only downside of this book is that it’s maybe too much time) is spent detailing what circumstances can arise that would cause an interaction between people of these two cities and how the administration handles them. 

This all seemed dystopian to me when i first started understanding the book’s world. But by the time I finished it, I wasn’t sure anymore. We have too many real world, and even contemporary examples of different peoples existing in a common territory, and as disturbing as ‘unseeing’ other people is, who is to say it’s not a better alternative to raging wars to claim land. 

As for the murder mystery, it was resolved by the end, and in a satisfying way too, but I wasn’t turning the pages in eager anticipation of discovering who-had-dunnit. The murder mystery is fine, but it’s the intriguing world in which it is set that makes this book a solid, worthwhile read.",fantasy
Is it just me or does Fantasy have a disproportionately high amount of excellent audiobook narrators when compared to other genres?,"I admit this might be listener bias, but whenever I just casually look up posts about ""best narrators?"", it seems like I'm always running into fantasy series.

Steven Pacey for First Law, Peter Kenny for Witcher, James Marsters for Dresden Files, Michael Page for Gentlemen Bastards, Rupert Degas for Kingkiller, Michael Kramer and Kate Reading for Wheel of Time AND Stormlight Archive... There are probably a bunch more, feel free to share them in the comments.

It seems like I never hear this for other things that are a lot more popular, something like Hunger Games or Twilight or Colleen Hoover's books. I wonder why that is?

I suspect a big reason might be that publishers know that a lot of these are going to be series, so might as well invest in people who'll put a lot into it to keep the listeners coming back. Cause if it's a bad audiobook of, like, *The Grapes of Wrath*, sure, I might be able to push through. If it's a bad audiobook of the first 700 page book in a 20 book series, ain't no way I'm investing in that.

Anyway, share your thoughts and recommendations, as you will.

EDIT: Thank you for the responses, and I'd like to clarify that I do listen to plenty of non-fantasy. I even thought to add a caveat to specify what I meant.

Obviously, there are a LOT of books with incredible narrations. Off the top of my head: Derek Jacobi's Frankenstein, Frank Muller's Moby Dick, Michael Jayston's readings of John le Carré books, Ron McLarty's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

I was thinking more specifically of the really modern publishing successes. Like I said: Twilight, Hunger Games, Colleen Hoover or even something like Fourth Wing. I was just wondering that they don't seem to get the same kind of treatment and effort with their narrators, which seems odd to me, as I would've thought you'd want the most popular books to get the 10/10 treatment.

Or, like you all said, it might just be bias. Regardless, good narrators abound.",fantasy
"Naomi Novik's ""A Deadly Education"" is good.","This book attracted me primarily because the author does not hide the lethality of her invented school. Moreover, this book was highly advertised in our country.

First, about the cover. In Russia, it differs from the one that was produced in America. Our cover shows the academy painted in golden tones on a black background, with the name itself in the middle.

About the world of book. The children of magicians, when they reach adolescence, go to the Sholomancha magic school, where they will also live all the courses, or rather survive, because there you can die from a damn breakfast. And mana is obtained by various methods, either through living beings or through physical exercises.

The author has written the world of the book well enough and I did not have any huge questions.

Now about the plot component. The main character is trying to survive at school.

This is the whole plot, because the whole book is about everyday life in the school of death and it's interesting to watch. What kind of troubles the heroine gets into, how she tries to survive in all this, and attempts to join the enclaves. The author told about this in a very interesting way. And also the tension from one situation is added to the finale, which will be a spoiler if I tell you.

But what you can scold the book for is the beginning. It's too harsh and the reader doesn't understand what's going on, and then the heroine talks about her life for a very long time, but when this part ends, it gets much better.

Now let's talk about the main characters.

Galadriel aka El is annoying at first, but over time you start to like this obnoxious kid, and you even get into her.

Orion turned out to be a typical kind guy who wants to save everyone (which, by the way, pisses El off, because then you need to clean up all the mess that can kill her). Thank you that there are no descriptions of his abs.

The text here is good. The author has work experience, because she has been writing books since 2006, which means there are no problems with descriptions here.

As a result, I think the book is good, but if you expect a twisted plot, then the book is not for you. It's more about everyday life at the academy.",fantasy
Good Magic System but lighter tone?,"What's a fantasy you'd recommend that has an interesting magic system? I'm basically looking for something like Sanderson, but hopefully an easier digest and lighter tone.

Also would prefer if it's on the cleaner side of things- no sexual content or excessive swears.",fantasy
"The Ministry Of Time, Kaliane Bradley. Review","A time travel romance, a speculative spy thriller, a workplace comedy:  *The Ministry of Time*, the exhilarating debut novel by Kaliane Bradley.

Don't worry, the romance is stuck on feelings for almost the entire book. No touching, no confessions of love. Purely in their heads. 

It's really a funny, SciFi book with a bit of Spy Thriller stuff in it.  Funny as in Fun, not Pratchett style funny.

It  was also interesting. The cast of Characters:

Commander Graham Gore (1847): Royal navy commander. THis one was based of a real person, albeit one not generally known much of as far as history goes.

The others are fictional. 

Captain Arthur Reginald-Smyth (1916): extracted from the Battle of the Somme, WWI

Margaret Kemble (1665):  extracted from Great Plague of London, a hideous experience she had there.  She's great fun!

Some curse words she came up with: Pizzle-headed doorknob. Heron-faced fool

Lieutenant Thomas Cardingham (1645): man extracted from Battle of Naseby. Not well liked. Not fun.

Anne Spencer (1793): extracted from French Revolution

Their ""bridges"" or people assigned to help them adapt, they were funny too. Some of them anyway.

But some of the retrieved people insights were good too, their presentation to show they are worthy of passing their final tests were highly amusing.

It became obvious early on there are some characters from the future sneakily hanging about and...but that would spoil it.

In all a worthy and fun tale, well worth a read. 

The only annoyance I had was how long it took our POV to realise the nefarious goings on. BUt it was a very minor annoyance. 

This review is far better than mine and gives a more detailed synopsis of the book.

[Spoiler] One gripe with Long Live Evil,"Hokay.

Picked up and ate Long Live Evil over the weekend, perfectly cromulent villainess otome etcetc.

One thing kind of bothered me in the end.

Key becomes the Emperor, even though Rae fully explained it to be the King, and repeatedly said so to everyone. That's a *big* stretch, but I can generally offer books one big stretch.

But one of the ""what a twist"" elements at the end was the Golden Cobra having been startled when Rae tells him, a fellow isekai'd book lover, that Octavius becomes the Emperor; clearly a surprise to him, even though they both knew roughly the same story.

So... Why did he never tell her who he thought the Emperor was? Even if he didn't know it was Key (maybe it was someone else entirely in his version), he never revisits the topic.

Could I Interest You in a Dragon Novella Series? An ARC Review of The Mountain Crown by Karin Lowachee," 

*This review is based on an eARC (Advance Reading Copy) provided by the author in exchange for an honest review and can also be found* [*on my blog*](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/10/03/fantasy-novella-review-the-mountain-crown-by-karin-lowachee/)*.* The Mountain Crown *will be released on October 8, 2024.*

Karin Lowachee had been hanging around the middle of the TBR for what seemed like forever before I finally pulled *Warchild* off the stack this year. [I loved that book](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1cxmhxs/military_scifi_with_a_character_study_inside_a/), so when I saw she had a new novella series starting this year, I jumped at the chance to get an early copy of *The Mountain Crown*. 

*The Mountain Crown* follows a member of a people who had lived in close communion with the land and the dragons inhabiting it, to include regularly gathering enormous king dragons from their mountain homes, allowing the smaller life to flourish. But all this had become much more difficult when an imperial army took control of the land and sent many of its people running for safe haven on another continent. The trouble is, the dragons haven’t moved, and so the lead must make a pilgrimage back to her ancestral home to gather a king. But while the occupying empire officially sanctions such action, they’re in the business of exploiting as many resources as they can, and they don’t want to waste an opportunity to get their hands on a king dragon. 

The plot that follows is largely a standard quest narrative, but with plenty of fallout from past hostilities intruding both into the current quest and the setup for what is planned as a trilogy of novellas. The lead finds herself with a pair of companions who’d fought in the war, with plenty of physical and psychological scars to prove it. And so the story is much less about finding a king dragon—something the locals had been doing consistently for generations—than it is about trying to keep that dragon out of the wrong hands, all the while trying to heal a companion who possesses tremendous power but whose psychological instability makes him a danger to everyone around. 

As I’ve said in past reviews, I don’t tend to be especially compelled by the shape of quest narratives, so I appreciated *The Mountain Crown* focusing just as much on the characters as it did on the major quest. That said, with the novella length and the most significant arc coming from a secondary character, the book doesn’t get the chance to really dig into a character study in the same kind of way that *Warchild* does. It delivers a solid arc, but not one that will stick in my head for years. 

I actually found myself more compelled by the background conflict, for all that exploitative empires conquering the indigenous groups who keep the land in balance aren’t exactly a new topic in SFF. The wrinkle in *The Mountain Crown* is the staunch pacifism of the people, who had mustered little resistance because fighting back would fly in the face of their entire way of life. But by the time of the book’s setting, it’s undeniable that the occupation is a corrupting force that sickens everything it touches, and not fighting back is akin to letting the land die. This poses a philosophical conundrum that isn’t resolved in the first book but leaves plenty of material to explore in the sequel. 

In general, *The Mountain Crown* does a good job balancing telling a complete story with leaving those hints of the full series arc to come, though I personally found the elements hinted for the future a bit more compelling than the smaller-scale focus of the first book on one group of characters and one dragon. Still, Lowachee writes well, and *The Mountain Crown* tells a complete story for fans of character-focused quest narratives.  

*Recommended if you like:* character-driven quest stories, anti-colonial stories.

Court intrigue and character building books,"Hi all! 

I am trying to get back into reading more again and can't seem to find a rhythm. I really love fantasy settings and world building but looking for something a bit more with intrigue and politics along with the adventure. (Think like Marco Polo netflix series in a fantasy world). 

My current read are the Robin Hobbs farseer trilogy which I absolutely love the world of, but struggling to finish the Royal Assassin (2nd book) just because I really can't stand Fitz' character Vs what I would normally enjoy. (A bit too mopey and foolish).

Does anyone have any recommendations? I've heard The Will of the Many might be a good start, but looking for anything else!

Dark series also welcome (though I tried prince of thorns and that was a little too just an edgy 14year old doing evil things for the sake of it)",fantasy
High fantasy with hard magic?,"My husband and I are working on world-building together just for fun, but we can't settle on low vs. high fantasy and soft vs. hard magic systems.

I told him that it would nearly impossible to create a high fantasy world with a hard magic system because it would just take *forever* to make all the rules and explain every little thing that's unlike our real world. So, I suggested that we either go high fantasy--soft magic or low fantasy--hard magic, but he isn't understanding my reasoning, and I can't think of another way to say it. So, I went to examples:

High fantasy--soft magic -&gt; Lord of the Rings

Low fantasy--hard magic -&gt; Avatar: The Last Airbender

Low fantasy--mid magic -&gt; Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Mid fantasy--soft magic -&gt; Game of Thrones

But I can't think of an example of a high fantasy world with a hard magic system, probably because it would be extremely hard to create, which is my point. Anyone know an example?

"I loved The Stormlight Archive, could you recommend me other books I will love?","Hey guys. I've read The Stormlight Archive as my first epic fantasy, and then I read pretty much all of Sanderson's books. I tried a few other books, and while I liked them, I haven't really loved them as much as I love Stormlight. I think the main reason for this is my love for Kaladin, he became probably my favorite fictional character (or one of the two). I love his righteousness, bravery, determination, unflinching manner while facing people more ""powerful"" than him, how he's just a force of nature, I love his relationship with his crew too. I mean obviously I love the other characters (I like multiple pov stories) and pretty much everything else about the books, like the worldbuilding and the plot itself, and the... hype moments?

"Let's talk about Neal Stephenson's Anathem - A short, but unhappy, review. ","Stephenson put so much effort into making this book brilliant, he forgot to make it enjoyable.

At times, I felt as though I was reading something akin in excitment to a washing machine's manufacturing guide and warranty.

There were scant few glimmers of interest interspersed between endless and unnecessarily maximalist descriptions of tedium. Furthermore, I did not care one iota for the characterless characters, and I began to dread the part of the day that I dedicate to reading due to this very book.

The plot was spurious, at best. Go to the place, do the thing, go home again. It very much did not need 1000 pages to do it. It pains me, to know that a tree has died for this book, when it could have become something halfway actually useful, like toilet paper, or scientology leaflets. 

Stephenson would tease a half interesting concept, then bludgeon you to death with it until it felt like an exercise in banal mediocrity. This book took approximately 16 hours from my life, and I want them back. 

The book's key idea is that whenever a decision is made, a universe branches off with variables of that decision. Well, I wish I lived in the universe where I chose not to embark on what I will, from now on, refer to this book as: 'Stephenson's folly.' 

If you enjoy feeling bored and annoyed, and visiting your elderly grandparents isn't an option, read this book.",fantasy

# [Blackfish City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068768-blackfish-city) by Sam J. Miller

&gt;After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical and social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city’s denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced. The “orcamancer,” as she’s known, very subtly brings together four people—each living on the periphery—to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Blackfish City is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection.

&gt;  
&gt;And what Maya is seeing is the cover-up of a massacre. As she probes into the covert political power plays of a radically strange near-future Russia, she comes upon secrets that have been hidden from the world… and memories that AI-controlled thought police have forced her to hide from herself. Because in a world where no thought or desire is safe, the price of survival is betrayal—of your lover, your ideals, and yourself.

Tress of the Emerald Sea - Review,"Another Brandon Sanderson and GraphicAudio win. I've been wanting to try out the secret projects for a while now. And Tress, is this really cute romance story about a normal girl on an small island, falling in love with someone far above her station. One thing I really loved about this story is the images that narrator paints of this beautiful world. The spores are such a nice concepts and makes for even more pretty scenery. So often, when the narrator stops to describe the landscape, it makes you feel like it's truly magical, alien and beautiful. 

Another thing I love is that the narrator, of the story, and the way GraphicAudio handled it it's just such a huge win in my books there's no I way I cannot mention it. Aside from this the characters are solid, memorable, unique voices, amazing dialogue and the Cosmere is in it's full view. It can work as your first introduction to the Cosmere and Sanderson (though the best introduction to that is Emperor's Soul hands down), but there's so many characters, races, concepts that just makes so much sense and gives this view of a bigger, grander world at hand.  Aaaaand, slight spoilers, we also getmeet our first dragon in the Cosmere. It was such a cool moment and long awaited for me. I love dragons

I would totally recommend diving into this one, is short, the story, while very basic, can be enjoyable. Though sometimes there's too much plot armor or just events happening in such contrived way that you ask, why even do it at all. I'll expand on it later on this review. But if you enjoy a short romance, with loveable characters, beautiful world and cool adventure, this is for you.

For now I'll go fully into spoilers. Beware.

Having the voice actor of Hoid from Stormlight to narrate this book is just such a perfect casting. I was so suprised about it too. I didn't knew Hoid was the narrator until it dawned on me 10-15% through the book. 

I also enjoyed the pacing of the story, the ways the dialogue just felt so natural, the characters. You can see Sanderson experience just shining through in these aspects. Another thing I enjoyed was seeing Tress parents just helping her, the bit about how her father was owed so many favors, everyone in town would just scramble to help, event something dangerous. The way, that, even though she's a heroine, there's no tragic story behind it, and before even taking a huge dangerous step, she asked for their help. I felt like it was a nice change of pace, whereas, younger MCs parents in most books are non-existent.

The magic system, with the spores is also quite unique and interesting. Though it wasn't as expanded as most Cosmere systems.

But there are problems, mainly, plot problems!

First, Tress seems to be the perfect girl, she can do everything, that people on the ship cannot, or afraid to do. Then we spend so much time on how they're afraid of doing said chores, like being a sprouter, or sailing the dangerous seas, but in the end, it happens without many consequences. Especially for Tress. Everyone loves her, she's selfless to a fault, her mistakes aren't really mistakes or have zero consequences. She gets to face a dragon ffs, and comes out of it unscathed, after an entire arc about being sold as a slave to that dragon. She's near perfect, she's Tress.

Then you have the crew, all unique faces and voices. People from all over Cosmere too, and none can do what Tress does. Of course there's reasons behind it, but they feel shallow, just to boost the character. Writing more books in secret is very nice, but the plot and your character work can suffer out of it.

Then there's the Captain, a very cartoonish villain. You have reasons, she's dying because of the spores, she needs to travel to the dragon to get cured, ruthless, powerful. Like you have the ingredients for a really good villain here, but instead, this cartoonishly evil person. I just felt offput by this villain the entire book and I'm having a hard time saying why.

The interaction with the dragon was also kind of a letdown, aside from OMG seeing a dragon in the Cosmere. The stakes are being risen, the Captain does some really evil and humiliating to the crew to keep them in line so she can sell off Tress. Things are getting really bad and hopeless. Then they meet with dragon and negotiations start. My grip with this entire scene is that is just feels so badly written. Like you want this interaction, you want the high stakes, but you also want to have your heroine out of it. There's still another villain. So we spend quite a long time, like 70 to 80% of the book to get to the dragon, and the way the negotiations are down is just so bad. 

It's a good ending for the Captain mind you, it feels very gratifying. Especially with the things she's done beforehand. So like, the interaction itself isn't bad, or badly setup, but the negotiation is badly written. At some point I felt like the author is forcing this end to the negotiation to get on the story, and didn't feel something that naturally comes up as part of the story.

After this we go the the Sorceress, and Tress in her selfless way, decides to go alone with Huck (which I had theory of who he was around the time we meet him). Then the confrontation between Tress and Sorceress, what all this story been building up to, felt like a cheap trick. Here's your totally-not-fake bf, on your way you go! 

The Sorceress, this persona who cursed even Hoid and everyone fears her, from an entire kingdom to a dragon! She thinks that the girl she's been watching for a long time now, will fall for this trick and is even surprised! And the way it just ended up, Hoid fixing everything, even having the Sorceress leave planet! Oh and the crew coming to her help, sailing on dangerous waters, that we've been told about it multiple times....and with no consequences whatsoever. 

Then we get our happy ending, everyone on the ship gets pardoned, now the humans can sail the dangerous seas, Tress becomes a captain and is allowed to be with the Duke's son. It's a very standard happy ending to a cute adventure. 

Throughout, there's a pattern of building up stakes, events and characters, then not really being able to deliver on it. Maybe the story should have been longer or having things cut out of it. But it does happen in 90% of the delivers. The story structure is there, the characters are solid and amazing, the payoff is there too. But plot just lacks the necessary development to make that payoff that the author planned feel natural and good. And that's a shame.

In conclusion this was a good popcorn book as I like to call them. Read or listen in my case, and enjoy the story for what it is. I honestly hope to see more of the characters introduced here, even Tress later on the Cosmere. This book did a good job to expand on the Cosmere and make it feel even bigger than I imagined it to be!

Cheers!",fantasy

Big List: r/Fantasy's Top Self-Published Novels Voting Thread,"*Processing img lu86j0v0rrsd1...*

**It's time for another**  **Big List!** This time we are doing our favorite self-published novels. All speculative fiction qualifies (fantasy, science fiction, horror, magical realism, and more).

The results from last year's poll can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17enqms/big_list_rfantasys_top_selfpublished_novels_poll/)**.**

**Tl:dr:** post your ten favorite self-published novels/series. Top-level comments are for the votes only, with discussion happening in the replies.

# The rules are simple:

1. Make a list of **up to TEN** of your favorite self-published novels in a new comment in this thread. Don't overthink it, it's not about finding books that are objectively the best, just your favorite ones. You can change votes / your list as often as you like during the voting week. I'll start counting votes after the voting closes (October 21).
2. **Only books that are currently self-published count for this poll.** Self-published books picked by publishers are no longer eligible. We will also be ignoring hybrid series, like those by Michael J. Sullivan, T. Kingfisher, and Lois McMaster Bujold, where they're partially self-published and partially traditionally published. This concerns also Dungeon Crawler Carl since Ace picked print-only rights for it.
3. Only one vote per series: you can vote on multiple books by your favorite author, **BUT** **everything from the same series will be counted as one vote for that series.**
4. **Format your vote correctly -** The votes will be tallied with a script, so proper formatting is especially important to ensure it all goes smoothly. **Incorrectly formatted votes** **will not count**. I am going to be lenient with warnings and will help you fix it, but ultimately your vote is your responsibility.

# To format correctly:

* **Put each vote on a new line.** To do so, keep a blank line between every vote OR put two spaces before pressing enter. Making it a bullet-point list is fine.
* **Format your vote as Title - Author.** If unsure, please look at how most do it. Italics or bold should be perfectly fine. Common mistakes are putting the author first, listing just the book name, and omitting the ""-"" or separator...please do not do that, or your vote will not be counted.
* **Please leave all comments and discussions for the discussion posts under each original post.** In your voting comment, just list your top ten. This thread has the potential to be huge, and it'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. However, you can reply to voting comments with all the arguments and discussion you want!

# Voting info

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that book. **Upvotes and downvotes will not affect the final result.**

The voting will run for approximately one week and voting will close on October 12.

**Vote, discuss, and find new things to read.**

[Review] The Stranger of UI Darak by S.C. Eston (SPFBO 10),"**I read this for SPFBO. Continuing on with the semi-finalist choices of my teammates, my review only. More about the contest and links at the bottom.**

 

I really liked the cover of this book. It’s peaceful and threatening all at once.

So, this is going to be a weird review and hopefully not too repetitive (my brain is still on holiday mode so we will see how this reads in a couple days).

It’s hard to talk about a book like **The Stranger of Ul Darak.** It’s definitely a journey kind of story in the way that it falls together like it’s a thousand-piece puzzle.

You know how a lot of times when you have pov’s in different areas, you are kind of waiting to see how they relate to each other or to the world? Sometimes it’s obvious right away but in **The Stranger of Ul Darak** it takes a while to get to the understanding of how it all fits. Even having read the summary (which tells you everything and nothing at the same time) I struggled to place this world in my head. I don’t mean map-wise either which I totally skipped btw. but as a whole.

Usually, I have no patience for confusing worlds that seem like bits and bobs of this and that tossed together to finally make sense, but **The Stranger of Ul Darak** had just enough of that combo of interesting and keeping me wondering what was happening to make me want to keep going.

\*

The story follows a few people in that rolling pov style but for the most part we’re seeing it through the two younger characters Arth and Sheana and their mentors.

So, the writing in **Stranger** is thicker than I’d normally like, but it definitely sets an atmosphere for the story- fantastical maybe or just haunting- the whole thing felt very ‘fantasy’ from page one.  
Some characters can fly like genies without magic carpets, or had animal familiars they can communicate with or transfer their consciousness into but I think the biggest thing that gave it that feel was just the firm belief the people had of their place and way of life in their world.

Arth, in particular acts like the Eternal (the mountain range) has feelings and can be disappointed in his choices. Like the world itself is invested in the connection of its people to it, and their surroundings and would punish him/them if he/they didn’t follow the rules.

There were so many weird things that just belong without explanation or reason. I didn’t say to myself, “well, that’s not going to work!” during the story and I think because of the characters unfaltering belief that the mountains are angry and watching them (among other things) that led me to feel that ok it is possible, and yes, maybe there is a greater consciousness at play and this planet/world is as fantastical as it suggests.

That certainty in the world’s anger and sadness towards them for whatever slight they felt they had done it (like going to the base of the mountains or bringing a stranger home) added to that fantastical feeling because no one questioned it. It was just a strong unwavering belief in being punished. I myself, questioned constantly (what can I say, I’m a Capricorn) if the mountains were really that unhappy, I looked for clues through the story half expecting a man behind the curtain/ Wizard of Oz kind of reveal.

I enjoyed that state of unsettledness that the story left me in, while also being totally frustrated by it. I felt the story kind of wandered - maybe not too far off-track but enough that a little tightening could have enhanced it because it did take it’s time to get where it was going with its answers and my patience and interest were very close to the point of lagging.

 

All in all, outside of the wandering feel, my only other real issue was that I had a bit (and by bit, I mean a large bit) of a hang-up over the ages of Arth and Daltar. Nine and six, just seemed too young for the stuff they did or thought and talked about.

For the most part though I just tried to ignore the ages where I could and think of them of them as how they felt and was there for the journey.

I enjoyed this story and thought it was quite a neat world especially towards the end when things began to fall into place.

Does anyone have recommendations for fantasy books, series or comics that are very sincere in their nature? Something that believes 100% in what it is, something that's utterly genuine about being a fantasy.",fantasy
Which systems of magic have you found particularly gratifying/memorable?,"I feel like many of us here will have read so widely in fantasy that sometimes the motif of magic becomes unexceptional.

Books that have (for me) particularly captivating systems of magic inevitably end up being my favourites.

Some examples that I particularly enjoyed are from the Powder Mage books (B. McClellan), the Mistborn trilogy (B. Sanderson) and The Old Kingdom series (G. Nix).

These examples are all quite confrontation/battle-geared. 

Another one (of a different style) I love is from The Earthsea books (U. Le Guin) as this magic is much more organic/terrene - concerned with harnessing the weather/the natural world etc.

Would love to hear some of your particular favourites. (: ",fantasy
"Books without any ""life altering"" Romance ","This is my first post here and btw I did go through old posts before asking this question, 

But basically all I want is a fantasy book where Romance, most specifically, straight romance(sorry I'm sick of seeing girl and boy making cute faces in every single book) isn't a plot point. 

Like yk oh ""his love for her saved her"" Or ""oh, she was stupidily in love with him and couldn't save this main plot"" Man I hate when love(call it sex cause most of the time it's bloody love/lust at first sight) plays such a big role in decision making. 

So, sorry for the rant, but please  suggest me fantasy books with simple romance, if any, already established romances are alright. Like Ned stark And Catelyn were in asoiaf. Basically, a book without 20 smth year old people going on and on about their lover. ",fantasy
Does anyone want to talk with me about Fafhrd and the gray mouser? ,Hello! When I was reading the books all over again (haven’t read them in 1 year or something haha.)

First time fantasy reader,"I am a horror thriller reader through and through.
I’d like to start dabbling in some fantasy.
No smut.
Don’t really like romance.
I want creepy,spells,monsters,magic etc.
What is a good book to start with, I don’t want a long series or anything very difficult to read for first.

I did love the book project Hail Mary not sure if that’s more sci-fi or fantasy. I also ordered the spell shop (haven’t started it yet though.

TIA

Authors who disappeared. ,"What happened to them? Where did they go? Did they get dropped by publishers? Did they quit because they weren't making enough money? Suffering from mental illness? 

This isn't a bashing thread. It's a genuine curiosity thread. 

Authors I know who haven't published things due to mental illness. Scott Lynch. Saladin Ahmed (I think) 

Authors who vanished due to personal reasons. JV Jones. 

I'm interested in the authors who vanished without a trace. 

For example. Someone like Alan Campbell, author of Scar Night, Iron Angel, God of Clocks and the Gravedigger chronicles.  What happened to him. Where did he go? 

Anyone have any thoughts on what happened? Or are just curious as to what happened to their favourite Author. ",fantasy
Easy read Epic Fantasy,"I'm looking for some recommendations for books. I want to be invested in different characters and worlds, but I just don't really enioy the super descriptive writing style of authors like Tolkien or Jordan. 

Can you recommend some series with these specifications:

-Not that long of a series (It can be a standalone book, but if its a series then from 2-5 books)

-Good characters (relatable and with interesting dialogues. I really liked the characters/dialogue of the Gentlemen Bastards series, if that helps)

-Good writing, just not over descriptive

-Preferably epic fantasy, but if there are some recommendations that are not EF but check these requierements, feel free to comment them.",fantasy

I am desperate to get into Malazan but it’s my third time trying to read gardens of the moon and I just can’t ,"I have been trying to get into this series for a decade at least. Most recently I decided maybe if I can listen to it to get through the first book that might help me, but I even end up closing audible out of disinterest.

Which book should I bring to read while on my honeymoon. Tress of the Emerald Sea or Mistborn the Final Empire?,"I am getting married this weekend and decided I want to get back into reading. I haven’t read in a while due to my busy schedule and have seen so many recommendations of Brandon Sanderson. And after replaying baldur's gate 3 I wanted to read a fantasy book so naturally I impulsively bought both Tress of the Emerald Sea and Mistborn the Final Empire

I know each book can be read on its own and I plan to read both and might bring both to read.

Should I start with Mistborn like most people recommend? Or should I read Tress and enjoy a more comfy feel good story? (at least from what I’ve heard about the book) 

We will be busy most of the time so this will mainly be when we are having a lazy day or on the plane. ",fantasy
"Rec pls: MMC like Hrathen from Elantris (dark paladin or other Lawful Evil MMC with Even Evil Has Standards, Worthy Opponent and Detrminator tropes)","So I just finished Elantris by Brandon Sanderson amd loooved Hrathen's character and his dynamic with Sarene, except I wish there was more and that they had a romance arc.

I'm looking for books that feature a very self-disciplined, determined, intelligent and badass MMC who is devoted to a higher force such as a deity or some other lofty goal beyond him, yet is not an impassioned flighty zealot ready to jump into hate or prejudices. He must be high in the organization's hierarchy (if there is one), be capable in combat and willing to make sacrifices such as killing sb, but is not bloodthirsty and only treats it as a means to an end that is best avoided if there are other ways. He should be reasonable while still acting within his own set of values. He should be stoic, loyal, able to admit defeat or praise an opponent's worthiness/impressive move, determined, devoted to his duties and have a large scale mission (like converting a kindom or sth), be serious and confident. 

And I want the FMC to slowly unravel him and get through his defences and stoicism to become a temptation he cannot resist, despite his years of discipline and devotion to his service. And I would like her to be his rival in some way, where they match their wits and impress each other, always planning the next move.
Thank you!",fantasy
Daughter of the Moon Goddess review ,"I just finished the Daughter of the Moon Goddess duology and really quite enjoyed it. As DotMG was author Sue Lynn Tan’s first book I was definitely hesitant but was intrigued by the Chinese myth component so I thought I’d give it a go. IMO compared to some of the really popular female fantasy authors of right now, Tan has an excellent and very smart writing style. I am of East Asian descent so the story and mythology are components I really enjoyed and reminded me a lot of childhood stories my grandma would tell us. I feel like fantasy as a genre typically leans Eurocentric in its roots simply due to the giants that have literally written the best of fantasy like Tolkien. However, reading about eastern mythology and how it inspired this author really was exciting for me. Without giving any spoilers, DotMG is about Xingyin, a young girl who’s discovering her magic and family history and her journey of becoming an accomplished warrior and epic hero of her story. There is magic, mythology, action, family, love interests, villains, everything you want from a good fantasy. If you grew up with a love of eastern mythology I would definitely give this 2 part series a read. Not challenging and very easy to get into. ",fantasy
When do you think (western) publishers will start to pick up on the Progression Fantasy Subgenre?,"Progression Fantasy is a subgenre which involves characters gaining strength and abilities as the series goes on, putting their training and growth center-stage. You might also know it as Lit-RPG or Xianxia, both of which are sort of sub-sub-genres. These stories have, in recent years especially, gained major popularity online. Yet their prescence in western bookstores is still very low. Even Cradle, arguably the most popular English series in the subgenre, is self-published by the author. 

Most western PF series end up being serialized on websites like RoyalRoad or self-published onto Kindle. Despite their popularity it is incredibly rare for any of them to make their way to a bookstore. Some argue that their accesibility on the internet is an important draw of the genre.

  
Do you think that publishers will grab onto the genre pretty soon? Or will they not see any value in it, given that the current readerbase is so focused on (often free) web access?

Where do I start with fantasy books?,I know this question probably gets asked a lot but I can't find any good recommendations online. I want to get into fantasy but I feel like a lot of the books I find aren't really my cup of tea.

Any suggestions?,fantasy
New books/series,"I’m currently going through a Stormlight archive reread in anticipation of Wind and Truth. I have read a bunch of different series in the past and am looking for something that is as good as Stormlight or Mistborn. Brandon’s writing is just about perfect for me but I’m not finding a lot that compares. Some of the ones I’ve read were based on recommendations and I don’t think I would have read them otherwise.

For context I have read the following and will rate them accordingly:

Mistborn era 1: 8
Mistborn era 2: 9.5
Stormlight Archive: dare I say 10??
Red Rising: 8.5
Powder maige: 8
Eragon: 9
The Riyria Chronicles: 8
Age of Empire: 8.5
Cradle series: 6
Throne of glass: 5
First law trilogy: 7.5
Gentleman Bastard: 6.5 

I have tried to get into shadow of the gods by John Gwynne and the Gardens of the moon by Steven Erikson but kinda struggled getting into them. 

Any other recommendations?

New Locke Lamora story by Scott Lynch in Grimdark Magazine,"There's a new Locke Lamora story by Scott Lynch, *Locke Lamora and the Bottled Serpent,* (part 1 of 2) in Grimdark Magazine #40. 

&gt;In this tale from Locke's teenage years, our nervous, hormonal, romantically-confused hero spends a few months working as a bar-back in one of Camorr's most brutal Right People taverns. This is one of Father Chains' endless series of training and personal enrichment schemes; as per usual, it's full of fuckery, and as per usual, Locke is expected to work it all out himself. His only real ally of the moment is the aging mercenary Mazoc Szaba, a man addicted to risking his own life in a gambling spectacle involving poisoned wine.

&gt;As Locke's troubles boil over, so do Mazoc Szaba's debts, and when you publicly flaunt your obligations to the one and only Capa Barsavi, Barsavi reaches out to publicly remind you of them...

Five Horror Reads For October and Always (With Bingo Squares),"Hi, Reddit, it's been a while!

I've been on a horror kick this year, particularly possession horror for research purposes, but r/fantasy remains my home turf, so you lot get to see it instead of r/horror. 

The books I've read this year may look deceivingly light on the Bingo front, but I'm giving the Survival square special attention, because they're all heavy-hitting candidates in my opinion, which I'll argue for in each section.The horror genre really is made to work for this square on multiple levels, and they've been some of the best books I've read this year.

**The Exorcist** by William Peter Blatty: 

""...the world - the entire world - is having a massive nervous breakdown.""

I could expand this to a post all on its own, but I'm not sure it would do well here as opposed to r/horror. I'm not the first to observe that *The Exorcist* is like *The Lord of the Rings* of possession horror. I would posit that a discussion on the topic that doesn't include *The Exorcist* is doomed to be incomplete. It has its share of diehard fans who are still chasing the high, and brave dissenters who found it long-winded, boring, and dated. Horror fans who haven't read it are still at least aware of its existence. Because of its profound influence on the storytelling vocabulary of the genre, they still know the main story beats through cultural osmosis. As a recovering Catholic who loves to get deep in the theological weeds, count me as one of the diehards. The iconic scenes are definitely that, but the culture didn't prepare me for how very substantial this slow burning psychological nightmare was. It takes its time to set the table because it's the proper way to equip yourself for the banquet it serves. Blatty exhaustively rules out every other possible explanation for the possession because that's the only responsible thing to do in reality. Father Karris's struggle with faith is agonizing because God hardly feels real, and while the devil does, surely it couldn't be as real as this. You *will* use the oyster fork. I highly recommend the audiobook read by the author. The dialogue really comes alive, and Blatty's demon voice is bone-chilling.

Bingo Squares: 

Prologues and Epilogues (Hard Mode) 

Survival (Hard Mode) - When I think about what's fighting to stay alive in this book, or experiencing a violent rebirth brought on by necessity, I'm thinking about faith in the age of science, on a global and more personal level. I'm thinking about a divorced single mother's desperation to save not just her adolescent daughter's life, but also her innocence. Although this book may take a paternalistic approach to surviving these horrors, I think the ultimate message of unending and sacrificial love overpowers any critique of the story as a simplistic conservative Christian fantasy.  


**My Best Friend's Exorcism** by Grady Hendrix: The cover art is a masterpiece of the medium, immediately drawing your eye then delighting it with the details. It's a perfect candidate for the Judge A Book By Its Cover Square, so spoiler tagging the rest for Hard Mode chasers&gt;!.The story itself delivers on all the promises made by the cover: 80s nostalgia, a little corny and ridiculous, genre-savvy but totally sincere in its treatment of the power of friendship. The ending made me teary-eyed and aching at the depth of what a best friend means when you're sixteen and struggling. I think this is a great entry point for people who want to try horror and are up for a gross-out but want some well-placed humor and a satisfying ending to keep things from getting too disturbing.!&lt;

Bingo Squares:

Judge A Book By Its Cover

Survival (Hard Mode) - &gt;!High school is hell, or at least purgatory, and for many, friendship was the lifeline that got us through it. So what happens when something starts sawing away at that lifeline? There's an intensity to school-age friendships that is not only hard to replicate in the adult world, but also difficult to maintain. Your best friend withdrawing from you can have a life-or-death urgency to it. Teenage vulnerability being what it is, sometimes it's a matter of perception, and sometimes that threat is grounded in horrible truth. Saving your best friend is saving yourself.!&lt;

**Come Closer** by Sara Gran: This one is much leaner than the two books above, and meaner too. Written from the perspective of the possessed, *Come Closer* views the subject matter through a modern lens while still meditating on eternal questions. What is your demon? How did it get in? What is feeding it, and what does it mean to resist or succumb to it? What would it take to be saved, and can you save yourself? Part of what makes this story so fresh is that it changes the target from the classic ingenue to someone older, more established and worldly. But by no means is Amanda genre-savvy, and her bafflement over what's happening to her is both annoying and an authentic portrayal of someone who never learned her self well enough to protect it. I didn't feel good after reading this one, but it ground the dirt of human frailty into my mind's eye in a way I'll never scrub out, and overall, I think that's a good thing.

Bingo Squares:

Alliterative Title

Dreams

Survival (Hard Mode) - Like many existential horror stories, making it through the plot with your physical self intact is only part of the challenge. Even if you live, some essential part of you can still die, whether its by another's hands or your own. While the back cover copy and several reviews mention a successful job and happy marriage upended by the plot, I personally got the sense that Amanda's life and identity had been gradually eroding without her notice for a long time before the entity showed up. It had to wriggle its way in somehow, and no one makes it to their 30s without a crack or two in their psyche just waiting to be exploited. An insidious part of the horror is realizing how tricky it can be to separate flawed human nature from malicious outside influence, and that saying to yourself over and over, ""No, that wasn't me!"" isn't the shield you hope it will be.

**The Erstwhile Tyler Kyle** by Steve Hugh Westenra: And now for something completely different! There is nothing else in the world like this indie horror comedy. Pitched to fans of *Ghost Files*, *Buzzfeed Unsolved*, and *Twin Peaks*, **The Erstwhile Tyler Kyle** resembles these things but does not copy them. I could tell you it's about a guy solving the mystery of his dead mother in an isolated town full of weirdos, but that doesn't touch on the wholly unique form of WTFery on every page. It's disgusting and hilarious, with a caustic yet endearing dirtbag of a protagonist. I wanted to slap Tyler, but also wrap him in a blanket and feed him soup.

Set in a Small Town (Hard Mode)

Survival (Hard Mode) - Probably the easiest book to advocate for this square, Tyler does everything possible to survive this plot and his own self-destructive tendencies: running, hiding, fighting, leaving unhinged voicemails, making unwise choices in sexual partners, belting out psychadelic-fueled karaoke. But like **My Best Friend's Exorcism**, the threatened survival of the relationship between Tyler and Josh is what kept me turning pages. 

**The September House** by Carissa Orlando: 

""Needs must when the Devil drives.""

I only got 10 pages into this haunted house story before I started gushing about it to everyone in sight. Margaret finally has her dream house, a beautiful Victorian sold to her at a bargain price, and after spending all that time and money on restoration efforts, no way is she letting a bunch of ghosts ruin it. This woman is an icon and a legend, determined to outlast and outmaneuver their shenanigans. I started out like, ""She's just like me, for real for real!"" As the story went on, that morphed into, ""Oh no, she's just like my parents, and I get it honest."" This is another great read for both established horror readers and people looking to sample the genre for the first time.

Bingo Squares:

Survival (Hard Mode) - When I consider the psychological state of living in survival mode, this book perfectly captures that mindset. You develop a warped sense of what normal is. It is simultaneously not a big deal but extremely important that no one else know about it. You self-isolate, taking pride in your ability to roll with the punches without stopping to ask why you're getting hit at all. Your maladaptive coping mechanisms may keep you chugging along on the surface, but it's not sustainable. For some of us, it's the great character arc of our life to learn that what served you in the past is hurting you now. The scariest, most important thing you can do is cast it out and aim for better than fine.",fantasy

Review: The Wandering Inn Vol.1-2,"**The Wandering Inn – Review of Vol. 1 &amp; Vol. 2**

It is daunting trying to talk about The Wandering Inn.  It immediately invites a fixation on its size which currently eclipses every large epic fantasy series - for better and worse - that has gone through a traditional publisher.  It invites all the negative assumptions about the isekai and LitRPG genre of novels that have spilled into the indie publishing market.  Its quality and consistency ebs and flows at times like the tide.  It’s ambition feels like a python trying to swallow a horse whole.  It’s not exactly bad, but two volumes and roughly twenty-seven hundred pages later I still have no idea at all how to exactly judge it’s quality.

I find it amusing that I find enjoyment from reading it (some skimming of certain PoVs aside). There is certain satisfaction found in delving into it’s broad creeping scope of cast and world.  And yet I would struggle mightily to recommend it to anyone with any amount of confidence.  Because it’s flaws are significant and obvious to anyone who picks it up.  It flaunts them openly and without shame.  Because to fix them would require time and care that would impede on the timely releases, the size, the scope, and the meandering pacing.  You simply can’t write what this series has decided to be while having an editor and publisher draped over your shoulders running quality control.

*The Wandering Inn* (TWI henceforth) covers just about every staple fantasy genre trapping possible short of farm boys becoming heroes and that is only true if you take that trope in a most literal sense.  It swings from cozy slice of life, to dungeon crawling, to large armies in field combat, to modern social musings, morals, and ethical anachronisms applied to an older world setting not all that compatible.

And mind you, the author is well aware of the massive convergence of fantasy ideas and genres that they have slammed into each other.  By the end of Vol 2 Pirateaba seems resigned to the reality of the giant undertaking they’ve walked into.  They have an audience, they have a steady income source, and they love to write.  “Challenge accepted” is the prevailing wisdom with an underlying sense of “what’s the worst that can happen?” backstopping their sanity.

And so here I am, two volumes in to a currently 10 volume web serial (though they appear to have split the work into 14 volumes for the Amazon ebooks?) and I’ll try parse this out into something hopefully coherent for those who at all interested still, despite the series having been brought up constantly of late.


**PLOT &amp; STRUCTURE**

The starting point of the plot is modern day human teenagers and young adults are pulled into another world of medieval technology, magic, job classes, dragons, different fantasy races, etc. etc.  Isekai in its expected video game form and it plays this straight at least so far.  

We follow a 3rd person limited multiple point of view structure with new view point characters added over time though I have no idea how much and how far it will expand.  The first volume essentially has two viewpoints and the second volume adds several smaller ones interspersed around those still main two.

Long term plot goals are nebulous at best.  There are looming threats, physical and existential.  There is the obvious goal of “getting back home.”  But are any of these the main threats or goals?  There is simply no way to tell.  And given how much the author admits even in the first volume to having shifting plot goals, I suspect that even by volume two there’s likely only the vaguest of notions yet on what the target is.  So expect glacial speed of plot development.  If you want clear and tight goals and objectives, you’d best leave that hope at the door.

And as for plot structure, if it’s not already obvious that TWI is not traditional then this drives it home even more.  The volumes are really just one contiguous story.  It’s cutoffs between volumes are logical enough, but still essentially arbitrary.  Don’t expect traditional three act structures and sign posted foreshadowing.  You will get big events and they might even receive some hinting at, but they may feel more sudden then they should be.

I suspect the cause to that is simply a lack of editing and planning.  Given that there is almost no chance of going back and applying edits, a reliance on foreshadowing is bound to handcuff the author to ideas that they may not like by the time they actually get to them.  They would much rather be able to change their mind in the moment

Despite that, the good of TWI is that these major moments still feel good enough.  They draw in characters, escalate the stakes, and make the calm slice of life problems fade distantly into the background.  The convergences are meaningful.  Characters you like can and do die.  There will be significant consequences all around.


**CHARACTERS**

The story kicks off with Erin.  Erin Solstice.  (And that’s literally how she introduces herself to everyone she comes across.  “I’m Erin.  Erin Solstice.” like she were James Bond.  You’re either going to learn to get over these awkward character traits or it will drive you insane.)  

She will for (too?) long be the sole PoV character we have in volume 1.  A (mostly) normal American girl turning the corner to go into her bathroom suddenly finds herself teleported to another reality without warning.  Lost, tired, hungry, bedraggled after being accosted by monsters, she finds an abandoned inn a few miles outside of the town of Liscor.  And in the process of inhabiting it , she earns the class of [Innkeeper].  Erin is good-natured, moral and ethical to a fault, extroverted but very awkward, naive, and remarkably dumb.  I want to emphasize the “remarkably dumb” part.

You would be forgiven for thinking that the plot would then only be about a cozy fantasy story following a girl becoming an innkeeper (it is called The Wandering Inn, after-all) and you would be right for about the first third of the first volume which translates to roughly three hundred pages of Erin trying her best to accidentally die in a variety of stupid ways.

It’s somewhere around page three hundred when we suddenly switch to Ryoka Griffin where the author also takes the bold chance of moving from third person limited to first person limited as means of providing a change of pace.  

Turns out Ryoka was also dragged over from Earth.  She’s a tall east Asian cross country runner.  Stubborn.  Bad tempered.  Paranoid to a fault.  Hostile.  Remarkably intelligent (at least compared to Erin).  Knows martial arts and parkour.  She’s Erin’s opposite in just about every way though equally irritating.

While there are plenty of other characters and even some other brief foray’s into their perspectives, these two – Erin and Ryoka - are the primary vehicles in volume 1 and much still the case in volume 2.  Should you hate either of these characters (and that is not all that unlikely), you will be in for a rough, if not impossible, time.  Erin’s stupidity and Ryoka’s self-destructive stubbornness will deflect many readers from this series.  These elements improve given time, but the pacing of the story means that you, the reader, are in for thousands of pages of these behaviors.

And it should be said, other characters are equally defined by their extreme personality traits.  Relc is boisterous, brash, and inconsiderate.  Pisces is slovenly, uptight, and academic to the point of lacking basic social traits.  Klbkch is calm, reasonable, and logical.  And so on for any other character.  So do not expect things beyond standard archetypes.  They’re not likely to ever change.

But TWI would hardly be the first epic fantasy series to rely upon archetypes to quickly establish it’s cast.  As a concept it works well enough.  In practice I see them turning a lot of readers away.

**PACING**

TWI’s pacing is slow falling somewhere in between a glacier and a turtle.

Brevity, if you hadn’t concluded this already, is not the goal of TWI.  Brevity likely does not exist in Pirateaba’s dictionary.  They are perfectly fine with having a chapter that is focused on Erin running the inn, or playing chess, or making burgers in town, or having a party at the inn using a magically boosted iPhone to play modern music that attracts half the nearby city.  This is the nature of these books.  Slice of life, quiet moments, personal struggles, modern culture meets medieval overlaid with video game logic, until suddenly onerous large scale danger runs amok.

And while slice of life is set to drag things out enough on it’s own, there are yet other authorial issues that make it notably worse.  

Let me explain.

When one character arrives at a major event such as a fight, it is not uncommon to then rewind the clock to tag along through another character’s eyes and follow them step by step all the way up to the same event and then repeat as needed for all PoVs.  In this relentless drive for clarity of all involved parties, we instead end up with predictable setup habits and a tendency towards even more bloat.  I don’t know if this is the author’s way to aid in keeping track of where multiple characters are and thus avoiding introduction of continuity issues, but the end result is one that feels mechanical.

We simply don’t need to know the ins and outs of all of these characters.  Ambiguity helps to drive mystery and story while keeping the pacing and bloat under control.  You could whittle these volumes down considerably if some actual artistry was done from an editing perspective.  Well placed time skips to gently move things along.  Excising entire sections that are not important.  But you simply don’t get that with this series which is why I’ve found myself resorting to skimming.  There’s no point in reading a lot of things that just do not matter.  When you can skim pages and still know fully what is going on, you know there is a bit of a struggle occurring on the author’s end.

I will say that clearly some people really like this boat and I will add that the amount of dialogue, which leads to a lot of white space, means that the page count probably ends up more deceptive then you might think.  But all the same, if you’re a fan of a series that respects your time, this is not that kind of series in any shape or form.


**DIALOGUE**

Usually I would not highlight dialogue on it’s own.  But here it at least needs a mention.  

I will make two observations:

First, the dialogue in TWI is not particularly amazing.  It starts with Erin awkwardly talking to herself for the first eighty odd pages where she is being dumber than a rock.  But when she finally gets to talk to other sapient people, the dialogue is clunky and awkward.

Second, the dialogue does improve as the story moves along and Pirateaba hones their familiarity though with one particular caveat of note.

The book will at times introduce new characters as stories tend to do.  The problem is that new characters have a feeling out period where you can tell that the author is trying to form a fleshed out character in their head.  At which point, the dialogue clunk is going to increase until there is a comfort level with who a character is.  Wesle the guard from late in volume 2 is a good example of this.

On the other hand, sometimes the author does have a strong inspiration from the start with a character.  Octavia the alchemist or Thomas the Clown definitely came out fully formed.  So it’s a caveat with it’s own caveat.


**MISC.**

Here I’d simply like to end this with some random thoughts and observations that I wasn’t sure where else to put them:

Credit to the author for having a lot of difference races and some distinct cultural elements.  Language by all races (exception Goblins so far) is apparently all modern day English and spoken by everyone, so there’s that little issue.  But I appreciate the attempt nonetheless in having variety.

By that same token, it feels like anything goes with this world.  Six inch tall people exist and can be generals for armies of normal sized people.  Or you have cursed humans who are something aquatic but removed the cursing creature before it takes them over.  But this kind of thing is just there suddenly and inexplicably.  Which can be fun, but also feels almost random.  I worry for the logical outcomes to this world and I should probably stop looking for logic.

Speaking of logic, I was disappointed in one of the plot points that has Ryoka discovering something in all of five minutes that no one in the actual world at large has figured out in presumably thousands of years, or at least hundreds.  It’s so basic and tied to something so fundamental to the world at large that it’s honestly insulting to the native inhabitants and creates something not much different from a “white savior” style trope.  It also suggests that the author is likely to struggle with writing characters that are actually smart.  So I’m not expecting much.

Amusingly, the few chapters with Thomas the Clown in volume 2 might be my favorite part of the story so far.  It was only a few short (relative to everything else, at least) PoV sections before going back to the usual cast, but it managed to tell a compelling short narrative of another group of isekai’d kids who are stuck on another continent where there is endless war.  Some additional world building and potential cause for why everyone ended up pulled to this world aside, Thomas’s short tale is actually of good quality, inventive, and very dark.  Sure, it’s clearly a homage to another infamous clown but all the same it hits hard and it’s a shame that, by all indications, he will not be a huge PoV character in the series.  I much preferred that group to Erin, Ryoka, and those orbiting around them.

Speaking of Erin, she’s a bit too much most of the time.  I appreciate that she cares but her flaw is that she’s just too damn nice.  At worst she’s just too oblivious to be at fault.  And to be frank, I’ve never been a fan of that kind of character.  Other characters can be prejudiced, rude, violent, and unfair.  But not Erin.  Having a modern day white girl show the new world she inhabits that they’re just morally and ethically inferior just isn’t a good look no matter how you try to spin it.  It’s Hermione with the house elves, but so, so much worse.

**CONCLUSION**

*Do I recommend the series?*  I honestly don’t know.  

It’s an interesting amateur level writing experiment.  If you can look past it’s fundamental flaws, there is something to enjoy but best to keep expectations low starting out.  There's a lot of rank smoke to get through before there's fire.

*Do I like the books?*  I think so???  But I don’t know how long of a leash it has for me.  The story would need to do some tremendously interesting things and cut down on the flaws for me to carry this through to the end (or catch up to where the story is still being written, as is such)

*Would I keep reading if it wasn't free?*  No, no, probably not.  Which is a pretty damning admission, but as any gamer knows the freemium model can be pretty attractive when you want to do a lot of something but don't want to actually part with anything other than your time (And yes, I know libraries exist but interacting with people is scary.  Don't make me do that. /s)  Joking aside though, the Amazon released ebooks are only $3 each so it's not exactly expensive and there are free ways that are very accessible, but if it were priced like a more normal book at $7-15 then this would be an easy skip.",fantasy

A little hatred,"I’ve been hoarding the age of madness series for a while because I just don’t want to be finished with them, like saving the expensive wine for a rainy day. It only took me a week to blow through this book and I loved every second of it. After finishing it, a minute of just starring at the wall saying “fuck 🤯” happened.  This has made me want to start the next book immediately and at the same time hoard the last two books even harder. ",fantasy
What tropes do you think could cross genres/culture/media?,"In addition to liking fantasy I also love games/anime, and I always wonder about why some tropes don't seem to make the shift from culture and media. For instance, I see the ""mysterious transfer student"" deal used a great deal in Eastern works, but not so much Western media, even though magical school stories abound.

I guess a midpoint would be light novels, but then light novels seem to have their own share of tropes that don't leave that genre much either (haughty princesses/isekai) 

(Actually isekai has been a huge staple of the fantasy genre, but it's usually done in a very different fashion I guess...)

Do you think it's a matter of people just being used to what they are used to? We are seeing more cross-cultural work these days though.

Recs for fantasy adventure books where the MC is secondary to the main story,"What I mean is avoiding chosen one stories, pref a male MC with a nice progression into being maybe the kings right hand or an interesting pawn in the chess game of the larger story in the world.

Open to all kinds of fantasy subgenres

I thought of this because of the game kingdom come deliverance, where, although it is not fantasy, the MC is a nobody who is more or less a spectator or side actor to the major story of the world, but nonetheless progresses (he is revealed to be a bastard son of a lord but still far off of being the most important person in the country)",fantasy

**Spoiler Warning For The Black Company books one to three**


&gt;!While the style of The Black Company is really interesting, what utterly disapointed me is that three books in the story stops being about mercenaries and goes back to your run of the mill, merry band of heroes fighting against the forces of Darkness, unless this time everyone sort of behaves like a moody teenager. This isn't a statement about the quality of The Black Company books BTW which I'm sure are good even after Book three but honestly I'm not into the kind of story where it's headed!&lt;

Did anyone already read Warlords of the Wyrdwood? (2nd book after Gods of the Wyrdwood by R. J. Barker),"I feel like I was seeing *Gods of the Wyrdwood* all over this subreddit this past year being acclaimed. I read it this summer and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I just found out the second book has been out since September 10! I just ordered it on Amazon and tried to find some discussion about it, but it's pretty poor anywhere. No discussion whatsoever on it on Reddit, which I find surprising.

So, did anyone had time to read It since its release? Is it as good as the first? No spoilers please, don't even have it in my hands yet. I'll post my review when I finish it.",fantasy
Things you don't see in fantasy much.,"When you see a magic user in fantasy they are usually throwing fire, lightning or levitating things and I've gotten a bit bored of it.

Transform something other than themselves.

Heal people or things.

Summoning creatures to do stuff for them.

Predict the future.

What are you favourite cities in fantasy that are based on real historical cities?,"I’ve always liked the idea of cities, city states, and realms in fantasy being heavily based on real cities/a mishmash of cities. Like Braavos in SOIAF having elements of Venice and Rhodes. Which fantasy realms/cities based in reality are your favourites?",fantasy
My thoughts on fantasy naming may be controversial,"I think it's great when people base their fantasy names - whether names of people, locations, or other - on existing language systems. I think it's great when they use one language as a basis for one people group and a different language as a basis for another people group so each group has a distinctive feeling and the naming conventions may be similar within its own context. I think it's absolutely astounding of great authors like Tolkien who created their own language systems.

However, fantasy is fantasy, and it's not likely that the characters in a lot of the fantasy worlds we make up speak any real-world languages. Therefore, I don't think we always have to hold ourselves to strict and rigid language systems or existing naming conventions for the worlds and characters we design. Obviously if that's the approach someone wants to take, then that's awesome, but I feel like there's a place for just choosing names that fit our characters simply by the sound of the name. Even if you're giving a character their name because of the meaning it has in a real-world language, I think that can hold some of it significance while still being okay to use in fantasy. Having a real-world meaning for a name can be more for the reader's benefit, as a way for the writer to hint at some element of that character's personality or story, but even if the name's meaning doesn't technically translate into the fantasy world, it can still be fine to use. 

Idk, I just think since it's fantasy, we can use whatever names we want. If we want to have people groups with similar sounding names within that group, I think we should have the liberty to use names that have similar soundings, even if they're from different real-world languages. Again, there's a *lot* to be said for getting technical and researching language origins and so forth, but I think we as fantasy writers or worldbuilders should get to kinda just do what we want sometimes, too. Because, again, our languages likely do not exist in any of our fantasy worlds, so how would they know if all the Gnomish names are Russin inspired if there's no Russian and all the Elvish names are English inspired if there's no English?

Mothers in Fantasy,"Hi all,

I recently had a baby and would like to read some fantasy books that prominently feature a mother or motherhood, if any exist. I read a wide variety of fantasy books, the only ones I’m not really into are the romantasy subgenre. Anything else is fair game.

Edit as suggested:

I was looking for characters that are making their way along the motherhood journey so that I can travel with them. The book doesn’t have to be cozy, as in my limited experience as a first time mom, motherhood isn’t easy, plus it really changes you as a person. A mother character in my mind would be inherently different to a one that wasn’t. There is such an identity shift when you become a mom that I’m curious to see how authors portray that. Basically, is my brain working normally is the question lol.

I was inspired to make this post based on a book I read from a recommendation on a previous post today - The Scroll of Years: A Gaunt and Bone Novel. I’d never read a fantasy book with a pregnant main character before and it was delightful! So I thought hey, why not see if there are any books with mother characters. 

Excerpt: “Alas, sometimes a parent is very cruel to a child, because the child does not fit into the world the parent has made. Often a world built of very hard work indeed.”",fantasy
What is the book with the best romance you've ever read?,"On the contrary of a few posts here and... a lot of the comments in this sub, I love a good romance. I'd like you to recommend me good books with romantic plots. The romance can be only part of the plot or the actual plot itself, I'd just like you to make it clear which one of your recommendation is it so I can have a good perspective of the book.

  
Honestly, I neve read a romance only book I guess, so I'm totally opened to try it, especially being in a fantasy setting. 

  
I'd love to hear more about the plot as well if that's ok. Let me hear what other romantics out there have to recommend :)",fantasy
Finished my Bingo card for 2024,"*Obvious disclaimer: This post is my opinion, and everyone is free to think otherwise*

Finished my bingo card. Although I might make a few changes and improvement, the card is finished enough to share my thoughts and stats. 

Another year in which I've tried to use mainly book that I own or that were on my TBR list.

Also, a warning: I'll try to mark major spoilers, but I might not hide smaller ones.


First in series: One of the easiest squares to fill, and was shuffled around multiple times when I've transferred books I've read for it to other squares. At the end, I've landed on **The Last Dragonslayer** by Jasper Fforde, a book about a girl managing a magical agency. The first half of the book was exactly what I've wanted – the type of interaction between fantasy and the mundane that is one of my favorite things in the genre. The second half was nice.

Alliterative Title: Another easier to fill square that was filled naturally. **Dark Arts and a Daiquiri** by Annette Marie is a sequel in an urban fantasy series with an interesting story and insufferable main character. Dropped the series.

Under the Surface: One of the squares I might still change, since my current choice feels like a technicality. Still, **The Butcher's Masquerade** by Matt Dinniman is another delightfully insane book in the great LITRPG series.

Criminals:  For this square I've read **The Dragon Business** by Kevin J. Anderson,  a nice book about a king trying to make his son less naïve by telling him stories from his past as a wandering con man. The book somewhat suffer from the fact that there is not a single character that is not at least partially a bad guy.

Dreams: a square that gave me serious trouble, but at the end I've found multiple books that fit. Most of them are used for other squares, so in the end I've used **Tree of Aeons** by spaizzzer. A very niche LITRPG about a man reincarnated as a magical spirit tree in another world. The first book was surprisingly good, and I especially liked the long time span of the book.


Entitled Animals: After originally planning to use a book that very technically fits, I've ended up reading **Unicorn Precinct** by Keith R.A. DeCandido. The second book In A good police procedural series in a fantasy world.


Bards: I'm reading **The Return of Fitzroy Angursell** by Victoria Goddard mainly because I want to read the sequel to **The Hands of the Emperor**, which is one of my favorite books. But In the end I've enjoyed it immensely for its own merits, even if it's not as good.

Prologues and Epilogues: One of the books that I've knew I will read, the question was just which square. In the end **Oathbreakers Anonymous** by Scott Warren landed on this square. It's a solid humoristic book about a half-orc paladin that ends up as an oathbreaker without knowing why, and goes on a journey to regain his powers. Weirdly, the book doesn't really deal with the idea of faith too much.

Self-Published or Indie Publisher: Depending on the exact definition of ""indie published"", a significant portions of my bingo books could be used for this square. But at the end, I've used **Return of the Runebound Professor**by Actus, a story about a music teacher reincarnated in another world in the body of a magic teacher that is also a terrible person, and then cursed/blessed to return to life every time he dies. Nothing in the story makes sense, least of all the school (which is in fact not really a school), but the first volume was enjoyable. 

Romantasy: I've read **A Magic of Magic and Magic** by Ember East solely because of the name, because how can you ignore a parody book with that name? It's a very fun and over the top parody on the romance genre. Just as an example: the leads (a Sparklemancer and a Hexinator) &gt;!are faced with a doppelganger that tries to impersonate them and they find the real version through their true love. Very cliché. Except that the doppelganger enters from the other side of the room, changes in front of them, doesn't make any effort to mix physically with his target, and says stuff like ""let's run together, my abs are perfect"" while the main characters act like it's actually a challenge and they will pull through only thanks to their special connection!&lt;


Dark Academia: Each year, there is a square I don't really understand, and as a result I'm forced to read a book I'm *sure* qualifies instead of a book I want to read. In this case **Blood Over Bright Haven** by M.L. Wang that perfectly does the story it's going for. And since it's not a story I enjoy, I hated it.

Multi-POV: a few shuffles, but at the end I've used **Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell** by Susanna Clarke, an alternate history about two magicians in the time of the Napoleonic wars.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but didn't really like the first 300 pages and hated the last 300 pages. So the 200 pages in the middle weren't really worth it.


Published in 2024: Weirdly had a hard time with this square, since many of the books and authors I could have used are taken by different squares. Ended up using **Library System Reset: Overdue** by K.T. Hanna, a very niche idea with light LITRPG elements about a college students that get kidnaped by an interstellar dying magical library in order to fix it. Novel idea and good execution, but could have used better editing.

Character with a Disability: **The Fey Hotel** by Vermilion H Baine is a romantasy book that describes itself as ""lighthearted dark fantasy"". It is way less Cozy than it sounds from the blurb. The female MC suffers from hearing problems, and the author actually remember and uses it throughout the book. Overall I've enjoyed it, but not enough to read more from the author. 

Published in the 1990s: Ended up as one of my most shuffled sqaures. I'm really happy with **Dark Lord of Derkholm** by Diana Wynne Jones. A fantasy world is being blackmailed to allow tourists from our world, and act in a trope-y way for them. And they are starting to grow tired. It's kind of a sequel to **The Tough Guide to Fantasyland** which was great.

Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins - Oh My!: I've read **Grunts** by Mary Gentle. It's an insane humoristic book, and I feel like there is a grand conspiracy to describe it wrong. I've seen it described as ""grunts getting disgruntled with the BBG before the final battle"". That is not what the book is about. The book is about a bunch of Orcs getting possessed by a stash of US weaponry and turning into orc Marines. Be warned that the book is highly offensive, and make bad taste jokes about SA and murder throughout the book.

Space Opera: Originally I've planned to use some Star Wars old canon book, but ended up using **The Captain** by Will Wight. The first book in the new sci-fantasy series by Will about a guy that starts completely overpowered but face problems he still can't solve, at least not alone. Very much a setup book, but shows great potential.

Author of Color: I've read **All You Need Is Kill** by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. This is the book the movie Edge of Tomorrow is based on, and it's fascinating to see how different the stories are past a few basic details. I don't think one of them is worse, but they are very different stories that try to do different things.

Survival: **Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir is a brilliant sci-fi novel, with a fantastic ending. Can't really say anything about it without spoiling it.

Judge A Book By Its Cover: **Feathers of Gold** by Rowan Silver Is a disappointing urban fantasy about a dragon in LA, with a pretty cover. The escalation is crazy for a first book in a series. Also, one day I'll find a book with a council of wizards that isn't &gt;!Horribly corrupt or inept!&lt;

Set in a Small Town: In every detective novel, there is one suspected that keep making themselves more and more suspect because they try to hide something unrelated, or because they keep snooping where they don't belong. **Baking Bad** by Kim M. Watt Is a book written 1/3 from the POV of such suspects, 1/3 from the POV of the detective, and 1/3 from the POV of a dragon. My main problem is that the detective is my favorite character in the book, and it doesn't sound like she will be in the sequel. 

Five SFF Short Stories: I hate this square. In my 7 years of bingo, there was *one* anthology that I've enjoyed. This year, not only was **Don't Touch That!: A Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy Parenting Anthology** by Jaymee Goh bad, many of the authors apparently didn't get the memo with the description of the anthology, and instead  of stories about parenting wrote stories that had a parent or a child somewhere in them.

Eldritch Creatures: **The Apocalypse Codex** by Charles Stross is another great book in a series about a bureaucratic British agency tasked with the eldritch supernatural, although there were a few things I didn't like this time.

Reference Materials: In theory **The Menocht Loop** is an interesting twist on a ""Time loop"" story, but in practice It's not too good. I'm considering giving it another book before dropping it, but I'm not sure.

Book Club or Readalong Book: **Children of Time** by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a fascinating sci-fi book about spiders, but a combination of the ending which I didn't like as much, one specific scene that had actual negative impact on my mental health and the characters I was most interested in being no longer relevant means the sequel is a really low priority for me

"If you could adapt any literary world or series into a videogame, what would it be and what developer would you want to do it?","I think The First Law would be amazing if it were adapted into an RPG. I'd love to play as Logen, but I would probably go the same route CD Projekt Red went with The Witcher, writing new stories that are essentially 'sequels' to the books instead of directly adapting existing material, as this gives the studio more freedom.

CDPR would definitely be a good fit, as they usually nail the characters and dialogue, which is what Abercrombie excels at. I could also see a studio like Larian or Obsidian take it on, or even Rockstar.

Timeloop fantasy?,"Despite George R.R. Martin's A Song Of Ice And Fire being one of the most highly regarded fantasy series of all time, I personally found myself enjoying and being drawn more to two particular pieces of fanfiction more than I ever did the original books which I still love and adore with all my heart. They are 'Purple Days' by Baurus on the SpaceBattles forum and The Wheel Unbroken by TheAnimaniacDude on AO3. Both of them feature the protagonist (Joffrey in PD and Jon in TWU) being sent back to a specific point in time whenever they die and I absolutely love the concept of that so I am now looking for books that do the same thing where the protagonist goes back in time every time they die. I'm not looking for a Groundhog Day like story where the same day is stuck on repeat or like Happy Death Day where the goal is to survive the day (though if a book like that exists, feel free to tell me). Rather, I'm looking for books with one clear protagonist that lives for months or even years and goes back in time everytime he dies to unfuck all his mistakes. The time travel can become a really interesting plot device along with the mental toll it takes on the protagonist.",fantasy

"I have never DNF a series or a book, but I’m about to give up the Book of the new sun.","I usually choose the books and series I start quite carefully, because once I begin I usually binge the whole thing. But I started the Book of the new sun by Gene Wolfe because of an interview of George R.R Martin that I’ve read on this sub.

In an interview he did for Oxford university I believe, he was saying he would have like to do what Gene did with BotnS, because he wrote all the books in his series before publishing them. He could afford to do so because he had a job that paid his bills in the meantime.

Anyways, when I read that I thought to myself that if an author as the possibility to do that, then the book must have a very well crafted plot with a lot of intricacies and so on. So just bought the first book and started reading.

Shadow of the Torturer was alright. I like the world he is building and the character is interesting and there the plot of the book seem to take shape. I wasn’t overly excited by it but I finished and bought the 2nd book.

I am now almost done with the Claw of the Conciliator, and I reach the chapter “Dr Talos’s Play”… and oh lord…

At that point the plot is already, if not incomprehensible, just very fucking strange and I don’t find it engaging anymore.
This is my comprehension of what’s going on so far:
- Severian wants to go to Thrax for his guild’s sake
- But he’s in love with Dorcas who is somehow came back to life and doesn’t remember it
- He had a fascination for Vodalus and is now sworn to him even if he never meant to do his bidding 
- And we understand from the moments Severian breaks the 4th wall that he is now (as in the time he writes the books) Autarch or at least the new ruler of House Absolute (which is a fucking spaceship too apparently)

So, now it seems that the book is largely gonna be about how he became the ruler right? 

But I just read Dr Talos’s play and this chapter just took all the will I had to finish the series. I’m even about to give up on the book even tho I’m so close to the end.

I search online what people were saying about this chapter and apparently everyone agrees on one thing and that is that you are supposed to be confused. What the fuck is going on. Why would you write such a large chapter that makes no sense and seemingly doesn’t do anything for the story. And even if it does later, it’s so convoluted in metaphors and the like that I bet I still wouldn’t see the point.

Now I just do not feel excited about the plot. I am not wondering what’s going to happen, I don’t particularly feel empathy for any of the characters, except for Jonas who just fucking teleported out of there. Severian is seemingly a rapist on top of everything. I just don’t have anything compelling me to finish the books beside my own mania to always finish these things.

Have you guys been in the position? Does it get better? Or if I push on, am I just going to get most of the same?


PS: I read almost only exclusively fantasy and SF, I’ve read a LOT of grimdark stuff with characters darker and less likable that Severian so it’s not the problem for me.
Those books are also tiny in comparison to what I usually read, which makes it even harder for me to give up even tho I’m developing an unhealthy relationship with those books.

Trying to find this book!,"I red a 📖  many years ago. I cannot remember  the name of the author, but the book was basically about two classes of the same race. 

They start life as one race, but as they mature into their pubescent years they go one of two directions completely by natural selection and autonomous of their upbringing. One, becoming the protagonists who feed on the ""lower class"" like cattle. The ""lower class sect"" produces an overabundance of enzymes needed for life, while the protagonists gain strength, and a feeder tenticle system basically to feed from them, vampirism like, leaving them completely drained of life. 

The book is basically about a boy and a girl and their prepubescent love and what happens to it and them as puberty hits and they diverge the two directions.

"Review - 5/10 for ""Cradle"" series by Will Wight (completed)","Hi all, I've just finished reading the last book of the series (Waybound), and I wanted to share my two cents on Cradle!

**Rating: 5/10**

**In short:** Cradle offers a fast-paced, accessible entry into the progression fantasy genre but falls short in depth, character development, and world-building. It’s a decent read for newcomers but it's disappointing for seasoned fans of cultivation novels.

**Why this rating:**

(spoilers will be hidden)

* **Preface:** Mad respect to the author Will Wight for being a commercially very successful self-published author and for popularizing the (Asian) Progression Fantasy genre to a Western audience.
* The series was recommended to me by a friend, claiming it was his *favorite* cultivation novel. Now I understand it was his *first* cultivation novel, thus why it seemed so cool and new to him. I think a lot of Westerners/Americans claim Cradle is great for the same reason.
* To me, it felt like a watered-down version of all the Chinese-translated cultivation novels I've read. The typical tropes are here, but it lacked the depth of real Chinese, Korean, or Japanese fiction (be it light novel, manga, or webtoon). There were some attempts by the author at Daoist tropes like &gt;!Revelations during the progression through ranks!&lt;, but it felt poorly executed to me. I couldn't buy it, and &gt;!the revelations!&lt; themselves felt superficial.
* As you all know, there are thousands of copycats in the Wuxia, Xianxia, and Xuanhuan genres, and originality is scarce. Tropes and MCs are all the same. Once you've read a couple, it's like you've read them all. You become jaded and you start looking for a rare, original gem\* (I share a few gems at the end of the post). From what my friend told me, I thought Cradle would be this gem, but it's not; it's yet another progression fantasy book. It doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it just waters it down a bit.
* To be a great, 8-10/10 fiction, a story needs to bring something really new, or the author needs to be the best in the world at something. A few examples: Eiichiro Oda (One Piece) is probably the best at world-building and farsighted plot planning; Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan) is probably the best at foreshadowing and plot twists. One Piece touches on important themes like Slavery, History and Censorship, or Death and Grief; Attack on Titan touches on War, the cycle of hatred and violence. Will Wight achieves no particular feat as an author in his novels; no big themes are touched on (except maybe the curse of being weak with early Lindon). It's superficial, it lacks depth.
* What I think is thrilling and keeps the reader engaged in most fictions is Mysteries and the quest to unravel them (e.g., what is the One Piece, how to get to the top floor of Tower of God, where do the Titans come from in Attack on Titan, etc.). The Mysteries in Cradle were ruined by both the &gt;!very early appearance of Suriel!&lt; and then the use of Presence's Reports as ways to unveil a lot of backstories, but in a completely artificial way, not embedded in the scenario at all. There is no buildup, no hints, no quest for truth, none of that. Everything falls into our lap easily. We get used to following the Abidan's subplot, therefore they lose their mystique. &gt;!The ascension, arguably the pinnacle of a sacred artist's earthly life, is completely inconsequential when it happens to the MC's crew because by this point we have gotten really used to the Abidan.!&lt; I think it was a really bad idea to not strictly follow the MC's viewpoint. Even Eithan's ""surprise"" (if you know, you know), arguably the biggest plot twist of the series, felt not that exciting and too predictable.
* I want to say there is no world-building. This is not totally true because the world is vast, with multiple territories and continents on Cradle, as well as other iterations, sectors, the Way, the Abidan, the Vroshnir, the Void. However, all of this is barely explored. We know nothing of the cultures of any civilization, except that it seems like sacred artists are everywhere. The author made Lindon rush from progression to progression because of artificial deadlines (can't count the number of powerful people Lindon antagonized by killing their sons/nephews; yet another trope), which left zero space for world/civilization exploration.
* **The ending is disappointing, and major questions are left unanswered:**
   * Why was the Labyrinth built? Who were its creators &gt;!(yes, it's the first 7 judges!&lt;, but we would've liked some backstory)? Why did they create the Dreadgods (yes, &gt;!it's to trap Hunger madra!&lt;, but they also knew it would ruin the world...)?
   * How was &gt;!the Abidan civilization created by the first judges from Cradle!&lt;? How did they discover and conquer and become the guardians of the Way? How/Why did they create the Eladari Pact?
   * Same for the Vroshnir: their motives are really hard to understand. Same for the &gt;!Madking!&lt;, it all seems very superficial.
   * We learn nothing of the multiple worlds of the Way; it is left unexplored. Honestly, I don't understand that. &gt;!The author spends 12 books teasing us about what is beyond Cradle, but as soon as the MC ascends, the series ends. The Way, infinitely larger than Cradle, is never explored?! !&lt;It would've been better to spend 1/3 of the series in Cradle and the other 2/3 exploring the Way.
* &gt;!The MC is not the one who gets rid of the Main Antagonist (Madking). This problem gets solved even before the MC makes it to the Way.!&lt; It's like if, in Naruto, Madara or Kaguya had been killed by the older Kages without Naruto needing to step up to the challenge.
* I don't like the MC. It seems like the only two words that can come out of his mouth are ""Gratitude"" and ""Apologies"". He's a very shallow character.

**Bingo Square: Dreams - Womb City by Tlotlo Tsamaase**

**Score:** 2 out of 5

Womb City takes place a far future Botswana. The main character, Nelah is a successful and wealthy woman, except that she's microchipped as a potential criminal, forced to undergo dystopian levels of scrutiny and testing.


It's a combination of cyberpunk and transhumanism, mashed together in a horrifying and brutal dystopia that is motivated by misogyny and body autonomy. 


Unfortunately for me, it was an equally brutal read. 


Womb City could be broken down into parts - the first part, maybe a hundred pages or so is a kind of cyberpunk/1984/feminist story of a woman who is beaten down by an oppressive system and the heartless cruelty of a bureaucracy that is constructed to constantly disadvantage women. 


Then it becomes something else. Nelah is involved in a drug-fueled hit and run. The consequence of her being caught would be the complete destruction of her legacy, the death of her unborn child growing in an artificial womb, and her consciousness removed from her body and tortured for eternity in a cyberspace prison. 


The book then shifts to a bloody and gruesome horror as the victim of the hit and run returns to life and begins to terrorize Nelah. She is forced to endure her family members being brutally murdered by the ghost of her victim, with no way to stop the ghost and no source of help, she struggles futility to save her family. 


Then the book shifts again to a strange conspiracy theory involving the government and a supernatural force of nature that ties to African folklore. 


While that all sounds exciting on paper, this book is just too slow. Each new twist just piles on top of the last and there's all these ideas colliding with each other that nothing really gets the time or space needed to breath and really hit the reader. It's a huge shame because there are glimpses of great ideas. There's one section where Nelah has a debate about trying to be moral in a morally bankrupt system. It's genuinely really thought provoking.  


Unfortunately, too many of Womb City's ideas are smothered and not given the needed space to allow those interesting explorations. Combined with the pace of the story, which is challenging. There's a lot of repetition of the emotional trauma of the characters, we are constantly reminded of how upset they are, how frustrated they are. Yet the key parts of the story are buried in exposition that doesn't seem to matter or have any impact on the story. 



**Bingo Square: Under the Surface - System Collapse by Martha Wells**

**Score:** 4.3 out of 5


I've been looking forward to this read for awhile. I devoured the Murderbot Diaries books last year and was pleased as pie to see that the last one - System Collapse fit in the fantasy bingo. 


System Collapse is the latest book in the Murderbot Diaries series and takes place immediately after  the events of Network Effect. This story follows Murderbot and it's friends in an journey underground to contact a long lost colony that may or may not have been infected by the alien contamination last seen in Network Effect. 


In an obvious and delightful play on irony, the adventure into a dark and dusty, isolated and potentially dangerous place mirrors the internal plight of Murderbot as it struggles with [redacted]. Indeed, I think this is the biggest delve into Murderbot's psyche so far. 


Wells does a great job once again with fast paced action, tense moments, and funny but also emotionally meaningful moments. It's surprising how she's able to make you care so much about Murderbot and pull on your heart strings. 


System Collapse also really demonstrates some nice character growth. This isn't the same cast we first met in All Systems Red, they've grown and expanded and it's a pleasure to see how far they've come. 


It's also a quick read, like all the Murderbot books. It's not particularly dense or complicated, although if its been a while since you read one, all the names and places might be a bit confusing. It's also a relatively positive series. There are some dark moments but ultimately the growth of the characters is optimistic and insightful. 


Overall, I really hope we see more in the near future and get to see more character growth.  


**Bingo Square: Character with a disability - Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse**

**Score:** 4 out of 5


Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse is an epic fantasy with chosen ones, characters with hidden magical talents, deadly warriors, political intrigue and some cloak and dagger. 


What sets this apart for so so much epic fantasy is the back drop is an imagined pre-Columbian world of Indigenous societies. Inspiration is taken from Mesoamerican cultures, as well as Polynesian and North American Indigenous. 


There are three main story lines - Serapio the character with the disability is probably the strongest element in the book. Although I think enjoyed the character of Xiala more. The story follows a quest for revenge against past wrongs but also the conflicting motivations behind that drive for revenge. 


It brings a number of different elements together, the adventuring quest and the intrigue of courtly politics. 


I did find that the intrigue and politics was the weakest element. The character of Naranpa felt the least developed and I often had a hard time understanding why she did the things she did. Perhaps the naivety and poor decision making was intentional to help underline the premise that the Sun Priests were hopelessly corrupt. But unfortunately I did find it detracted a bit from the story.   


Nevertheless, there's a lot to like here. I thought the central conflict was actually really engaging. There's an on-going theme of value of vengeance, of whether the ends justify the means. I don't know if the themes continue in the next books, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of sympathy for Serapio as much of his ""gifts"" seem to come not out of love or support but rather a shocking lack of empathy for him as a person. 


Overall, Black Sun is worth your time.",fantasy

Song or playlist to enhance an epic fantasy story ,"I recently finished the Faithful and the Fallen series. And for the the final battle in the last book, this song came on as I was reading and I ended up putting on repeat for the entire battle!

It just took that battle to a whole new level for m and seemed to fit in exactly with the high stakes, the ebb and flow of the battle and the unbelievable drama taking place page after page. I found myself nearly breathless between the action I was reading and the music thrumming in my ears. 

Does anyone else have a go-to playlist or song for their epic reads or had a moment like this when a song just absolutely enhanced their reading experience?

Can someone please Tell Me Why Name of The Wind Is so highly regarded?,"When I picked it up two days ago, I tweeted this on my twitter account:



""Starting the game changing fantasy of the 2000s: Name of The wind""



Well I'm done with it now and I still am unable to see anything major that made it a game changer for the late 2000s Fantasy books. Closest I can think of is maybe it's unorthodox use of the Sword and Sorcery template with the magic school setting and a somewhat hard magic system being combined in a setting such as that. So maybe that's what blew the minds of most back in the day or maybe it's the narrative frame it helped popularised ig. 

Cuz honestly the prose is nothing so stellar to afford that (Maybe having read likes of Tad Williams and Guy Gavriel adds to this for me idk) nor are the characters who all ultimately fall flat because they feel like place holders for Kvothe to showcase just how much superior to them he is in either intellect or charm or both and not especially the story being told which felt meandering once it hit the halfway point down to the very end which just made the payoff lacklustre to me. 



So ultimately to me, it's the most just decent book I've read all year even more ""just above average"" than The Will of The Many. Will not be checking out the wise man's fear.  Barely a 3 ⭐ helped in large part by the interesting magic system.",fantasy

Priory of the Orange Tree: Should I finish it?,"Hi everyone!

Several months ago I placed a hold on Priory of the Orange Tree on Libby because I saw it highly recommended on both Reddit and TikTok. I finally was able to check it out a couple of weeks ago, and since then I’ve only read 225 pages. The book being long doesn’t phase me, but having read 225 pages and feeling… meh does.

I’m not disliking it persay, but so far it hasn’t gripped me, I guess. I don’t find myself WANTING to read any chance I get with this book, which is why it’s taken me 3+ weeks to read the same number of pages that I can normally read in 1-2 days.

So I guess my question is, should I DNF? Does it get better, or do you think I will continue to feel meh about it?

Thanks everyone

EDIT: This post has been up for just over an hour and every comment is telling me it doesn’t get better, lol. DNF. Thanks all for your help.

If anyone is interested, I’m going to read Paladin’s Strength by T. Kingfisher instead. I’ve read two of her books so far, including Paladin’s Grace, and have enjoyed them both. I recommend if you want lighter, funny fantasy! But most if not all of you probably already know about her",fantasy

I've been ruined by video games and ttrpg's. Help.,"I'm currently working on creating magic types for my world, and as someone who's played video games or things like dnd, the magic in there has a VERY specific purpose.

Which is, give the player new abilities and make them feel powerful.

However, I KNOW this shouldn't be the crux of magic in a story, because that just makes for a boring system used to serve the character.

 I'm working through different types of magic and their applications, and just need some help on how to make it feel organic and intentional. I don't want it to feel too loose, or soft, within the narrative, because it can be used to just bail out the characters. I also don't want it to just seem like a numbers game of who's got the biggest stats, because guy 1 has bigger fireballs than guy 2.

Fantasy where the land/environment is an antagonist?,"I’m curious if anyone has recommendations for fantasy books where the environment is an antagonist and major plot point. Traveling is dangerous, even for experienced travelers.

The main fantasy examples I know are The Hobbit and LOTR. Tolkien went out of his way to say “just traveling is dangerous. Now their rations are getting low, now it’s raining and cold and miserable, now they sheltered somewhere for two weeks to regain strength and morale.” Even just basic things like “Spring was coming on,” or “in Hobbiton they’ll be harvesting right now” gives a sense of connection to the land that I feel missing in modern fantasy.

Other non-fantasy books that give similar vibes are Hatchet and My Side of the Mountain. I don’t need the whole story to be about surviving in the woods, but I’d like some nods to acknowledge that traveling hundreds of miles through wilderness isn’t an “easy” thing that should get hand-waved away. 

Thanks for any suggestions!",fantasy

"They say to never meet your heroes, but Joe Abercrombie proved that's not the case...","I am an absolute Joe Abercrombie nut and an aspiring author yada yada... absolutely love his works and have always had the sense that he's a real genuine bloke through interviews and whatnot.

So when I was walking down the street and he turned round the corner, you can imagine that I was starstruck - it would be the equivalent of most of Gen Z seeing their favourite sport/pop star.

It wasn't a lengthy encounter but I effectively interrupted him and his wife to frenetically express my adulation, and he was really lovely, asked questions, seemed to take an interest and not just smile and look to be on his way.

He's literally my favourite author in the fantasy circle and this only reinforces my unmitigated love for his work and deepens the influence that he has had on my own fledgling works.",fantasy
I'm caving and giving Fourth Wing a try,"I usually avoid booktok hyped books because I very rarely end up enjoying them. But dragons are my weak spot and I'm intrigued enough by the premise of this book. What was everyone's reading experience when they read Fourth Wing? 

For reference, I tried ACOTAR years ago and hated it. I did read One Dark Window recently and surprisingly enjoyed it, but that's about my extent of booktok romantasy I've tried.

Expectations for Malazan,"Recently I ordered a copy of Gardens of the Moon because the series is my Grandpa’s favorite and he’s always wanted me to read it. 

I’ve heard the series is amazing, but also really confusing and one of those series you have to actively put effort into reading every sentence to fully comprehend. 

Just wanted to get my expectations in place for book one before starting it. Is it like WoT where I need notes on characters? Or more like a Stormlight where I need to take notes on the world and certain details that imply other things? Or should I just read and figure it out on my own?

If you guys could tell me what to expect that’d be awesome, thanks!",fantasy

Book Review: Swordcrossed by Freya Marske,"**TL;DR Review:** High on the steam, spice, and sass. An insightful exploration of the burdens of duty and the cost of desire.

https://preview.redd.it/sq7zeigh78td1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d05c009eb89ed0c47eadfb2f458ff9190b62d2

**Full Review:**

Mattinesh Jay—or *Matti,* to his friends—is fighting to keep a grip on his family’s fortunes, and pinching every penny in his efforts to just stay afloat a little bit longer until his marriage to a rich heiress saves their noble House. He needs money to hire a “best man”, a duelist to stand at his side at the wedding in case a rival challenges the marriage. Which he *knows* someone will do, because someone has made it clear they’re madly in love with the same heiress.

But his streak of ill luck continues when his stag night revelry ends in a broken watch that costs him a significant chunk of what he’s set aside to hire a duelist. He’s forced to pay for a cheaper—and potentially less talented—best man.

Who turns out to be the very man whose watch he broke.

Luca Piere is a talented duelist but an even more talented con artist. He lies as easily as he breathes, flits his way through the world with a smile and a laugh, and can charm his way into and out of any situation. Except he’s met his match with Matti. Matti’s no-nonsense, businesslike approach to life cuts right through Luca’s nonsense. Luca’s offer to stand as his best man/duelist is one-upped by Matti’s demand that Luca teach him to fence.

And thus begins their days of crossing blades—and, soon, stealing glances and a whole lot more.

The banter between Matti and Luca was an absolute delight. Luca is quick-tongued and sharp-witted, but Matti’s no slouch in the quip and zinger department. It’s clear from the very beginning that though their personalities may seem opposite, they’ve got the potential to be the perfect match.

Matti’s direct, efficient nature is contrasted wonderfully by Luca’s airy, happy-go-lucky, smile-and-wink approach to life. Matti helps Luca take life more seriously and Luca helps Matti to unclench. I loved the exploration of Matti’s struggles, the weight he’s carried in his duties to his family and his House—duties that are no less burdensome despite the fact that he’s doing it out of love. At the same time, Luca’s outward flippancy and breeziness hides deep pain, and through the time spent with Matti, we see what it has cost him in the past.

As their relationship develops, there is a risk that it will interfere with Matti’s marriage—and the salvation of his House. Obviously this presents a wrinkle to his story. I won’t spoil the outcome, but I will say that I LOVED how this aspect wrapped up. It was a delicious ending with a twist that I absolutely loved (and can honestly say I didn’t see coming).

Alongside their simmering romance—which is as steamy and spicy as you’d expect—there’s an interesting look into the business of Matti’s House, and the mystery of how things have gotten so bad is explored. Luca’s con artistry and thief skills come in quite handy in this endeavour, while Matti’s head for business and insights into commerce create an excellent balance.

By the end, you can see exactly why these two are perfect for each other. What begins as “opposites attract” winds up being the very reason that each is drawn to the other, and how each’s strengths helps the other to conquer their weakness.

From start to finish, it’s a well-crafted relationship that is believable and enjoyable to read, set in a fascinating fantasy world evocative of Renaissance Italy.",fantasy
ISO recommendations for excellently written fantasy novels to contrast with Terry Brooks,"BLUF: I would like recommendations for sci-fi/fantasy books that have both an excellent plot AND excellent writing.

I loved the Shannara books as a kid and read many of them; probably most of them. I stopped reading for a long time as an adult and have just started getting back into it. I decided to re-read the Shannara series and, to my disappointment, I’ve realized that Terry Brooks is not a very good writer. In fact, I really hated The Fall of Shannara series. They were so bad, maybe his worst.

To get to the point, I am wondering now what it is like to read a well-written book. I’ve read several sci-fi/fantasy books that had a good plot but the writing was bad. I would like recommendations for books that have both an excellent plot AND excellent writing. This will probably make the rest of Terry Brooks completely unreadable, but they always say that you shouldn’t re-watch childhood favorites anyway. I suppose that must also be true of books.

priory of the orange tree/day of fallen night open discussion,"i just want to preface this with the statement that i love priory and i think the series is amazing so far and i hope we get more books. 

but when the main characters are talking about the order of magic-using women at the priory, they mention that only women can eat from the orange tree. but then they mention that people who feel like they want to can effectively transition to women from men. i am nonbinary myself and i appreciate the inclusion, but it opens up a huge plot hole for me: why doesn’t every man transition then? bc only women can access the power, so why leave that option open at all if the alternative is effectively a second class status at the priory?

did anyone else who’s read the book notice this? am i overthinking the magic system? was this explained in the book and i missed it? it’s been a year since i finished day of fallen night",fantasy
Reading Through Mists: A Lud-in-the-Mist Read-Along - Chapter 28,"##[Series Index - If you’re new to this read-along, start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BiggerBetterFaster/comments/gn4lk4/reading\_through\_mists\_a\_reading\_guide\_to/?)
&amp;nbsp;
Quite proud of this one.
&amp;nbsp;
#Chapter 28: On a Moonlit Night
&amp;nbsp;
And now finally, Nathaniel reaches his destination, the one he didn’t know he was heading towards. Back on the road toward Fairy, Nathaniel is stopped by harsh wind. Clouds cover the moon, and all he has to warm himself is nostalgia for his bed. 

&amp;nbsp;
And then the wind stops, the moon shines, and his horse dies. But it doesn’t matter, because the man himself is here.

&amp;nbsp;
Duke Aubrey is ready to meet Master Nathaniel Chanticleer.

###The Note
&amp;nbsp;
Nathaniel hears the Note one more time, but this time, his response to it is different: Rather than symbolizing the fragility and temporary nature of things, it reminds him of missed opportunities and regrets. We’re now ready to talk about the nature of the Note.

&amp;nbsp;
If you remember, the book opens with a quote from Jane Harrison. I’ll put it here as a reminder:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;The Sirens stand, as it would seem, to the ancient and the modern, for the impulses in life as yet immortalised, imperious longings, ecstasies, whether of love or art, or philosophy, magical voices calling to a man from his ""Land of Heart's Desire,"" and to which if he hearken it may be that he will return no more - voices, too, which, whether a man sail by or stay to hearken, still sing on

&amp;nbsp;
Shortly after reading this, we read about Nathaniel’s encounter with the Note. It’s easy to make the connection between the two, and since a siren’s song and a note are musical in nature, it’s also easy to jump to the conclusion that the Note is that siren song for Nathaniel, calling him away from his “Land of Heart’s Desire”.

&amp;nbsp;
But if we think about it, that doesn’t work. A siren’s call is meant to draw you in, but Nathaniel is repulsed by the Note. Now, when he is on the other side of his adventure, he hears the Note differently - it was his calling, telling him to go on the adventure. The siren’s call were all the earthly comforts he so valued, and latched on to, until he dreaded being away from them so much that the Note became a thing to avoid at all cost.

&amp;nbsp;
For years, Nathaniel has harkened to the call of his sirens, and whenever an opportunity to go on an epic quest presented itself in the form of the Note, he runs towards his home instead. Only once, for Ranulph, did Nathaniel finally go on to follow his calling. Now, when he hears the Note, it represents all the times he could’ve, would’ve, should’ve, but didn’t. And it breaks his heart. 

&amp;nbsp;
But he wishes to hear it again, to have a calling once more.

###Duke Aubrey
The Duke calls Nathaniel “John-o’-dreams” which is a mocking nickname borrowed from Shakespeare. In Hamlet, the titular prince calls himself “John-o’-dreams” as a form of berating himself, in a soliloquy starting with “O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!”:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Yet I,

&gt;A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak

&gt;Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,

&gt;And can say nothing—no, not for a king

&gt;Upon whose property and most dear life

&gt;A damned defeat was made.


&amp;nbsp;
Hamlet is using the term as a form of mockery, but the literal meaning is nothing more than ‘dreamer’. Aubrey is referring to Nathaniel by his title, but he finds a subtly disrespectful way to do so. 

&amp;nbsp;
The Duke is far more of a deity than he is human. If Leer referring to him as “the Lord of Life and Death” didn’t clue you into that. As such, he sees Nathaniel as his follower and commends him on making the pilgrimage. Nathaniel repeats what he has decided in the last chapter, that he has never tasted fairy fruit, so cannot be Duke Aubrey’s follower. The Duke’s answer is an interesting one:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;""There are many trees in my orchard, and many and various are the fruit they bear—music and dreams and grief and, sometimes, joy. All your life, Chanticleer, you have eaten fairy fruit,.”

&amp;nbsp;
We should have no issue decoding this by now: Just because Nathaniel never took on any artistic endevour of his own, it does not mean that his life was devoid of art. In fact, considering his love of beautiful, ancient things and his tendency to pretend the world is different than it is, he might just be the biggest eater of fairy fruit in all of Lud. 

###The Face of the Moon and the Four in the Orchard 

&amp;nbsp;
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, as Nathaniel meets Duke Aubrey, the moon is shining in full. And yet, didn't Endymion Leer assert that Fairyland is a land “where the moon and the sun do not shine?” 

&amp;nbsp;
When he said that during the trial, I felt something was off. Throughout the book, the moon is mentioned in relation to Fairy. The name “Moonlove”, we are told, has its origins in Fairy. Ranulph yells at Nathaniel to not kill the moon or “all the flowers will wither in Fairyland.” And now we have proof - Nathaniel arrives at Fairyland, and the moon indeed shines. How come Leer got it wrong?

&amp;nbsp;
To understand this mystery, I’d like to use the old Kabalist tale of the four who entered The Pardes (Pardes being the Hebrew word for orchard, but in the case of this tale, it could probably be interpreted as ‘paradise’). Of the four rabbis who enter, one dies, one loses his mind, one becomes a heathen, and only one, Rabbi Akiva goes in peace and leaves in peace, achieving enlightenment. 

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; Rabbi Akiva said to them, ""When you come to the place of pure marble stones, do not say, 'Water! Water!' for it is said, 'He who speaks untruths shall not stand before My eyes’”

&amp;nbsp;
In other words, while others may be deceived by the marble and call it water, only Rabbi Akiva was not fooled and could reach beyond.

&amp;nbsp;
Why am I telling you this? Because I think there is an interesting parallel between Nathaniel and Endymion Leer, and Rabbi Akiva and the Other who became a heathen (Elisha Ben Avuya, but he's literally called the Other in the Talmud for his blasphemy). The Other was deceived and could not stand before god, but presumably, he believed himself to be righteous and that Rabbi Akiva was the heathen. Like him, Endymion Leer believed he had the moral high ground, and that Nathaniel was the one who stood against what was right.

&amp;nbsp;
From Leer’s description of fairyland, we might deduce that he visited the place, and when the wind picked up and the moon hid her face, he believed he had reached his destination. But much like Rabbi Akiva who was not fooled by the marble, Nathaniel pushed through the moonless night. He makes it to the other side and finds that there is a moon, and in her light, he meets Duke Aubrey. 

&amp;nbsp;
Was Mirrlees making an oblique reference here? Well, it's possible that as a classist’s mentee, she knew about the Talmudic tale, and there are several mentions of metaphorical orchards, but I don’t think we can say for sure. Rather, the story of the four in the Pardes is useful for us to highlight the interesting relationship between Leer and Chanticleer. One is a foil to the other, yes, but ideologically they are not as opposed as they might first appear: they have both walked the same figurative path. Endymion Leer did not see it to the end, and came out with flawed conclusions, due to either cowardice or selfishness or both. 

&amp;nbsp;
In Chapter 26, Leer wonders what sin he has committed that led to Aubrey deserting him. Well, here it is. His sin is blasphemy – though he believes he saw fairyland, he in fact did not. His actions from then on are therefore tainted. He is a fake, even though he tragically doesn’t know it.

&amp;nbsp;
Nathaniel, on the other hand, sheds away the hubris that has infected both him and Leer as the story progresses. Now, near the end of the story, he has given up the comfort of his home, his title, his authority over others, and even his identity. He reaches Fairyland and meets Duke Aubrey. 

&amp;nbsp;
###Columbine, For the Last Time
&amp;nbsp;
Columbine makes its final appearance in this chapter. I’ve mentioned before that Mirrlees didn’t write the song, save for two verses. The first, which we encounter during the Crabapple Blossom’s dance lesson, goes like this:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;""Any lass for a Duke, a Duke who wears green,
In lands where the sun and the moon do not shine,”

&amp;nbsp;
The second, in this chaper, says this:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;""There are windfalls of dreams, there's a wolf in the stars,
And Life is a nymph who will never be thine,”

&amp;nbsp;
I think we can read these two verses as being the implementation of the same ideology by two very different minds. In Endymion Leer’s version, the ends justify any means, as long as the Duke get his due, and there is no point in trying to find rhyme or reason in it (the sun and the moon do not shine). In Nathaniel’s version, however, there is risk and reward (windfall and wolf) and the reason is not for the benefit of a nebulous duke, but for the chase itself (men chase nymphs in myth, even if they will never catch them). Both verses are part of the same song, yes, but they are drastically different in their approach. 

&amp;nbsp;
In the final passage of the chapter, the Duke gives Nathaniel a vision. At first, we might think that it is a vision of Fairyland, but note the wording:

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;It was not unlike Dorimare, or rather, the transfigured Dorimare he had once seen from the Fields of Grammary. And as he gazed he knew that in that land no winds ever howled at night, and that everything within its borders had the serenity and stability of trees, the unchanging peace of pictures.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
The Duke gave Nathaniel a vision of Dorimare at the height of peace and prosperity. 

&amp;nbsp;
And then the vision vanishes. Was it nothing but a dream?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Western-created settings with Asian influence,"Alright, this might be a niche topic, but I'm thinking about works created by Westerners that adopt an ostensibly western-inspired setting but which draws from typical Asian aesthetics, cultural elements and tropes, such as wuxia and xianxia, samurai and ninjas, honor-based ethos, and so forth. 

Basically that would be the opposite of an Eastern anime/manga/manhwa that adopts a western-based setting such as Frieren and Berserk.

Two examples to illustrate: 

1. In Mortal Kombat, Outworld and other Realms besides Earthrealm (Seido and even Edenia come to mind) are for no reason based in Eastern Asian aesthetics, while the setting features ninjas, oni, jinsei, gods with Eastern trappings and so forth.

2. The Exalted RPG features heavy Asian inspiration, with emphasis in martial arts, mighty godly emperors, Super Sentai style armors. Yet, obviously, these serve more as the varnish than actually as the substrate, it is still heavily anchored in epic/mythic Fantasy.

Do you know any other examples to share?",fantasy

The Book Of New Sun Gets weirder but also better with every book.,"Just got done reading **Sword Of The Lictor** and it's my favourite of the 3 books so far &amp; such the first 5 ⭐️ of the 3 yet. I think in this book I have now started to like Severian as a person not just as a character (Person he is rn beyond past transgressions)

This book lacked a major mainstay companion (I mean one that stays so long with him tho maybe little severian could count as that too in a sense) as with the previous 2 &amp; as such no standout new character, well none with much layers as the others but what it lacked here it traded for the most development for Severian so far. He’s a lot more contemplative of not just his own actions and ideals but of the universe itself and the scenarios Wolfe sprawled up for him as adventures or misadventures if you like only served to enhance that even more.

From how he abandoned his Lictor post in Thrax, his farewell to Dorcas to the Alzabo encounter down to little severian’s adoption (his death crushed me, didn't expect it at all and not especially in the manner it happened in tbh) down to the revelations with Typhon, The Hierodules and Baldanders &amp; Dr Talos.

All of these revelations especially with the latter two have retroactively enhanced the whole journey from the first 2 books already &amp; I can only imagine how much more this enhancement will appear with rereads or even after I read Citadel of the Autarch. Sections such as the Eschatology and Genesis play particularly how it ended, the Jolenta dynamic, the Autarchy all have developed deeper layers in light of this book.

I had my suspicions about the dynamics of Dr Talos and Baldanders and even the make up of Baldanders himself seeing as he's essentially a giant but I didn’t at all expect Baldanders was the Doctor here &amp; Dr Talos the Frankenstein monster (I figure that’s what a homunculus is). I appreciate that his abnormal size is explained as proper gigantism syndrome as in the clinical sense.  It's easy to forget this is ultimately sci -fi no matter how alien or fantastical sthe elements in it appear to be. In light of this, I'm now most curious to see how the claw's apparent time altering powers is explained tbh. The seems too far fetched for simply science but I'll let Wolfe scientifically reveal his world and it's mechanism to me as he's mostly succeeded so far.

The deal with the Hierodules I’ve got a reading for but I’m gonna leave it to RAFO in the next book cuz I’m expecting it to come to the forefront there. The Frog boy tale I admit I couldn’t understand much of what occurred during my read much more it’s message but I was informed by rereading Wolfe twitter user that it’s based on The Jungle book and as such I’ll reread that section specifically thought that lens before I start Citadel.

Also during this read I’ve found myself thinking a lot about TBONS beyond the pages and off that alone, it has more than impressed me as only a few media manage to do that for me and not especially when I’m yet to properly place a visage to what the story at hand is.

All in all it’s easily 5 stars and a top 5 reads this year for me and I can’t wait to join the war plot with Severian in Citadel of the Autarch as soon as possible.",fantasy

"[Review] Jam Reads: The Bloodless Prince, by Charlotte Bond","https://preview.redd.it/7ea6gq7y9dtd1.jpg?width=938&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee83183366caaeb5e6adb4c257a757acfd787361

[Review originally on JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/the-bloodless-princes-the-fireborne-blade-2-by-charlotte-bond)

Th*e Bloodless Princes* is the thrilling second novella in *the Fireborne Blade* series, an epic fantasy proposal written by Charlotte Bond, and published by TorDotCom. A sequel to *the Fireborne Blade* that explores the underworld of this universe created by Charlotte Bond, while developing the relationship between Saralene and Maddileh, in a plot that still has surprises for us, blending together *Orpheus* with *A Natural History of Dragons*.

Cursed by the previous practitioner in her role, High Mage Saralene visits the afterlife with a boon to beg of the Bloodless Princes, two entities that rule the underworld, all following the advice given by the White Lady. Separated from sir Maddileh, her protector, she will have to navigate the afterlife city, discovering that all research might be inaccurate; and that appearances and concepts such as justice can be difficult to apply if they are taken to the extreme.   
On the other side, we have a sir Maddileh that will need to take an alternative route to reach the afterlife, together with a new companion (and I don't want to spoil this surprise, because I absolutely loved it) and armed with her Fireborne Blade; reuniting with Saralene will just be the first of the challenges she will have to face, and probably the easiest in comparison with how complicated are her feelings for Saralene.

In this sequel, Bond offers a unique vision of the afterlife, a complicated world ruled by two brothers and which represents opposite poles of the same vision; it is interesting how the concept of good and bad gets substituted by a big gray morality, symbolizing how things are not simple.   
The lore of the world is expanded, including more stories that are introduced as interludes across our main plot; dragons are still relevant, but pass to play a secondary role.

We have a really intense sequel from the emotional standpoint, as the author explores the relationship between Saralene and Maddileh, how they are attracted and how their roles can be a barrier; not only that, but also the fear of being rejected by the other, choosing to stay in a middle situation that doesn't satisfy anybody. It also mimics that fear that queer people have of being discovered and deemed as weird, or being ostracised by those that they love.

*The Bloodless Princes* is an excellent second novella, the perfect close-up for this duology, and again shows Bond's talent to create a compelling story; if you want a great and feminist take-up on epic fantasy, I totally recommend you to read *The Fireborne Blade* duology.",fantasy
Duncan Hamilton's Wolf of the North Trilogy,"This might be a strange request. I got this book trilogy on audible and I just...I can't get through it.

I'm done.

Any books or stories where a mythically long-lived race/species deals with old age or aging in general?,"I don’t know how to change this flair, but this isn’t a deal

I keep thinking about Tolkien’s elves, and how they had this sense that they were fading, but that was tied to some supernatural sense tied to Valinor. It got me thinking if anyone’s ever written about something like elves, but more mundane. 

Like at 15,372, Fingolthir got his first gray hair, and that kicked off a series of events where the race has to figure out what these changes mean. 

The, I think, kind of obvious twist is this: &gt;!one of them dies and all of sudden everyone has to deal with mortality!&lt;

Book Review: Blood of the Old Kings by Sung-Il Kim,"**TL;DR Review:** Compelling, colorful, and complex. Epic storytelling that sinks into your bones and keeps you turning pages.

https://preview.redd.it/z5550207pctd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0ff06666b3acaf078fff6fc065aa8e78093545b

**Full Review:**

*Blood of the Old Kings* had me intrigued from the very first page. Heck, the first *paragraph.*

A dragon with too many eyes locked away by magic in a volcano, a desperate woman willing to make a deal for the salvation of her people, and a promise of vengeance against an all-powerful conquering Empire.

For **Loran,** the deaths of her husband and daughter are the only thing driving her to take up the dragon’s sword against the Empire. She will cut her way through their armies, defeat their magic, and destroy their mightiest creations—and in so doing, become the Princess and ultimately the King her people need.

Her story is the most compelling of the POV characters, and the most dynamic. She begins fighting alone, but through her courage and resilience, winds up joining forces with a ragtag band of rebels that may have a chance at becoming an *army.* Spitting in the face of the Empire could cost her everything—but the price is worth paying to free her people.

**Cain** is an ordinary-seeming young man working for an oil vendor, but there’s so much more to him than meets the eye. Sort of a grifter/spy/smuggler combination, he finds himself drawn into a quest for revenge against the ones who murdered the woman who saved him and kept him alive during his earliest days on the streets of the Empire’s capital city.

His story feels smaller, but it gives us a fascinating look into the “Ministry of Intelligence”, the shadow arm of the Empire’s police force. He is drawn into their tangled web by the chance to unmask his friend’s killer. But what he discovers could lead to the death—or salvation—of the Empire he has good cause to hate as an outsider.

**Arienne** is a mage, gifted with the ability to control magic and trained in the Empire’s most prestigious school. Only that school doesn’t actually teach her anything except ways of keeping her body and mind in shape to be a “Power generator” after her death. Because *of course* the Empire runs on the corpses of their mages—that’s what powers everything from their lights to their most advanced weapons.

But a mysterious voice in her head leads her to break free of the mage school and sets her fleeing into the farthest corners of the Empire. She and her new companion are hunted by the “Order of Truth”, those tasked with keeping mages firmly in line, and have to cross desolate terrain, dense forests, and icy mountain passes in the desperate hope of finding somewhere safe from their clutches. Though she has no understanding of magic to begin with, every trial and test she endures will teach her more—and more about herself, too.

*Blood of the Old Kings* is a fascinating story of a fight for freedom–freedom from oppression, from control over magic, from being told how you have to live your life. I particularly loved the message inherent into Loran’s story: it doesn’t take blood to make a princess or King, only the courage to stand up and show the people what it means to lead.

The world is rich and colorful, with so many fascinating cultures and customs that shade each captured kingdom with wondrous nuance.

Fans of K.S. Villoso’s *Chronicles of the Wolf Queen* and R.F. Kuang’s *The Poppy War* will feel right at home in this story!",fantasy
What’s your Epic Fantasy unpopular favorite character? ,"Mine is Theon Greyjoy from A Song of Ice and Fire.

It’s not the fact that I can personally relate to his struggles as a guy who was kidnapped as a child and raised away from my family, it’s his endless stupidity that makes him a great read.

John Gwynne’s violent Norse-themed grimdark trilogy, The Bloodsworn Saga reaches its inevitably bloody conclusion in [The Fury of The Gods](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FURY-OF-THE-GODS.jpg). For those among us, who are ready for battle, helm on head, axe in hand, seax in belt, with rage flowing through your veins as you face your enemy across the field, this book is for you!


I thoroughly enjoyed the introduction to the world of the Bloodsworn in The Shadow of the Gods. With all the bells and whistles of a Viking-themed world, I was already heavily invested, and positively biased. The characters were engaging in their regard, and there were plenty of high-octane action set-pieces to get the blood pumping—all part of the recipe for a strong start of a new series. The culmination of Shadow introduces the mythological elements by introducing the big-bad wolf (literally) and the bigger-badder dragon as the major world turners for the series.

The Hunger of the Gods fleshed out much of the character motivations a little deeper, giving more nuance to the mainstay characters of the series, Orka Skullsplitter and Varg No-Sense of the Bloodsworn and Elvar of the Battlegrim. The sequel allowed for the world and characters to expand and grow into more distinct archetypes, with no character fulfilling the stereotypical “hero” role (this is grimdark after all!). The major themes involve rescuing various children abducted by the villains who serve the major antagonist, the dragon Lik-Rifa and her cult of worshippers. The book even spends some time with the “villains” to add another angle to the story, to reasonable success. In this series, the list of major Gods have extended to the dragon Lik-Rifa, the wolf Ulfrir, and the devious rat Rotta.

All of this was to set up the inevitable final showdown between the forces of “good” and “evil” in the finale, The Fury of the Gods. In truth, Fury is mostly just a novel-length battle ensemble. While both Shadow and Hunger had plenty of large scale battle set pieces, there was plenty of plot movement outside of those sets to give the books weight and narrative direction. However, the finale ended up being Gwynne’s way of neatly tying together all of the character arcs and the narrative arc, by ramming them against each other. The first couple of chapters help move the pieces across the board towards the final battle location, and by about halfway, we are dropped in to the final battle.

Gwynne is a master, perhaps among the best in the biz right now for writing well-crafted and thoroughly researched battle scenes, owing to his extensive real world experience as a Viking re-enacter and a battle scholar. His other famous fantasy series have been universally praised for its dense battle narration, and The Fury of The Gods is no different. If you're someone who’s tuning in for bloody bladed escapism, this novel is the perfect romp for you. However, if you want something more from your culmination of a dark-fantasy series, this book may feel a bit threadbare.

Gwynne does an impressive job pitting every character rivalry against each other in the final book, in a way that felt almost too neat, belying the entropic nature of war. Everyone got their comeuppance, mortal and gods. It felt too symmetrical. The motivations of the antagonists in particular began to veer into semi-cheesy territory. In contrast, many of the side characters surprisingly shone through in this book. In particular, the dynamic between Varg and Rokia and the Rat god Rotta and his underling the betrayer Biorr were very enjoyable and were the highlights of the book.

The Fury of the Gods and the Bloodsworn Saga has deeply explored themes of family that transcend blood and kin, which is a central feature of Viking culture as well, and the series does an amazing job of creating that atmosphere. It also explores themes of inclusion and bigotry as the characters who carry divine blood manifesting into their animalistic powers also put them on the receiving end of rampant persecution.

The narrative of this series has always been relatively straightforward, and readers can guess who will come out on top, but will enjoy the journey nonetheless, even though the plot armor on some of our favorites get so heavy that I found myself sighing more than once. You know who will make it, you know who won’t, with near-perfect accuracy. A case of “it’s the journey, not the destination that matters”. Especially when the big bads are taken out in a surprisingly anti-climactic way, perhaps impressing upon us that the true focus was the human side of the conflict all along.

This book left me divided between my internal bloodthirsty glee who revels in the violent side of grimdark fantasy, and the other more academic side of me who is trying to move past my own visceral tastes and chase deeper meaning. There is plenty of the former, but assessing this book from the latter’s vantage leaves me wanting.",fantasy

"I'm Karin Lowachee, author of the newly released (as of today in N. Am!) novella THE MOUNTAIN CROWN from Solaris Books. AMA.","[Out today in North America!](https://preview.redd.it/5q9qo13l7jtd1.jpg?width=249&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50501a52c10c575ab37321a0cf2fe01962da8d94)

Hello r/Fantasy! I'm Karin Lowachee, Canadian author of [THE MOUNTAIN CROWN](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Mountain-Crown/Karin-Lowachee/The-Crowns-of-Ishia/9781837862399), the first in a trilogy of novellas entitled **The Crowns of Ishia**. It's a literary frontier fantasy -- with dragons! Featuring a stalwart FMC named Méka, a one-handed war veteran named Lilley, and a powerful but troubled traitor named Raka. The three find themselves together on a mission to ""gather"" a king dragon in the Crown Mountains, and that's where the problems begin. Part of the kernel of this idea was born when I asked myself, *What if dragons were an essential part of the world's ecosystem? How would a people control the population of these apex predators? What would that relationship look like? And what would happen if such a relationship was threatened by war?*

I've been a published writer since my debut novel *Warchild* in 2002, the first in a military science fiction mosaic written more like memoirs. I'm interested in exploring the psychologies of my characters, especially when they aren't easy to define or comfortably palatable (as people don't tend to be). I've also written numerous short stories of various genres, dabbled in poetry, and I'm a regular film/TV columnist for *The* *Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction*.

Occasionally I've taught writing both online and in person, so be welcome to ask any craft questions! Some of my all-time favourite novels are: *Blood Meridian* by Cormac McCarthy, *Days Without End* by Sebastian Barry, *The Outsiders* by S.E. Hinton, *Drive* by James Sallis, and *Cyteen* by CJ Cherryh.

When I'm not writing, I'm a butler to a black cat. You can find me online at [karinlowachee.com](http://karinlowachee.com), and **I'll be giving away 5 e-copies of** ***THE MOUNTAIN CROWN*** in a random draw of those participating in the AMA today.

How many fantasy series have you finished and what was your favorite? ,"I’m running a little bit of an experiment here, I want to see if there’s a correlation between how prolific a fantasy reader an individual is, and his or her favorite series. 

So comment:
1. The number of series you’ve completed
2. The number series you’ve started but haven’t finished (read at least 1 book in the series)
3. Which series is your favorite. 

(If you’ve read all the published books in a series because the author hasn’t completed it yet, that counts as finishing the series). 

I’ll start:

I have finished 3 fantasy series, started 2, and my favorite was The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. 

If anyone is curious, the other series I finished were A Song of Ice and Fire and Harry Potter, and the series I started but haven’t finished are Narnia and Eragon. ",fantasy

High fantasy straight male authors who aren't letting the side down ,"Have only occasionally read high fantasy since my LOTR and Discworld phase in school and David Gemmell phase in uni. I've begun to get back into it with Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy (mixed bag, mostly enjoyed) and collecting recs of stuff that aren't too grimdark and depressing (which discounts GRRM, Joe Abercrombie, Robin Hobb, Glenn Cook). With that caveat, I've noticed the recs I'm getting are mostly women or queer men. 

So far in my straight male authors list are: Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams, David Eddings, Terry Brooks, Brandon Sanderson, Pierce Brown, Neil Gaiman, Scott Lynch. Of that list, two are accused sexual predators, two hardcore genocide supporters, and one guy who kept children in a cage. 😑 Like, c'mon. There has to be more worthwhile straight male authors to support. I've had Garth Nix recced to me but isn't he more for younger readers like Pullman and Riordan? 

There's a lot of difference in the writing styles between straight guys and women/queer folk, so I'm interested to see what kind of range there is.

New Fictionary for Wind and Truth,"I know it's been awhile without one. But here is the latest Fictionary. I will add some soon for Sanderson's special projects, but wanted to get this one out to you all.

Fictionaries are spoiler free (when possible) ebook dictionaries that define (using Coppermind) the fictional people, places, and things in your book.

Due to changes in Kindle support you must use the side loading method to install your fictionary - meaning a USB cable and preferably software such as Calibre. It is not complicated.

For some unknown reason the Kindle Mobile apps do not support (easily) custom dictionaries. I do provide two formats - kindle, and stardict. The stardict format can be converted to others using different methods found on the Internet.

Does translation from other languages affect fantasy books in a negative way? ,"I’m currently on Time of Contempt in The Witcher saga. I’ve definitely seen some criticisms for certain descriptions and phrasing from Polish to English, but I’m not too sure it bothers me too much. I feel The Witcher books definitely have a certain character and feel to them that is different to most books I have read, but I’m not sure if the translation plays much of a part in that? 

What is your thoughts on translations in fantasy books from other languages? Does it affect the story greatly or do you feel you get the story how it was intended to be told? I’m sure the author is heavily involved with the translation.

A darker shade of magic,"Well, tbh this is a strange post if I may say so myself.

I had started to read the book based on recommendations. Specifically I was looking for a book with things that according to many redditors are included in that book.

I was very excited about it and I started reading the book. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t great either. And while the premise sounded intriguing I had big problem with what I suppose are the main characters. 

To me, there was just no reason to care about them. Not only that but for some reason I can’t stand the tone the author writes in. I’m not sure I’m making myself clear. I don’t mean the tone of the book, as in “serious” or “goofy” or whatever. Rather I’m referring to the “tone of voice” of the author/narrator, for lack of a better description. Everything sounded so smug and complacent…that is the best way I could describe it.

Anyway. It really didn’t help so I just put the book aside. I guess I’d like to ask if any of you felt similarly and if this “tone” changes later?

Thx",fantasy

What I Love About Joe Abercrombie's Writing Is His Cynicism About The Powerful,"I'd say it probably at least borders on nihilism.

Last Stop (The Diamond Knife #1)  by Django Wexler REVIEW,"A new Wexler books. In fact a series.

This is about...bugs. A world where ships sail above the Layer, below live giant bugs. They use the bug blood for fuel, there are cow type bugs that are harvested (flesh is edible also) and nasty attacking type bugs too. They hop in their fighter planes and fight them off...hopefully. As well as pirates.

BLURB:  Zham and his sister, Quedra Sa-Yool, own and run the mercenary airship Last Stop and its motley crew, and Zham leads its tiny air wing. The one thing keeping this ragged outfit - mostly a family but with some new crew -  together (besides Quedra’s blistering stare) is everyone’s desire to survive on the edge, even if that means smuggling, battling pirates, and flying too close to the solid floor of clouds known as the Layer, below which the merciless insectoid mantids hold sway.

Last Stop is enlisted to search for a lost expedition that may have discovered a new haven for humans beneath the Layer.

END BLURB:

The Academics hire them to re-find it and find out what happened. Others try to get the location and some try to kill them. This location is worth monumental fortunes. 

It's pretty much non-stop action from then on. That's it people, spoilers not included. 

It was rather fun. I'll be reading book 2.

The Rings Of Power Show Is Not The Worst Thing Ever. ,"What I mean by this is that the show is not the worst thing to ever happen, let me explain. I am sure like many others I have been keeping a keen eye on the series as many others have too, and I have come to find that the show in the secondary installment has actually improved significantly in all values it has in favor. Now before you go on your own rant I want you to note, no I do not love the adaptation but I do not loathe it either, it is more complicated than that. I will admit upfront, as an avid Tolkien fan I hated the first part of the said show with a burning hate. I did not like the fact that they changed and even dismissed lore and history clearly stated in the time era of the second age they were attempting to portray. And in that rage, I among many others have beat the adaptation into submission with no mercy or eye for the good things within.

It has been a little while since I have gone back to rewatch it to see what casual people might see within it. And I find that the show is not terrible, but it is not exactly wonderful either. I want you to see that the show does have its moments that shine within the muddle. There is some well-written characters and relationship dynamics going on within the runtime. And to be honest, the show has some very beautiful and gorgeous imagery such as the Silver And Gold Trees of Telperion and Laurelin as well as Eregon and Khazad-dûm in its glory days before it fell into darkness and decay. I also think the Music itself it quite a wonderful treat, now do not get me wrong here. I love the "" The Lord of the Rings."" Soundtrack for the Trilogy made by Howard Shore for Peter Jackson's adaptation but I think that Bear McCreary did a wonderous job composing. And I think that to some level the sets and costume design are in their own right, and the orcs look incredible. But with all this said, I think that the worst thing about the show is the characters themselves and the writing.

I am not a fan of how they portrayed Galadriel in the first season, she was hostile, quick to anger, and was rash in her decisions. It was not the Galadriel l I loved and knew, and it surely does not help that many of the characters such as Nori Brandyfoot and Poppy Proudfellow are not very interesting besides the fact that they are nomads among a few other things. The problem was that the characters were no more than just used as plot devices than actual people in the first season. The writing itself was not very organized and it felt like a wild goose chase of a plot and story. Not much really happened in the first season to be very blunt. But in the secondary season that has changed for the better. They are now more interesting and the show has more to offer within the content, it is still very flawed but I would say that I think they have made some noticeable improvements.

This season in all admittance is a lot darker than the last one, it is bold in its new direction. The battles are not glorified but instead made to be brutal in a way that makes your stomach churn with disgust. And the writing is more complex with more things going on, there is more characterization and I think in all honesty Sauron is the most interesting character in the entire show. He is a brooding villain, orchestrating behind their backs. Now I will admit that most of the hintings of who he is go unnoticed by the characters around him and it is obvious to us but not to them for a frustrating plot convenience. But it is redeemed by the fact that he has a sort of disturbing reserved sinister quality about him and his actions before he goes tyrant.

I would even say that I am accepting of the negro characters within the story, in fact, Disa herself is by my own accord is a great character the show offers and the ranger Arondir is a welcome character as of late because of his bravery and loyalty and his own character dynamics. I do note that there is a mix of unnamed characters that are of different races and ethnicities, and in a way I think the showrunners are trying to say that Tolkien is for everyone, that is a wonderful undertone. I think it is brave of them to try and include everyone from everywhere to have us all be a part of it.

I will now say that I still do not appreciate that they tore down the worldbuilding and canon events within the text they are trying to produce, but they have improved in all things. But the secondary season of the series has remedied this in some capacity. They have added Annatar, a canon character along with other people such as the Elven Smith Celebrimbor, The Noble keeper of the Grey Havens Círdan. All in all, I am very much in appreciation of them trying to fix the mistakes that they have made. I would say more but I just don't have the time, but I hope that at least some of you guys would agree with me.",fantasy
Looking for Great Quality Romance,"Hello!

I'm trying to find some romance books that hit the spot where I would read them multiple times.

Good examples of what that is for me is Sunshine by Robin McKinley, and Freedoms Landing series by Anne McCaffrey.

I don't hate smutty parts, but I hate cheap meaningless easy smuttyness as I'm not invested in the characters.

So many romance novels are 'popcorn books' and I want to find some that aren't.

My favorite romance genres are fantasy/sci-fi and paranormal. I really like werewolves, but not really the whole meta situation that is proliferating in the paranormal genre right now.
I also prefer books with a plot outside of the romance that accentuates it.

Any thoughts?

Looking for recommendations with zero to hero MCs that don't get any special super unique bloodline/ability/etc (at least until much later).,"I mostly frequent r/ProgressionFantasy but.. the quality of the stuff that floats around there can be pretty questionable sometimes. My taste in books is obviously no better, seeing as sometimes I like some of those books. My biggest issue is that most of these series end up way too slice of life for my taste, maybe it's common pitfall in amateur writing so it ends up being unavoidable in such a niche genre. 

Either way, title basically explains what I'm looking for. I'll list some of the series I've liked a lot, and a few that I didn't like to avoid having them recommended to me again:

- Red Rising (first trilogy is amazing, fourth book kind of lost me)

- The will of Many (I'm trying to survive until book 2...)

- The Rage of Dragons (amazing, maybe I should pickup book 2..)

- Cradle series (starts off a little boring but ended up becoming one of my top favorites). 

- Shadow slave (this is the one series with questionable writing quality that I enjoy way more than I should.)

- defiance of the fall (maybe the only litrpg I've enjoyed. It's pretty enjoyable for me, but at the same time pretty flawed, but I just skip/skim through those parts). 

- the demon king, seven realms series (one of the few fantasies with romance that I've enjoyed?)

- stormlight archives (pretty good, but started to lose interest with it being less about kaladin leading army trools and becoming more about his individual adventures and fights. Also I hate shallans pov. With a passion. Probably the sole reason I dropped the series. I think it mostly because I listened to audiobook after eye surgery and the voice/narrator made her twice as annoying to me. Was not a huge fan of audio, I'm glad to be back to text reading. Maybe I try this series again? I was on the third book. A little too much pov switching. Would like more kaladin.) 

- art of the adept (pretty solid series, especially at the start. Never read last book cause of negative reviews)

- Tyrsmoon (great first book, kind of falls off, especially at the end)

- Benjamin ashwood (solid series)

- the sword and the staff (decent series)

- codex alera (I did not like most of the pics. Only really enjoyed tavis. I enjoyed this most when he was am upstart commander working his way up the military chain and leading his army against a hopeless situation. Never finished the last book, I just lost too much interest by then.) 

- sword of kaigen (got half way through, was decent but I didn't know what to expect that could keep me interested by that point)

Wouldn't mind something that combines horror or survival elements. Apocalyptic settings are cool too. Romance subplots can be nice too if it isn't stale. Would prefer an MC that doesn't start strong, above most things.

Short horror reads for those who don't want to commit to a long one,"Let's talk short horror! Sometimes we want that chill and thrill without committing to a longer novel. So I've compiled a list of some I love but I'd love to hear yours as well. 

These are perfect for readers who don’t want to commit to a lengthy book of being terrified but want a little kick of fear.  rom stories released over a century ago to those not even out yet, my favorites are all here. 

The Classic One: The Yellow Wallpaper - Charlotte Perkins Gilman 

Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote this short story about the horrors of mental illness and patriarchy way back in 1892 but as a mentally ill woman myself, this one still resonates. There is nothing extreme in this one, no violence, but this will still get under your skin and have you thinking about the main character doing laps round and round the room way after you finish it. 

As an added bonus, because this one came out forever ago you can find this for free in lots of places; on Kindle, on Spotify and you can read it on tons of websites. 

The One I Always Recommend: Starve Acre - Andrew Michael Hurley 

Starve Acre is a folk horror story about a couple who have lost their son, Ewan. Is he still with them? Is the place they’re living cursed? What’s going to happen? At 200 pages, it’s not the shortest of short stories but when you’re used to reading Stephen King for your horror kicks, this is a breeze. And the ending is guaranteed to make you shudder. 

The Short Story Collection: Never Whistle At Night - Edited by Shane Hawk and Theodore C. Van Alst Jr.

This short story collection of indigenous folk horror is fantastic. Every story is by a different author and they vary from body horror to hauntings to gentle horror. Lots of these stories made me think about the origins of horror stories - local lore passed down from generation to generation. The selection of horror authors for this one is impeccable, I particularly love the story Tick Talk by Cherie Dimaline.

The Book Of New Sun Gets weirder but also better with every book.,"Just got done reading **Sword Of The Lictor** and it's my favourite of the 3 books so far &amp; such the first 5 ⭐️ of the 3 yet. I think in this book I have now started to like Severian as a person not just as a character (Person he is rn beyond past transgressions)

This book lacked a major mainstay companion (I mean one that stays so long with him tho maybe little severian could count as that too in a sense) as with the previous 2 &amp; as such no standout new character, well none with much layers as the others but what it lacked here it traded for the most development for Severian so far. He’s a lot more contemplative of not just his own actions and ideals but of the universe itself and the scenarios Wolfe sprawled up for him as adventures or misadventures if you like only served to enhance that even more.

From how he abandoned his Lictor post in Thrax, his farewell to Dorcas to the Alzabo encounter down to little severian’s adoption (his death crushed me, didn't expect it at all and not especially in the manner it happened in tbh) down to the revelations with Typhon, The Hierodules and Baldanders &amp; Dr Talos.

All of these revelations especially with the latter two have retroactively enhanced the whole journey from the first 2 books already &amp; I can only imagine how much more this enhancement will appear with rereads or even after I read Citadel of the Autarch. Sections such as the Eschatology and Genesis play particularly how it ended, the Jolenta dynamic, the Autarchy all have developed deeper layers in light of this book.

I had my suspicions about the dynamics of Dr Talos and Baldanders and even the make up of Baldanders himself seeing as he's essentially a giant but I didn’t at all expect Baldanders was the Doctor here &amp; Dr Talos the Frankenstein monster (I figure that’s what a homunculus is). I appreciate that his abnormal size is explained as proper gigantism syndrome as in the clinical sense.  It's easy to forget this is ultimately sci -fi no matter how alien or fantastical the elements in it appear to be. In light of this, I'm now most curious to see how the claw's apparent time altering powers is explained tbh. This seems too far fetched for simply science but I'll let Wolfe scientifically reveal his world and it's mechanism to me as he's mostly succeeded to do so far.

The deal with the Hierodules I’ve got a reading for but I’m gonna leave it to RAFO in the next book cuz I’m expecting it to come to the forefront there. The Frog boy tale I admit I couldn’t understand much of what occurred during my read much more it’s message but I was informed by rereading Wolfe twitter user that it’s based on The Jungle book and as such I’ll reread that section specifically thought that lens before I start Citadel.

Also during this read I’ve found myself thinking a lot about TBONS beyond the pages and off that alone, it has more than impressed me as only a few media manage to do that for me and not especially when I’m yet to properly place a visage to what the story at hand is.

All in all it’s easily 5 stars and a top 5 reads this year for me and I can’t wait to join the war plot with Severian in Citadel of the Autarch as soon as possible.

  
Edit: Also need to mention the Hethor reveal. Wow just realised the antagonists in this series are really something. ",fantasy
Fantasy where the land/environment is an antagonist?,"I’m curious if anyone has recommendations for fantasy books where the environment is an antagonist and major plot point. Traveling is dangerous, even for experienced travelers.

The main fantasy examples I know are The Hobbit and LOTR. Tolkien went out of his way to say “just traveling is dangerous. Now their rations are getting low, now it’s raining and cold and miserable, now they sheltered somewhere for two weeks to regain strength and morale.” Even just basic things like “Spring was coming on,” or “in Hobbiton they’ll be harvesting right now” gives a sense of connection to the land that I feel missing in modern fantasy.

Other non-fantasy books that give similar vibes are Hatchet and My Side of the Mountain. I don’t need the whole story to be about surviving in the woods, but I’d like some nods to acknowledge that traveling hundreds of miles through wilderness isn’t an “easy” thing that should get hand-waved away. 

Thanks for any suggestions!

*clean* Fantasy series for a 3rd grader?  ,"I’m trying to get my third grader (f) into fantasy books, but I’m having a hard time finding the right ones. A lot of what I've seen so far is either really poorly written, just filled with clichés like unicorns and sparkles (which are great but it can’t solely rely on that), or it’s too mature for her. I’m looking for something that hits that sweet spot in between and that draws her in. 

I want to avoid books that focus too much on romance and definitely steer clear of anything sexual or overly raunchy. A little bit of healthy profanity is okay, though!

Suggestions for Short Stories to Read Aloud,"As the nights grow longer, I'm in search of good fantasy short stories or poems to read aloud to an adult audience. I grew up hearing and reading a lot of Edgar Allan Poe's work performed or read aloud, and now I love to find new stories that are not just good to read, but specifically good to read aloud. For me, this means:

* Not much back-and-forth dialogue
* Between 10-30 minutes to read aloud
* Evocative language that *sounds* good, as Ursula K. Le Guin discusses in her [Writing Lesson](https://lithub.com/a-writing-lesson-from-ursula-k-leguin/)
* Starts and ends with a punch to grab attention and leave listeners with something to ponder
* Strong narrator presence - first person perspective can be helpful

My favorite example I've found in recent years is Ted Chiang's ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate."" Another favorite is Christina Rossetti's poem ""Goblin Market.""

[Review] Knife of Dreams by Robert Jordan,"**Contains mild spoilers for books 1-10 of Wheel of Time**.

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Yet fortunately this time Robert Jordan has got out his wooden boards and shovel and is finally digging the Wheel out of the muddy quagmire that his series has been spinning aimlessly in for the past few books.

**Knife of Dreams** encapsulates all that is good and bad about the Wheel of Time series as a whole. Despite a surprisingly exciting prologue the first half of the book continues to slowly have characters moan and whine about their situation. There are still far too many Aes Sedai with far too many names, and it is nigh on impossible to keep track of all them, let alone remember which ones secretly may or may not be Black Ajah. The Seanchan still feel like an unnecessary side plot that doesn't add much to the overarching narrative, whilst Perrin continues to knot his strip of leather. The one bright spark in all of this is Egwene, who&gt;!after her capture by Elaida's Aes Sedai at the end of the previous book!&lt; is proving very resourceful and continuing her fight in an  unexpected and clever way.

But then we reach the half point of the book and everything kicks up a gear, and reminds you of why you've been reading the Wheel of Time in the first place. There is genuine jeopardy and consequences for the major characters, and the plot actually progresses. Perrin, Elayne and Mat's journeys over the last few books have been resolved in satisfying and exciting ways, and Jordan shows a deft hand and pathos in some instances - &gt;!the understated death of Rolan at the hands of Perrin in Faile's rescue springs to mind!&lt;. It feels like everything is moving forwards again, and as this is the last Wheel of Time book that Jordan fully wrote I am genuinely pleased for him that he could show again what made his work so compelling.

The best compliment I can give this book is that it has made me really excited to read the final few books in the Wheel of Time. It isn't going to win over any naysayers - it is still too long with too many characters who are too often subject to being described with the male gaze. Jordan still has his quirks where he will repeat the same phrase to describe a character over and over again. But it finally starts to pay off all of the setup in previous books and the world is genuinely enormous and well developed, with engaging likeable characters all undergoing their own arcs and slowly building to what I hope will be a well deserved climax at the end.

  
Recommended for:

* Anyone who has got this far in the Wheel of Time so far - the slump seems to have finally ended.
* Possibly no one else? I was very disheartened reading books six through ten as very little happened by way of the plot. I don't think I can recommend such a long series where I've only enjoyed about 60% of it, despite it looking like its picked up again. However, I hope to revisit this and change my mind after reading the last three books!",fantasy
Is Warcraft III still the best story put into a fantasy (strategy) game?,"I replayed Warcraft III recently and it struck me how even after 20 years I'm still yet to play another strategy game that compares in terms of delivering a solid fantasy narrative.

Yes, it's campy and lifts a lot from Forgotten Realms lore, the dialogue is weak and the overall plot is fairly generic, but the pacing is  solid and the key characters journeys (thinking Arthas Menethil, Grommash Hellscream and Illadin Stormrage) are very fun and carry a lot of pathos. Of course, another easy criticism is that those three character arcs deal with the exact same themes but with differing outcomes (i.e. all three are 'corrupted', with Arthas succumbing to the greater evil's manipulation, Grom sacrificing himself to break the blood curse and Illadin being forever tainted and exiled).

More than anything, the pacing and fun characters seem to carry Warcraft III and I can't think of another strategy game (or really other high fantasy game) that has had such an enduring impact.

Looking for highly immersive adult fantasy,"Hello, I hope you’ve all been doing well. 

I’ve been in a rough spot for a while, which I’m sure we’ve all been before, and my situation won’t be changing anytime soon, so…

I’m looking for a highly addictive series or trilogy to distract and pull me in for a while. I enjoy grim fantasy, character driven stories but I don’t enjoy sci- fi elements. I started to read The Black Company by Glen Cook a while ago and I really like it but it’s not quite fast enough to keep me distracted right now. I started Assassins Apprentice by Robin Hobb and was loving it but heard it’s quite sad which I don’t need right now lol.


I’m open to all suggestions, Thank you for any help",fantasy
2024 Bingo: Row One,"**First in a Series:** ***An Absolutely Remarkable Thing*** **by Hank Green**

I fell into a bit of a vlogbrothers hole this year, and decided to give the Science! brother's fiction a shot. Basically, it's an exploration into what being famous in the digital age really means and the different ways in which people collaborate online. The reason our main character becomes famous? She is the first to make a video with Carl, an alien lifeform that suddenly appears in New York. 

It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be (books by Youtubers tend to be...something), but I suppose that makes sense, seeing as Green was writing for his blog long before his fame as a Youtuber. I think the more you are involved in online spaces, the more you will like this book, since it is interested in a lot of the same questions that big media outlets are just now beginning to commonly discuss. 

*Rating: 3.5/5. HM? No. Other Squares: Dreams.* 

**Alliterative Title:** ***Juniper Wiles and the Ghost Girls*** **by Charles de Lint**

Newford is back! I'm so glad that the Mythic Fantasy vs Magical Realism debate for last year's square brought de Lint back into this subs spotlight, because Newford, while uneven, is such a comforting place to visit. The *Juniper Wiles* mini-series follows a young woman who used to be the star of what is very clearly supposed to be a Veronica Mars-type show. She has since come home to Newford and is focusing on learning her art when, out of nowhere, she is contacted by a ghost who cannot tell the difference between her and the fictional character she used to play. 

The two *Juniper Wiles* books aren't as mature or stylish as the main Newford books. Instead, they have sparser prose, move quickly, and have tight plots that feel more comic-booky than the main series. But I'll take anything. Juniper herself is a bit of a mixed bag, and the side plots are a little...very pointed towards current news events...(one, I thought, fit in with the story, one, not so much), but if you like Newford and want a quick read, go for it. It was a good plane-read. If you are wanting to get into Newford, I'd pick someplace else as an entry point. 

*Rating: 3/5. HM? No. Other Squares: Indie Publisher*

**Under the Surface:** ***The Silver Chair*** **by C.S. Lewis**

I've read the beginning and end of *The Silver Chair* before, but never the actual book. Despite loving Narnia as a whole, I keep wandering off before finishing it. This time, I sat down and resolved to read it. 

It wasn't my favorite Narnia book. I wanted Jill to have more ""fun"" while in Narnia. Get to explore, have little side adventures and parties. I also think the pacing was a tad off, and made it a tad difficult to get into. But once I got past re-meeting Caspian, I had a good time. The Giants were fun, the underground...scenes...were interesting and genuinely cinematic, and I want to ride on a giant owl now. I also really liked the vibe between Eustace and Jill. Both were equal parts likable and flawed, and really seemed to be people that just ""get"" each other, without having to be the bestest of best friends, or in a romantic relationship. I also think the detail of what Jill does with her dress after the adventure is fun, and it has stuck with me for years. 

*Rating: 3/5. HM? No. Other Squares: Dreams, Survival.* 

**Criminals: Accursed Son by Eric Avedissan**

I picked this one up at the last sale for self-pubbed books. It's a book about an Armenian man who works in a morgue and can see ghosts. There are biker gangs! There are mobsters! There is family trauma!

I think the beginning of the book is reasonably strong---the dynamics between the family members are immediately evident, and the stressful environment makes it clear why our MC made his first big mistake. The closest thing I can compare it to, in terms of tone, would probably be the *Lucifer* TV show. Doesn't take itself too seriously, except for, justifiably, when the cultural trauma of the Armenian genocide is discussed. It also uses the concept of reanimation (and what bad guys might want it for) in a way, that I can actually say, I've never seen before. 

*HM: No. Other Squares: First in a Series, Eldritch Creatures*

**Dreams: The Master and Margarita by Mikail Bulgakov** 

I'm trying to be more well read, read more classics, etc, so I picked up *The Master and Margarita*. It's a Russian classic about three days where the Devil visited Soviet Moscow. It also, for reasons that become clear later, tell the story of the Pontius Pilate. 

I'm not smart enough to have read this alone; I constantly needed to check online guides to get all the context I was missing to fully ""get"" it. It's also very absurd, which is not something I really enjoy. It's an unmistakably Russian novel, but it also gives Alice in Wonderland vibes. The first sections seemed to be a bit harder to get into, and I'm not sure if I just got used to the writing, or if Bulgakov's race to finish the book before his death caused the last chapters to be more straightforward, but the longer I read it, the more I got into it. And while I didn't always enjoy it while I was reading it, I have found myself thinking about it months later. The Pilate scenes were always fantastic, and the Ball scene was full of interesting easter eggs. 

Manuscripts don't burn!

Recommendation of Read list,"I accidentally found a reviewer on Goodreads who almost matches my taste in books.

Sorting by her 5 stars, there's all my favs. So my question is, how do I - deliberately - find similar reviewers there?  
I tried their own top reviewer list and such like but that doesn't quite work.

Fantasy reviewers, I don't mind some other genres in there (this person has a few) but not loads. I saw another thread listing some, and had a look but the top one mentioned, most were mainstream.

Is it possible? Or just a matter of randomly going through peoples dread lists and seeing?

Why...well I found a few good books off this, that I hadn't read...and now am based on her reviews. So lots more people, lots more books for me..thats the idea anyway.",fantasy

Looking For Completed Series,"Once again - just got into a book to find the seconds not even out. 

I've been just picking things at random lately so thought maybe I'd try to get some actual recommendations.

Completed series would be the main point that drives me bonkers. I binge things all at once or I never get back to them, unfortunately. Trilogies or longer.

I've had a head injury that had made it difficult to read and I'm really trying to get back into it. So major plus if it's well know - higher chance to have a free audio book on my library's app. Listening along as I read really seems to help.

I've been enjoying YA, not sure if it's any easier, faster pacing or just the style of writing. 

I've been reading a lot of romance, but skipping all the smut. Realized it because things can be dark but at least there's generally a positive ending. I read my fantasy to escape from all the terrible things in the world. Give me some joy!

Science Fiction or Fantasy. Rebellions are good, give me someone to root for. Male or Female lead but give me some well rounded women. No Lamps ",fantasy
"Funny, Punny, Godmother, or catch you by surprise series suggestions please","I really enjoyed Piers Anthony's ""Xanth"" series, Robert Aspirin's ""Myth"" series, and Mercedes Lacky (forgive the spelling) Godmother books.

Also enjoyed ""G.O.D. Inc"", forget the author, because it started like a 1950's detective novel and turned into multiple realities (before the multiverse was created by Marvel and DC).

""Well at the End of the World"" series was great too. Sorry it was a long time ago and I've forgotten the author in this one too.

What’s your ideal fantasy home?,"I know we all know the big names, the hobbit hole, a hogwarts dorm, the red keep, (pre)historical places, etc. but given how diverse tastes are in this sub I’d love to know what some of your favorite “fantasy” homes are!

In my opinion, here is the dream home I would love to live in (which the narrator is directed towards me below):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to your dream house on Hațeg Island, a jewel set amidst the subtropical splendor of the Tethys Sea during the Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago (but thousands of years before the infamous extinction event occurred). This narrative will paint a vivid scene of your idyllic sanctuary—a sprawling, eco-friendly mansion fortified with advanced technology, nestled on a shoreline that harks back to the age of the dinosaurs.

#### Architecture and Construction

Your abode is a colossal, cabin-like structure built with reinforced, bullet-proof, and storm-proof materials. Each component—from walls to windows—is meticulously designed to withstand both natural disasters and potential threats from extinct predators like Hatzegopteryx and nefarious human time travelers.

#### Energy and Security

High-efficiency, self-cleaning solar panels adorn the roof, channeling energy into advanced storage systems capable of powering your home through even the longest of storms. Fingerprint recognition technology ensures the front door only opens for you and your family, providing an unassailable fortress of comfort and security.

#### Luxurious Living Spaces

The main structure includes several spacious living rooms, two mildew-proof bathrooms, an attic, a garage, and a state-of-the-art kitchen. Here, any food or drink from modern times is available at your fingertips, imported via advanced cloning technology without any cost.

#### The Underground Paradise

Hidden beneath the surface is a sprawling underground complex the size of New York City, featuring but not limited to:

- **Indoor Playground:** A haven for children and adults alike.

- **Indoor Pool:** Complete with a rock water slide and temperature-regulating heaters.

- **Indoor Hot Tub and Koi Pond:** Both include serene water features and automated maintenance systems.

- **America's Got Talent (Season 1) Stage Replica:** Nearly identical to the original stage to the first America's Got Talent show, but with fog and fire effects, as well as advanced hologram-like technology to portray as contestants and even a judge or 2/3, while also lacking the America's got talent logo and having the third (final) buzzer make a current final buzzer sound effect.

- **Indoor Amusement Park:** Boasting a carousel, ferris wheel, go-karts, bumper cars, miniature roller coaster, log boat ride, and a water park.

- **Animatronic Shows:** Classic Chuck E. Cheese and ShowBiz Pizza Place performances.

- **Game Room:** Equipped with every major gaming console (with free DLCs), arcade games, and two disk-drive-enabled PC laptops.

- **Fitness and Weather Rooms:** Cutting-edge exercise equipment and a safe space to experience various weather conditions.

#### The Duck Pond

A vast, serene duck pond featuring a variety of waterfowl species, both modern and ancient. From the elegant Trumpeter Swans to the larger-than-life Garganornis ballmanni, as well as iconic species like shoebills and flamingos, this pond is an avian Eden equipped with auto-feeders and a luxurious island centerpiece.

#### The Friendly Cleaner

A lab-created, dog-sized rodent roams your home, gobbling up trash and fallen food while efficiently avoiding any bodily waste. This friendly creature keeps your home spotless, a charming alternative to the conventional vacuum cleaner.

#### Modern Conveniences

The mansion includes high-quality air conditioning and indoor heaters, ensuring comfort regardless of the outdoor climate. Infinite high-speed WiFi spanning from 1996 to the present allows you to access and download any content you desire, bridging the gap between time periods.

#### The Miniature Zoo

Within your home lies a mini-zoo containing walkthrough exhibits with diverse species from different periods and regions:

- **Exotic Mammals:** Brazilian tapirs, llamas, sheep, Anatolian shepherd dogs, gray foxes, fennec foxes, wallabies, meerkats, and lemurs.

- **Marine Life:** A large tank for harbor porpoises, harbor seals, and California sea lions, thoughtfully enriched and well-maintained.

- **Birds:** includes but is not limited to various macaws.

- **Ancient Beasts:** Prehistoric animals, including Palaeoloxodon falconeri, Thrinaxodon, Microraptor species, Simosuchus, and a giant Arthropleura armata millipede, genetically modified to thrive in lower oxygen levels.

Each exhibit is meticulously designed with auto-feeders, auto-cleaners, and auto-vets, ensuring the continual welfare and health of every animal. An ingenious animal-creating machine replenishes each species automatically, providing a self-sustaining ecosystem within your dream home.

---

Imagine waking up to the calls of ancient birds and the distant roars of dinosaurs, yet enjoying all modern luxuries. Walking along a shoreline unseen by modern humanity, exploring the breathtaking fauna of Hațeg Island while remaining secure in your impregnable fortress. Your dream home is not just a house; it's a portal through time, a sanctuary blending the wonders of the past with the comforts of the future, making everyday an adventure in paradise.

# [Blackfish City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068768-blackfish-city) by Sam J. Miller

&gt;After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical and social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city’s denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population.  
&gt;  
&gt;When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced. The “orcamancer,” as she’s known, very subtly brings together four people—each living on the periphery—to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.   
&gt;  
&gt;Blackfish City is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection. 

**Note**: type of censorship includes government censorship of historical information. Type of represenation includes multiple queer characters, including non-binary and gay people.

Book Review: Spark of the Everflame (The Kindred Curse Saga #1) by Penn Cole,"**TL;DR Review:** A spitfire of a heroine. A lovely balance between warrior and healer, fighter and caretaker.

https://preview.redd.it/dtpowsyytjtd1.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1e1eeb68c98cfbeb1d3241fca10b87baf6cc26

**Full Review:**

Diem Bellator may be my new favorite badass romantasy heroine!

Let’s get one thing straight: she’s earned every bit of it, with years of training under her mother as a healer, and under her General father in the arts of combat. She knows her way around a scalpel as well as a killing blade, and can tend to wounds as well as she can make them.

But what makes her such a badass is her resilience and strength of spirit.

She has suffered a great deal—as have all the people of her world—under the Descended (essentially, elves/High Fae), doubly so when her mother vanishes and leaves her father to raise her and her younger brother alone. Diem also feels the burden to take her mother’s place as a healer, tending to both the mortals and the Descended (with equal efficiency uninfluenced by personal feelings, as expected from one who’s taken the healer’s oath). But within her is this urge to do more, to push harder, to step out from beneath the shadow of her parents and change—whether herself or the world around her, she doesn’t know yet.

And most of all, she feels compelled to ***FIGHT***. To fight against the injustices of her world. To fight against the oppression of the Descended and the horrific rule that any half-mortal, half-Descended must be murdered. To fight against the King’s stringent laws that allow the Descended to get away with doing whatever they want. To fight against anyone who would try to get her to sit down and shut up because that is not who she was raised to be.

She is a spitfire in every way—and an absolute joy to read because of it—but she’s also as flawed and realistic as you could wish for in a heroine/protagonist. She struggles, suffers, cries, fears, and worries like the rest of us, and that makes her a fully *human* character you absolutely want to read more about. Her journey is filled with unexpected twists and surprises, but she faces each with that strength of spirit that makes her such a compelling character.

The plot of this book is a lot of fun: her work as a healer brings her to the Palace, where she’s drawn into the path—and charm—of the dark, brooding Prince Luther, but also makes her ideal to help the humans who are working against the Descended in their efforts to bring down or strike back at the powerful overlords. There’s mystery, tension, reveals, heartbreak, loss, and happiness—plus, the beginnings of a deliciously slow-burn romance.

But what makes *Spark of the Everflame* so great is the fire that burns inside Diem and keeps her pushing toward making the right choice, even when she doesn’t know what that is—or worse, when she knows it may cost her dearly. The balance between healer and warrior is done beautifully and makes for a really engaging character I can’t wait to follow into more adventures in the rest of this series.",fantasy
"I'm Karin Lowachee, author of the newly released (as of today in N. Am!) novella THE MOUNTAIN CROWN from Solaris Books. AMA.","[Out today in North America!](https://preview.redd.it/5q9qo13l7jtd1.jpg?width=249&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50501a52c10c575ab37321a0cf2fe01962da8d94)

Hello r/Fantasy! I'm Karin Lowachee, Canadian author of [THE MOUNTAIN CROWN](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Mountain-Crown/Karin-Lowachee/The-Crowns-of-Ishia/9781837862399), the first in a trilogy of novellas entitled **The Crowns of Ishia**. It's a literary frontier fantasy -- with dragons! Featuring a stalwart FMC named Méka, a one-handed war veteran named Lilley, and a powerful but troubled traitor named Raka. The three find themselves together on a mission to ""gather"" a king dragon in the Crown Mountains, and that's where the problems begin. Part of the kernel of this idea was born when I asked myself, *What if dragons were an essential part of the world's ecosystem? How would a people control the population of these apex predators? What would that relationship look like? And what would happen if such a relationship was threatened by war?*

I've been a published writer since my debut novel *Warchild* in 2002, the first in a military science fiction mosaic written more like memoirs. I'm interested in exploring the psychologies of my characters, especially when they aren't easy to define or comfortably palatable (as people don't tend to be). I've also written numerous short stories of various genres, dabbled in poetry, and I'm a regular film/TV columnist for *The* *Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction*.

Occasionally I've taught writing both online and in person, so be welcome to ask any craft questions! Some of my all-time favourite novels are: *Blood Meridian* by Cormac McCarthy, *Days Without End* by Sebastian Barry, *The Outsiders* by S.E. Hinton, *Drive* by James Sallis, and *Cyteen* by CJ Cherryh.

When I'm not writing, I'm a butler to a black cat. You can find me online at [karinlowachee.com](http://karinlowachee.com), and **I'll be giving away 5 e-copies of** ***THE MOUNTAIN CROWN*** in a random draw of those participating in the AMA today.

Big List: r/Fantasy's Top Self-Published Novels Voting Thread,"https://preview.redd.it/lu86j0v0rrsd1.jpg?width=1550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcfe6ce70c2252494a6d5eaa0ea706360dd5c0ed

**It's time for another**  **Big List!** This time we are doing our favorite self-published novels. All speculative fiction qualifies (fantasy, science fiction, horror, magical realism, and more).

The results from last year's poll can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17enqms/big_list_rfantasys_top_selfpublished_novels_poll/)**.**

**Tl:dr:** post your ten favorite self-published novels/series. Top-level comments are for the votes only, with discussion happening in the replies.

# The rules are simple:

1. Make a list of **up to TEN** of your favorite self-published novels in a new comment in this thread. Don't overthink it, it's not about finding books that are objectively the best, just your favorite ones. You can change votes / your list as often as you like during the voting week. I'll start counting votes after the voting closes (October 21).
2. **Only books that are currently self-published count for this poll.** Self-published books picked by publishers are no longer eligible. We will also be ignoring hybrid series, like those by Michael J. Sullivan, T. Kingfisher, and Lois McMaster Bujold, where they're partially self-published and partially traditionally published. This concerns also Dungeon Crawler Carl since Ace picked print-only rights for it.
3. Only one vote per series: you can vote on multiple books by your favorite author, **BUT** **everything from the same series will be counted as one vote for that series.**
4. **Format your vote correctly -** The votes will be tallied with a script, so proper formatting is especially important to ensure it all goes smoothly. **Incorrectly formatted votes** **will not count**. I am going to be lenient with warnings and will help you fix it, but ultimately your vote is your responsibility.
5. I didn't expect to have to write this, but I need to: **you can't vote for the book you wrote yourself.** This isn't a self-promo post. I understand that many of you are proud of your works (as you should be), but in my opinion, mentioning them in your list of top favorite novels goes against the spirit of this list.
6. Another new rule - I won't count votes by new accounts with zero history that happen to vote for one book only. Sorry.

# To format correctly:

* **Put each vote on a new line.** To do so, keep a blank line between every vote OR put two spaces before pressing enter. Making it a bullet-point list is fine.
* **Format your vote as Title - Author.** If unsure, please look at how most do it. Italics or bold should be perfectly fine. Common mistakes are putting the author first, listing just the book name, and omitting the ""-"" or separator...please do not do that, or your vote will not be counted.
* **Please leave all comments and discussions for the discussion posts under each original post.** In your voting comment, just list your top ten. This thread has the potential to be huge, and it'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. However, you can reply to voting comments with all the arguments and discussion you want!

# Voting info

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that book. **Upvotes and downvotes will not affect the final result.**

The voting will run for approximately one week and voting will close on October 12.

**Vote, discuss, and find new things to read.**

Empire of Silence Tedious,"Can someone convince me to keep going with this series? I’m about 150 pages in and it is just so tedious. I normally like slow pacing (Hobb, WOT, Name of the Wind), etc…) But this is something different entirely.

Maybe it’s something unique to sci-fi, as I mostly read fantasy, but there is so much rambling about philosophy, more than actual plot at times. Sometimes it can be profound, but at others it is so heavy handed and often that it feels rather pretentious… Also, usually the strength of 1st person POV is that it allows a reader to really connect with characters, being so close to them, but I find myself not really caring about anyone. (It’s written in kind of a detached way)

Does this book get better with these issues? And is it worth persevering?",fantasy

Broken Binding Press signs book deal with Ryan Cahill's The Bound and The Broken series,"From his news letter: 

&gt; It's pretty rare that I send out more than one email in a month. But I did tell you this was coming... and it's a pretty important email because the Day of the Dragon 2024 is finally upon us!
&gt; 
&gt; Before I jump into the answering the burning question that I'm sure plenty of you have (What in the gods is the Day of the Dragon really?) I just had two things I wanted to say.
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing is that I wanted to say thank you to everyone who reached out and sent an email in reply to my last newsletter. You guys genuinely fucking rock. I can very happily say, with my hand on my heart, that I have the best readers in the world. I haven't had the chance to respond to the emails yet – what's new? – but I wanted you to know that I've read them, and that I appreciate them!
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing I wanted to talk about is a pretty big thing. In fact, it's the single biggest thing that has happened in my author career, and the biggest thing that's happened to The Bound and The Broken since the launch of Of Blood and Fire back in March 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; The worldwide english language print rights to The Bound and The Broken have just been acquired in a major six-figure deal. This is something that I could never even have dreamed of when I started this journey back in 2021. And I'm still a little bit in awe that it's even happened.
&gt; 
&gt; What does this actually mean?
&gt; 
&gt; The print rights to the series have been sold – but no other rights. So I will still retain ebooks and audio rights, along with everything else. But The Broken Binding Press have acquired worldwide english language print rights (Hardbacks and Paperbacks).
&gt; 
&gt; Each of the books will be getting brand new (absolutely, stunningly beautiful) covers by the incredible Tom Roberts, who has designed Godkiller by Hannah Kaner, and The Book that Wouldn't Burn by Mark Lawrence. I lead the art direction on the new covers and what I can tell you right now is they are tear-jerkingly beautiful. 
&gt; 
&gt; This means that the hardbacks and paperbacks will be readily available all across the world, and at a much better price (due to being able to print thousands at a time). Availability has always been an issue with the physical books – not any more!
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to dominate this email with this (even though I'm beyond excited), so here are just a few quick answers to questions I know you'll have:
&gt; 
&gt; The new Trad Published edition for Of Blood and Fire is slated for 02 September 2025, but that date might shift a little.
&gt; Of Empires and Dust will be published like normal in a few months and the new covers will transition over later.
&gt; The fifth book and fourth novella in the series will be published in the new editions and the self-published editions at the same time. My new print publisher has agreed to do this because they are amazing people and we both want to make sure that my readers who have been supporting me all along can still getting a full matching set of all the books in their original cover style. Don't worry, I got you.
&gt; There is a bit more in the article linked above, and I will do a whole section on this in my newsletter at the end of the month but I just wanted to make sure you heard the massive news directly from me!
&gt; 
&gt; You are the reason this has happened. Your support, your passion, your kindness, and your genorisity in the time that you have given to my books. Every friend you have told, every reader you've encouraged, every page you've turned. And I will never forget it.

There is also an article, but its behind a soft paywall: 

https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/the-broken-binding-press-signs-epic-fantasy-series-from-phenomenon-ryan-cahill

Really exciting to see how far both Ryan and Broken Binding has been growing. And man am I happy to see that they will finish off the series with the original indie covers so people don't have to have missmatched sets. 

There is also a bunch of indie books on sale (including Cahill's) on Kindle today. I will work on adding links to this post as I round them up.

Is there a fantasy series with goblins like in Warcraft? ,"I really love the unique way goblins are designed in World of Warcraft. Tiny, green and vicious as always but far from dumb savages. Goblins have a high IQ and an innate talent for technology and are able to build amazing contraptions that are often comically unreliable and prone to exploding.

They are also inherently greedy and will one way or another be compelled to use their talents to amass wealth becoming thieves, mercenaries or merchants selling all kinds of crazy inventions to the highest bidder.

Is there a fantasy series with similar goblins or another race that matches these traits?",fantasy

Review: Dodger by Terry Pratchett,"**Didn't live up to its potential**

Terry Pratchett is of course highly regarded for his Discworld series. The one or two of these that I tried didn't captivate me, so I figured that the stand-alone novel ""Dodger"" might be a better place to get introduced to Pratchett's work, given that this book has received decent ratings.

The story is set in Victorian London, and the premise is somewhat inspired by the Artful Dodger character from Charles Dickens. Our protagonist and hero is a 17 year old whom we know only as ""Dodger"". He's a ""tosher"", which means that he earns a livelihood scavenging sewers for coins and other valuables that have been washed down city drains.

After stepping in to rescue a young lady who was being assaulted, Dodger's fortunes begin to change significantly for the better. His hero status is further enhanced after he disarms the murderous barber Sweeney Todd. Soon he finds himself wearing fine clothes and mingling with the upper crusts of society. But can he save the mysterious lady he's rescued from the villains who want to bring her back to her abusive husband in another country? Dodger's clever plan to accomplish this rounds out the novel in a satisfying way.

The Victorian setting is both a strength and a weakness. Along the way Dodger gets introduced to figures of history that Pratchett has incorporated into his story, such as writer Charles Dickens, philanthropists Angela Burdett-Coutts and Henry Mayhew, politician Benjamin Disraeli, head of police Robert Peel, illustrator John Tenniel, and even the queen. I enjoyed learning about these historical personages, and even found myself heading to Wikipedia more than once to find out more about them. Pratchett also does a good job of evoking the setting of the time. The underground parts of the story in the sewer were especially interesting.

But there's also a downside to this historical setting. There's a lot of terminology from the period that isn't easy to understand, and this unnecessarily puts heavier demands on the reader. The book really needs an accompanying glossary of terms.

Besides the language, Pratchett's style also takes some getting used to. He can be witty and funny at times, and there are aspects of dry humour throughout. But it's not the kind of thing you can quickly skim read, because you risk missing a lot. Careful attention is needed to the details, and for me this made the story feel like harder work than an average book. However, this more likely reflects negatively on me as a reader rather than on Pratchett as a writer.

Those are minor criticisms, and I can easily overlook them. But for me what I especially had trouble with was the many instances of irreverence towards religion, particularly how it is voiced by Dodger's jeweller landlord Solomon Cohen. There's no profanity, but there are also numerous instances of crudeness, although that's to be expected given that a big part of the story has us follow a guy walking in the muck of sewers, and I can live with that.

I'd be interested to hear from readers more familiar with Pratchett's work whether characters irreverent to God or religion are a common feature in his Disc World, or whether what I encountered in ""Dodger"" is an exception for him.",fantasy
Books where the fmc is the boogeyman,"Hey all! Kinda specific request here, but I’m looking for books where the fmc is very strong, but the story focuses on something else than her finding and developing her powers. Bonus points if she’s older than 25.

If you are undecided about what to select for a square this year, then there might be something here of interest to you.

No duds this time, and two meh's. It's distinctly possible I would have rated those books differently if I'd read them when I was in a different mood.

There were 11 authors that I hadn't read before (at least at novel length).

I started 7 new series and continued 8 more.

My favorite Bingo read on this card was *Red Side Story*.

My least favourite was *Grunts!*.

The square I was most looking forward to was the Space Opera one. The square I was not looking forward to was Bards.",fantasy

I cringed at every Shallan chapter. I started to like her toward the end of Words of Radiance. Now, I’m a third of the way through Oathbringer, and I’ll be damned if I don’t actually thoroughly enjoy reading the Shallan chapters.

I’m not sure if this was a deliberate attempt by Sando to make her more likable, or if the character just grew on me. Either way, I’d be interested to know if other people had a similar change of opinion.",fantasy
Biggest jump in quality between books?,"Just wondering what you guys think was the biggest jump in quality between books by an author.

I've also heard that the Sun Eater series gets so much better which makes me really excited as I am thoroughly enjoying the first book right now.",fantasy

I was shocked that I haven't been able to find books or anything with a similar concept. i swear i read a short story somewhere that had a similar idea but i havent been able to find it again...does anyone know of any books (or short stories) that include a society or people that live inside a giant creature like this? doesnt have to be a space whale, though that would be an excellent bonus",fantasy
"Extroverted Lead Characters, where they at?","On one hand I get it, I'm probably not the primary market for Fantasy Novels. My kind have been known to scorn the page for the party while the *real* target audience hide away from the likes of my energy-vampirism. Using the very fantasy novel I wish I could relate to more.

Truth is, I struggle to vibe with the protags who keep going off by themselves to train/study/work and make everyone wonder where they've been (\*coughvothe\*), the brilliant social outcasts who excel at their craft but never show any prowess or results in conquering the social scene.

I can't be the only one (that's the extrovert catch phrase). Maybe I just haven't found the right books. So true to form, I thought I'd engage the masses: do you know any fantasy books with extroverted leads? Real 'people people' with high charisma whose talents include getting (the love interest) everyone on their side, and whose insufficiencies lie elsewhere? Main Characters who feel at home and at rest in large social gatherings and yet struggle with the isolation of exploring the wilderness etc etc. Nothing against introverts at all. I enjoy the perspective. I admire your productivity in isolation. I'd just like to relate more to my MCs for a change.

Or maybe there's a real lack of representation. Perhaps the profession of writing just necessitates conditions where introversion thrives and I promise this paragraph is totally not just here to provide extra discussion opportunity so this post doesn't get condemned to the Daily Simple Questions &amp; Recommendations thread.

So extroverted MCs, can ya'll recommend me books with them in it?

Much love!",fantasy
The Sapling Cage review (for my ‘Published in 2024’ Bingo Card),"After feeling very out of the loop for the last few years on most of the books that got nominated for awards, I have decided that 2024 is my year of reading stuff being currently published.  While I will no doubt get sidetracked by shiny baubles from the past, I am going to be completing a bingo card with books solely written in 2024. 

I’ve been on the lookout for epic fantasy debuts, especially since I wasn’t terribly impressed with the early few I read for this card.  While The Storm Beneath the World was phenomenal, Sapling Cage had already captured my attention and interest.  Epic Fantasy through the lens of witchcraft sounds fascinating

*This book is good for readers* *who like* Witches, Tamora Pierce, LGBTQ+ rep (trans &amp; asexual primarily), books that wind instead of twist.

https://preview.redd.it/mlk0nx4w6utd1.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c331212da5abd53f0a4b8f29645a9f96cf773d

**Elevator Pitch**:  Lorel wants desperately to be a witch, and trades places with her best friend to do so.  The only problem, Lorel was born in the body of a boy, and witches only let women in.  It doesn’t matter that Lorel thinks of herself as a woman, so she must hide that part of herself.  She joins the witches at a turbulent time.  Duchess Helte is on the move to grab power, demonizing the witches as a scapegoat.  The Knights are more violent than normal, and someone has developed a magic that Blights the land, and nobody knows who or how.  Lorel just wants to learn magic, but its a long and winding road to get there.

**What Worked for Me** I really, really jived with this book.  It felt exactly like what an epic fantasy book focused on witches would be like.  It’s less focused on epic battles or grand gestures and more on the process.  For all its about witches, relatively little magic is actually done in this book, and Lorel learns almost none of it in book 1.   Witches treat words and weapons with equal value as magic, and the cycle of life, of the seasons, and of relationships (mostly platonic) are central to the storyline.  I think some would claim this isn’t epic fnatasy.  The stakes are closer to Game of Thrones than Stormlight, for example, but I think it fits quite nicely.

One thing I appreciated was how the book was plotted.  The author eschewed a lot of the more traditional storytelling beats, oftentimes establishing and resolving elements in quick succession, but in a way that felt more natural to how things actually happen, rather than how stories are supposed to go.  Similarly, the interactions between characters feel refreshingly natural.  The people are just … people.  They’re allowed to exist in a way that even the best character writers like Hobb sometimes lose in their deep pursuit of developing characters.  Killjoy just lets them exist as they were, following them in a way that feels natural.

This book is brutal, but not in a way designed to tug heartstrings.  It’s brutal because life is.  People die.  The main character questions lots of things.  The adults aren’t total idiots and similarly the whelps (below even apprentice witches) get things wrong.  It was all just refreshing in how understated the book was.  Lorel’s journey on her identity, on navigating whether or not she even wants a physical transition, is similarly low drama, despite the intolerance she faces from some.

I’ve said it a few times already, but this feels like a really pure distilattion of epic fantasy + witches, and if that idea appeals to you at all, then this is a good one.

**What Didn’t Work for Me** The worldbuilding was a hair simple for me.  For how natural everything else felt, the clear ‘factions’ of witches, knights, and brigands, each oddly symmetrical, felt a bit out of place and forced in a way the rest of the book wasn’t.  It didn’t pose a huge barrier to entry, but was definitely something I was noticing while reading.  It isn’t quite as clear cut as witches = good and knights = bad (there are plenty of helpful knights and nasty witches) but I think introducing those dynamics in a less formalized way would have been good for the book.

For all that I liked how subtle the story was, I do think it lacked just a little bit for an ‘it factor’.  This book was enjoyable in almost every single way, and you can bet I’m reading the sequel when it drops, but there was a little nibbling feeling like something was missing.  Can’t tell you what it is though.

**TL:DR** Epic Fantasy with witchcraft at the core.  If that idea is intriguing, this book is for you.

Book or Series Recommendations - I've read most mainstream fantasy,"TLDR: **What I'm looking for**:  I’d be looking for something like *Kingkiller*. I don’t need GRRM or Rothfuss level writing, but I’d hope for good writing, good (or great!) characters, and a good story. Preferably with magic and swords, but I'm fine with urban fantasy or steampunk. I'd prefer cleaner books, if possible. I also prefer avoiding grimdark. And if there's a books-long need to get a payoff, I'm not interested. If there's a significant drop in quality of the books, please note that and whether it's worth just reading the first few books.

+++++

Longer post:

I've read most mainstream fantasy - Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, Dark Tower, First Law, R. Scott Bakker, His Dark Materials, Kingkiller. Gentleman Bastards, Stormlight (first two), Earthsea, Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams. I’ve tried Realm of the Elderlings, Malazan, Riftwar, and Mistborn. There may be more and I'll try to update this if I forget a major omission.

Recent series' that I've read, and really enjoyed, were:

1. *The Books of Babel* by Josiah Bancroft. These were amazing, and unusual - never quite read anything like it (I admittedly skipped the last book based on a friend's recommendation);
2. *The Fire Sacraments* by Robert VS Redick. Probably my favorite series I've picked up since *Kingkiller*. It's not finished, but Redick is working on it and his publication dates have been 2018 and 2021 (*Sidewinders*).
3. *Scholomance* by Naomi Novik. Also very good, Novik's characterization of El are super impressive and her writing is very polished.

I've tried reading a number of major recommendations. Forgive me if I'm being rude, but I did not enjoy John Gwynne or Riyria. I tried the Bound and the Broken. I don't want to rip on more books, but I'm just trying to tackle common recommendations. I found the characters and writing in these . . . lacklustre.

If it helps, personal favorites are WoT, ASoIaF, and Kingkiller.

**What I'm looking for**:  I’d be looking for something like *Kingkiller*. I don’t need GRRM or Rothfuss level writing, but I’d hope for good writing, good (or great!) characters, and a good story. Preferably magic, swords, but I'm fine with urban fantasy or steampunk. I'd prefer cleaner books, if possible.

**I prefer avoiding**: grimdark. And if there's a books-long need to get a payoff, no thanks. If there's a significant drop in quality of the books as the series progresses, please note.

I have Janny Wurts and the Coldfire Trilogy on my ""to read"" list, as an FYI.

"The Facefakers Game, Chandler Birch","How did I miss this book for so long?

Loved it!! For fans of Rothfuss it says...I'd agree with that.

I liked the magic, the faces...

From Ashes (the orphan street urchin) to Mr. Ragged (the evil crime lord) and Candlestick Jack (the crafty master thief) sounds like people you know from other books but they have their own personality and talents.

I loved Ashes.

And this is a first book, wow, I say, I'll be watching this author for more, without question.

Some things aren't explained - yet - rasas, ravagers...so I am hoping this means more. Yay!!!

I think people don't know David Gemmell enough.,"Well, about almost 20 years ago i was introduced by my brother to David Gemmell, a writer, and he lend me then ""The sword of Night and Day"" and ""White Wolf"". I was mesmerized by it, i ate all words, finished both in a few days. Loved it. After those, i bought my own and some more. Hehe. :)

Years gone by and every time i talked about Gemmell or his work to all of my friends that read that kind of extraordinary/fantasy writing, they just didn't know about it! Some time ago i lend to a friend just the same books as my brother, and he absolutely loved it too! And was a lil bit disappointed on not knowing Gemmell or the Drenai Saga ( the writer has others sagas).

My question here is:

Do you guys know Gemmell and his wonderful work? If yes, tell me about it. If not, here's a recommendation! 😁😄

The beauty of The Gentlemen Bastards by Scott Lynch,"I need to confess - this series was in my TBR list for a long time. Like, really long. I guess it was 10 years or so and i always had a reason to not read it - i was afraid that it will turn to another ASOIAF or Kingkiller Chronicles, i had something more interesting to read or i just had something more important to do. But finally, in 2024 it happen. I've read it.

So what Gentlemen Bastards series actually is? It's a great story about certain characters (what a description!).

What i found good about the story - it always keeps you on the hook, so you have no choice but to rush forward to know what happens next. And it starts right from the beginning when Thiefmaker tries to sell the MC with words ""He's a good material, but i'm selling him cheap cause if i wouldn't do it, i'll need to slit his throat"". And you hooked right from the beginning to know why. This approach works fine almost all time (except second book) and despite the significant size of these books i've read them pretty much fast.

Characters are also make great impression - Locke became one of my most favorite fantasy characters, for example. Because he is pretty much complicated person - from one side he can punch old lady into the face and shamelessly deceive the most saint persons, but at the same time he could kill for his family and keep himself for the one and only woman. It's really exciting to watch him and discover new layers in his personality. And it's only the MC - we provided with pretty much interesting set of characters.

The world is not the most unique - you should't be the history professor to tell that the world around heavily reminds of Italian Medieval City states, especially Camorr which is fantasy analogue of Venice. But at the same time here is magic, relics of old, forgotten civilization and a lot of new rules and customs, unique to this particular world. So as fantasy reader you shouldn't be disappointed here.

The Lies of Locke Lamora is a great beginning and at the same time the most dramatic and the best book in the series. History jumps between present and past, telling us at the same time the main story and the story of Gentlemen Bastards creation. It has all good stuff i mentioned before and is the most iconic book on the series. Also, for those who prefers reading standalones it's also a good choice, because story is pretty much self-contained, unlike next books.

I need to mention that i saw many times on Reddit how some people complaining like ""I've read 80-100 pages and there is nothing happens. Would it be better later?"". I don't know honestly, because in my opinion there's a lot of things happened, but also a lot of premise and character building. And without it, drama near the end just wouldn't work. And just to warn - books focusing a lot on the characters development, not to the extent of Realm of Elderlings, but significantly.

Also i saw weird critique that it's hard to follow the story because of flashbacks. Common, guys, it's not that hard, really. Main story and a bunch of important flashbacks put into chronological order. It's not the hardest story to follow.

Read Seas Under Red Skies is imo the weakest part of series. Don't get me wrong, it's still good and i liked it, but imo it tries to contain too much. It starts as Ocean's Eleven, turning into Pirates of Caribbean and them jumps back. And it is exactly the moment when flashbacks became a bit confusing because they not always linked to the events, happening now. But, again, it is still good book.

The Republic of Thieves has the one and only thing all Gentlemen Bastards fans wanted to see for a long time. Sabetha. Finally, out MC got his wifu back and we also can see the character, which was so much foreshadowed, but wasn't shown even a bit previously. Story again goes back and forth showing two storylines both related to MCs romantic relationship. It's pretty engaging, but need to say that story from the past was much more interesting and the actual story was more like a background for Locke-Sabetha story and also was a pre-history and cliffhanger for the next book.

I think it's a great series, which due to latest news finally will be continued, so don't afraid to jump into. ",fantasy
*clean* Fantasy series for a 3rd grader?  ,"I’m trying to get my third grader (f) into fantasy books, but I’m having a hard time finding the right ones. A lot of what I've seen so far is either really poorly written, just filled with clichés like unicorns and sparkles (which are great but it can’t solely rely on that), or it’s too mature for her. I’m looking for something that hits that sweet spot in between and that draws her in. 

I want to avoid books that focus too much on romance and definitely steer clear of anything sexual or overly raunchy. A little bit of healthy profanity is okay, though! What I really want are stories that are epic, full of adventure, bravery, high stakes, friendship, and resilience written at the 3rd grade level. 

I’ve found some series by Ted Dekker with mixed reviews and I’m wondering if there are others.

Edit: Holy 😅 there are so many suggestions, how magnificent! I see a lot of repeats so I’ll 
most likely be researching those first, then branching out towards the others. Im truly curious to find some of these and give them a chance.

Dragon Book Comparison,"I love dragons. A lot. Maybe not fanatically, but enough where I plan to get a full back tat of a bunch of different types.

That being said, I'm always in the lookout for books with dragons being central to the plot. Recently, I read through *Fourth Wing* not knowing the critical vs. public reception. I was surprised to find more critical readers weren't a fan. I loved it for how easy a read it was. Plus the dragons were pretty neat. I had conflicting feelings about the way the MCs medical condition was employed but as I'm going through some similar disabling fatigue, I appreciated it for its intention to an extent.

Fast forward a few months and I picked up a book from The Last Word Bookshop in West Philly. (I mention in case any Philly people here want a lovely bookstore experience. Floor to ceiling, wall to wall books. It's magical.)

The book is *Battle Dragons: City of Thieves* by Alex London. First off, the cover is cool af. Second, it's a Scholastic book, so the nostalgia hit for book fairs. Then once I get into it, it's well written such that myself (FTM/NB 28) or a person with at least a 3rd/4th grade reading level would be able to follow well. Beyond the writing style being fun and fluent, the content is great in comparison to FW; the main character is implied to have ADHD (relatable), the main side character is non-binary (relatable), and to top it off, there's lovely reflections about growing up (too soon maybe as the MC is 12).

I'm a third close to halfway through the book but I'm really stunned by the quality difference and impression this book is already leaving on me.

I just wanted to share and maybe encourage people to check out works written for younger audiences. There's apparently some cool af stuff at there I otherwise would not have considered before now.",fantasy

Filthy fantasy?,"So, I've seen quite a few posts lately that are looking for clean fantasy and I'm not trying to judge them, people want what they want, but it's got me thinking, am I reading the wrong books? I say this, because I'm actually strugling to remember the last fantasy novel I read that was even a little dirty. And then I started thinking about what might exist if we went the other way? So I put it to the discerning gentle-ladies, gentlemen and gentle-persons of R/Fantasy what can we find if we want that dirt? I don't care about sub-genre, genre, orientation, or gender of the MC, just that it's not afraid to spend the same kind of attention on eroticism that some other authors spend on, lets say, other types of action.

Look for recommendations - fantasy novels (or other media) related to fables. ,"Hello, everybody. 

Recently, I've been playing this video game called Lies of P - a grim story loosely based on Pinocchio. And it reminded me of some short stories by Gaiman that took place in the world of fables. A detective trying to solve a murder case. 

So I was wondering if anyone here maybe have some more examples of such approach toward classic children stories and fables? The idea is quite appealing to me, I have to admit.

"War for the Oaks, by Emma Bull (Bingo review 17/25)","One of the bingo squares is ""bards,"" which includes musicians, poets, storytellers, etc. I saw this book recced for that square because it's about a rock-and-roll singer in 1980s Minneapolis; I was intrigued because I grew up outside the Twin Cities and had never heard of it, and wasn't running across anything else that would fit for the square, so sought it out.

Does it deliver on the local flavor? Yes, it does! This setting is a little before my time, but if names like Byerly's, Dayton's, Nicollet Mall, First Avenue, City Pages, the Metrodome (""not bad...for a glow-in-the-dark fungus""), and, of course, Prince mean anything to you, you'll appreciate it.

Okay, so what about everything else?

In ""Neverwhere,"" Richard Mayhew shows compassion to a homeless person, and that's the kiss of death--he gets dragged into an urban fantasy with a bunch of quipsters, and can't go back to his normal life no matter how hard he tries. Here, Eddi McCandry doesn't even have an inciting incident to blame; she gets forcibly dragged into a faerie war because she has...the power of rock and roll?...and spends the rest of the book with a shapeshifting dog ""phouka"" keeping watch, being an insufferable quipster, calling her pet names every other sentence, and generally being annoying until it turns into Stockholm syndrome.

The contrived premise is that the Seelie Court (monarchist fae) are at war with the Unseelie (commoners?) but both sides are by default immortal; in order for their wars to have real stakes and for people to die, they have to have a mortal human in their midst. Eddi points out, very reasonably and frequently, that she didn't ask for this and there are lots of humans they could pick on, but oh well, she's stuck with it.

One of the things the book does well is that, when Eddi's bandmates are reasonably skeptical of the supernatural goings-on, the phouka reluctantly decides ""okay, you're part of this too"" and demonstrates his shapeshifting abilities. Music is a group activity; it's not just for the chosen one.

Eddi's friend Carla, the percussionist, is very Minnesotan; she says things like ""you betcha"" and ""come with."" Also, she recognizes the word ""phouka"" because it was used in an [old movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(1950_film))--this is the same place where Harvey from Farscape got his name! (And in both cases, it's like, I can sort of see how a 1950 movie might still have barely been a cultural allusion for the target audience, but it's very much not for me.)

There's a running theme of ""women have to be assertive to make it in the rock world; there's no shortage of self-centered male musicians who will try to flirt with you, and if you're strong enough to stand up to them, a faerie queen is nothing."" And some of the foreshadowing will be familiar if you're genre-savvy, although I formed the wrong impression early on about ""hmm, is this character actually the bad guys also trying to get to Eddi.""

The fae have questions like: ""Do your people ever write songs about anything besides love and death?"" This could have gone in a more heavy-handed direction, like, ""only the humans have good art because they appreciate the Transience of Life, us immortals don't really get it,"" which would have been annoying, so I'm glad they didn't. On the other hand, as someone who gets easily sick of those genres, I would have liked to hear more, weirder, faerie music.

The Seelie are set in their ways because they're 1. immortal and 2. monarchists, but the Unseelie are worse because...they're evil???

&gt;""It's not just for you, it's for the entire seven-county metro area. Couldn't we just let them have St. Paul?""  
...  
""This city is alive with the best magic of mortal folk. The very light off the skyscrapers and the lakes vibrates with it. If the Unseelie Court takes up residence here, this will be a place where people fear their neighbors, where life drains the living until art and wit are luxuries, where any pleasant thing must be imported and soon loses its savor.""

I think Bull would agree that for her, Minneapolis is a magical place because she loves it; for someone else, any city could be that place, but they also have the potential to be lifeless, unmagical places.

At the end of the 2001 edition, there's an appendix--a note saying that the author and her husband have since adapted it to a screenplay, including a few scenes that aren't in the novel. This allows for POV characters, and corresponding settings, besides Eddi: her loser ex-boyfriend gets more of a character arc, and long-lost nightclubs in the [caves above the Mississippi River](https://www2.startribune.com/st-paul-caves-history-sandstone-west-side-mushroom-valley-mississippi-river/600059769/) make an appearance. I think this could be a change for the better (there were a lot of descriptions of clothing that weren't super engaging to me), but also, you do know books are allowed to have more than one POV character, right?

When Eddi and her friends are at a Midsummer gathering with the faeries, one of the songs they play is ""[Safety Dance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Safety_Dance)"" I can't tell if that was as silly/memetic in 1987 as it lands today. Either way, I think it's a useful warning that ""giving shoutouts to the musicians you like"" can't be your only reason for a creative project. And, like musical tastes, some of the ""my primrose""/""my sweet""/""but thou must"" flirting hasn't aged well.

Bingo: using it for Bards; would also count for Dreams, Prologues (introducing the magical elements, which is kind of superfluous because Eddi meets them in chapter two), Reference Materials (for the appendix). Borderline for romance-as-a-genre; I think the book might be better without the romantic plotlines, but it would also be a lot shorter.",fantasy

"If you are a Malazan fan, you owe it to yourself to read Adrian Tchaikovsky's 'Tyrant Philosophers' series","I've just recently finished the first two Tyrant Philosopher books from Tchaikovsky (there are three more to come, with Book #3 dropping this December), and IMHO these are easily the best work Tchaikovsky has done since Children of Time. 

Weirdly enough, I also found myself constantly reminded of Malazan Book of the Fallen while reading them. I am, admittedly, not a *massive* Malazan fan but I have read the series and I certainly appreciate it even if it was not always my cup of tea. 

I am convinced that Malazan fans looking for something to fill that void will devour City of Last Chances and House of Open Wounds, though.

**City of Last Chances** is set entirely in a single city that is under occupation by the Pallaseen sway, a foreign army that began on a small group of islands and is now seeking to 'perfect' the rest of the world by taking over it (sound familiar?). The story follows tons of various and interesting POVs as the city seeks to finally revolt and take its culture back from the Pals.  ***If you love the Darujistan sections of Malazan, you will love this book.*** 

**House of Open Wounds** is set about 6mo later and follows a medical unit within the marching Pallaseen army. This unit is made up of misfits - various Pal rejects and specialists, as well as non-Pal mages and priests with healing capabilities. We go on various adventures with this group and in the process learn more about the Pals and this word. ***If you loved the Bridgeburners sections of Malazan, you'll love this book.***

The main characters are dumb. And I don't mean poorly written, but actually *dumb*. They never learn from their mistakes, or do better the next time, if at all. Their age can apply to first half of the book but for the entire series?? No way.

They always underestimate their enemies while also stating how vicious and coniving those enemies are. They always dismiss information given to them from others, but then that information always comes back to be important. It's this repetition of nothing that drives me mad. What I hated most was how they acknowledge these characters always find out what they're doing  then proceed to do things that will get the character to come after them. 

Example:

This villain tortures people who are kind to the slaves. Character proceeds to be kind to the slaves right under the villains nose, and is surprised when gasp, that slave is punished and then they're shocked this person knew?? Why?? You are the one who said they do this, why are you shocked they weren't blind to your actions?? This happens ALL the time.

You also have every character being overly attractive in some way, these details mentioned where they're unnecessary. The insta love/attraction with Elias and Laia is jarring especially after how he treats Helene. They have no level of understanding nor knowledge of the other person. They talk maybe 4 times in the entire first book and are madly in love the second? Why? Because they trauma bonded? I need more than that. 

We also hype up characters as, ""the strongest"" then have that character beaten to a pulp, outwitted, and only showing that strength in the final moments where I don't care anymore. The amount of times said character gets hurt or almost died after being so remarkably strong is tiring. 

Another big problem is how often the characters don't care. ""I don't care if helping you will get you hurt, I'm going to do it anyway"", ""I don't care what the villain is doing  I want to know about the other villain even though they're working together and this info is probably valuable!"", ""I don't care that I took this job to help the dead, the living are more important"" this proceeds to end badly...so much of this  so so much of this

My hugest pet peeve was, ""this person looks familiar"" but they can't place them nonsense that happens at least 5 times in every single book. Goes back to how dumb these characters are made for the surprise factor of the plot.

Which, I call from every single book due to the stupidity of the characters. Anytime a character dismisses someone, possibly recognizes someone, or does the opposite a strong character would actually do in that scene; it's obvious whats going to happen next. 

The pregnancy trope is here, and it's done poorly. This character is a plot device only important for one of the MCs. Every time they're mentioned, I groaned in annoyance because what bad thing is happening now to get the MC to do something? 

The villains are cookie cutter bland. Why is this guy a bully? I don't know, book doesn't tell you anything besides they're bad. Their outcome wasn't satisfying, either. Another villain had an opportunity to have some depth  but we never see it. We only see them win over and over again because the MCs are written to underestimate them. Which by the way, is also a recurring plot point mentioned by the characters.

""They always underestimate me"" as this person proceeds to make poor decisions, gets beat up  etc

There are trials that amount to nothing. A torture that is forgotten and not acknowledged so a romance can happen, and that 4th books ending from what I've read spoiler wise, furthers my disdain. I had to DNF, I couldnt sit through it anymore.

I'm glad others enjoyed it--but for me--this was a huge no and struggle to read.",fantasy

Review - Space Punks 3 by Anna Mocikat,"https://beforewegoblog.com/review-space-punks-3-shadows-of-the-past-by-anna-mocikat/

SPACE PUNKS 3: SHADOWS OF THE PAST is the, appropriately enough, third volume of the Space Punks series by Anna Mocikat. It's very much like Cowboy Bebop meets Cyberpunk 2077. If that's an odd combination to imagine, just imagine a bunch of cyborg mercenaries in their cool spaceship going out and doing fantastic adventures. There's been a robot war akin to Terminator where humanity was almost wiped out by a bunch of androids that destroyed the Earth and has left humanity wandering around the solar system colonies (and a few wormhole granted ones) with a ruthless military dictatorship in charge.

If you're familiar with Anna Mocikat's BEHIND BLUE EYES series, you generally have an idea of how this book series goes. There's a lot of very sexy people, a lot of sexual innuendo but little on the page, a lot of graphic violence, and some interesting philosophical points about humanity. For example, one of the main characters, Nightingale, has lived his entire life as a hedonistic killer but a near-death experience as well as his realization he wants to only be with his long-time girlfriend causes him to question the meaning of life--much to his girlfriend, Aztec,'s chagrin.

This volume follows up the events of the previous and sees our heroes trapped on Mars with the Legion chasing them down. We get a lot of insight into the military dictatorship in charge of humanity since the conflict with the robots and they're generally a complete bunch of scumbags. One particular triggering character (and I mean that in the non-pejorative, quite literal) sense is Lucien who keeps a woman prisoner with an explosive in her head so he can regularly sexually extort her. Yeah, it's that kind of book. It's very R-rated but everything happens offscreen so I'd say this is about 80s levels of R-rated.

The actual plot is less the point in Space Punks than the characterization. It's less about the protagonists of the Nephilim having any specific goal and more about traveling with them as we get into their mindsets. Space Punks really feels more like an ongoing serial than a chronicle. There is plot, don't get me wrong, but it is far more interested in world-building and understanding the thought processes of all these various badass cyborgs, both men as well as women. This is an ensemble piece and benefits from it.

In conclusion, if you liked the first two then you will probably like this. I do hope that Lucien's prisoner gets her own development and revenge, though I somewhat doubt that is what's planned. I like the characters and I like the world. The series has recently gotten a Kickstarter to do a comic book and I hope they raise the money to be able to adapt the first book's adventures.",fantasy

"The Covenant Of Steel by Anthony Ryan is pretty dang solid, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.","I haven't read anything by Anthony Ryan before, but I know of the blood song series and its reviews, so I was hesitant to read this. However, I have been itching to read a classic medieval fantasy for a while now, and Covenant of steel fit the bill, so I thought sure why not and I am glad to have done so.

The series is a memoir of a fictional scribe - Alwyn, who follows Evadine, a woman burdened with divine visions. It chronicles her rise, her battles, her crusades from Alwyn's POV. Alwyn as a protagonist is great. I don't think he is anything incredible, but I was very invested in him and I loved the way he looked back on his younger self and talked to the reader ocasionally. Though he is billed as scribe, he is more of a soldier than anything, and these books are packed with battle scenes that are very fun to read. The central plot I'd say is very predictable, you can see where the story is going just from the themes itself, but it didn't make it any less enjoyable when the plot beats happen. There's a line from the last book that I think I'll remember for a long time.

The other characters are pretty good too. I didn't realise how much I was invested in them, when at a certain point in third book I was genuinely nervous about whether or not one of them was going to survive. I'll say that's a good enough character work if it provoked such strong feelings in me. We know Alwyn is going to survive, because after all we are reading his autobiography, but none of the side characters felt completely safe and that was very nice to read. I also really enjoyed the prose. It is a little long winded, but I liked it anyway. It made a nice contrast with all the brutal stuff happening in the series. The worldbuilding was fun too, though nothing I thought was too deep. However I'd love to learn more about this wolrd as it sounds very fascinating.

For the things I didn't like - The first 40 or so of every book in this series feels much weaker than the rest of the book. I don't know how to put it well. Its like you are waiting for the shoe to drop, for the book to tell you what this is going to be about, and it happens at about 40% mark in every book. Once that shoe drops, the rest of the story is incredibly engaging. Its not that the first 40% is bad or slow or anything, I enjoyed those, but neraly not as much the remaining portions.

Overall, I'd give it a 4/5, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants that medieval fantasy itch scratched. Trigger warnings: Death, lot of death, and lot of children dying. So keep that in mind.

PS: For those who've read the series, does anyone know if/when the author is planning to write a follow up series about a certain character Alwyn talks about at the end of the third book? I know there's a new series called Age Of Wrath set 20 years later that is releasing, but it doesn't look like it follows him. If the author has said anything about it, please let me know. I am desperate to read more about him.",fantasy

Book Review: Gift of the Shaper (Highblade #1) by DL Jennings,"**TL;DR Review:** Familiar-feeling classic high fantasy with some wonderfully surprising twists.

https://preview.redd.it/su64162n4ytd1.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cffc620bce32f372fa94ff1d4d7eaeb6c1797453

**Full Review:**

*Gift of the Shaper* is the ideal book for fans of classic fantasy—Eragon, Wheel of Time, Shannara, and Sword of Truth fans will instantly pick up what it’s putting down and be drawn into a story that feels familiar from the first page.

We begin by following Thornton, son of a blacksmith, trained in his father’s forge, who finds himself drawn into an unexpected adventure when he and his obvious romantic interest, Miera, are attacked late at night after a trip to the market. Their flight sends them into the ever-familiar “dark woods”, where they come across mythological creatures who save them from danger and point them in the direction of adventure.

But when Thornton returns home briefly to bid his father farewell, he finds his father gone—attacked and dragged away by enemies unknown. They set off with the help of these beings of myth, the Kienari, to track down their father.

That’s when the story really begins to expand. We get to see through the eyes of Orson, Thornton’s father, and a “half-eye” (mixed blood) prisoner who shares a cell with him. We’re introduced to the dark Khyth (mage?) D’kane and see the hideous blood magic rituals he is using to gather power.

And it just keeps getting bigger from there!

The book takes us on an adventure that covers the breadth and depth of the world—into the hidden Khyth stronghold in the mountains, a grand city where the magically gifted live among humans, into the depths of a mystical forest, and even into the Otherworld!

It has all the hallmarks of a classic high fantasy adventure story, with Thornton and Miera at its heart, but with other characters used to offer insight from both the “good” and “bad” perspectives.

The magic of the world—Breaking and Shaping—is fascinating and unique, and it’s amazing to see it in action, for better and worse. But as we come to see over the course of the book, there’s so much more than there seems at the beginning. By the end, the world will never be the same again—and the same for some of our characters.

The book isn’t afraid to go dark when necessary, but it sticks to the more surface-level violence and treachery common to high fantasy. There is death, loss, suffering, and grief, but there are also moments of wonder and beauty, of love and friendship, even reconciliation and new beginnings.

Best of all, it sets up some things to be expected and known as fact, only to flip them around on their head for some excellent revelations and twists.

An easy read, a familiar feel, and an adventure that will keep you turning those pages to find out what comes next!

I had originally pitched the story as what would happen if Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place was thrown into Downton Abbey with a bit of magic added in. While fun and funny, it also explores the themes of generational trauma, fraught sibling relationships, navigating the world as someone else's villain, and how childhood shapes us into who we grow up to be.

It is part humorous fairy tale, part twisty mystery centering around the younger of Cinderella’s stepsisters, Theo, and takes place a year and a half after the “happy ever after” we’re all familiar with. When Theo gets engaged to an ancient duke, her only way out is to summon the famed fairy godmother. But unlike Cinderella’s stories, the fairy doesn’t show up waving a magic wand or singing whimsical songs. And she’s certainly not interested in helping the infamous wicked stepsister. Instead, Theo must prove herself good and worthy of magical assistance by completing three selfless acts. Those acts end up taking Theo on a wild adventure filled with shenanigans and magical mayhem.

Thrilling Action or Deeper Meaning? What Hits Harder for You?,"I’ve always been into fantasy that digs into deeper ideas beyond just the magic and world-building. Like, take the *Alien*franchise.

Don’t get me wrong, I love a good epic battle and seing a fantasy world come to life, but when a story touches on deeper themes... it just interests me more.

It feels like there’s often a trade-off between intense, action-packed fantasy and stories that explore something more meaningful. I get why some people just want that high-energy, yeah I dont want to call it ""mindless"" thrill, but for me, the deeper stuff just hits differently.

Review: Dodger by Terry Pratchett,"Terry Pratchett is of course highly regarded for his Discworld series. The one or two of these that I tried didn't captivate me, so I figured that the stand-alone novel ""Dodger"" might be a better place to get introduced to Pratchett's work, given that this book has received decent ratings.

The story is set in Victorian London, and the premise is somewhat inspired by the Artful Dodger character from Charles Dickens. Our protagonist and hero is a 17 year old whom we know only as ""Dodger"". He's a ""tosher"", which means that he earns a livelihood scavenging sewers for coins and other valuables that have been washed down city drains.

After stepping in to rescue a young lady who was being assaulted, Dodger's fortunes begin to change significantly for the better. His hero status is further enhanced after he disarms the murderous barber Sweeney Todd. Soon he finds himself wearing fine clothes and mingling with the upper crusts of society. But can he save the mysterious lady he's rescued from the villains who want to bring her back to her abusive husband in another country? Dodger's clever plan to accomplish this rounds out the novel in a satisfying way.

The Victorian setting is both a strength and a weakness. Along the way Dodger gets introduced to figures of history that Pratchett has incorporated into his story, such as writer Charles Dickens, philanthropists Angela Burdett-Coutts and Henry Mayhew, politician Benjamin Disraeli, head of police Robert Peel, illustrator John Tenniel, and even the queen. I enjoyed learning about these historical personages, and even found myself heading to Wikipedia more than once to find out more about them. Pratchett also does a good job of evoking the setting of the time. The underground parts of the story in the sewer were especially interesting.

But there's also a downside to this historical setting. There's a lot of terminology from the period that isn't easy to understand, and this unnecessarily puts heavier demands on the reader. The book really needs an accompanying glossary of terms.

Besides the language, Pratchett's style also takes some getting used to. He can be witty and funny at times, and there are aspects of dry humour throughout. But it's not the kind of thing you can quickly skim read, because you risk missing a lot. Careful attention is needed to the details, and for me this made the story feel like harder work than an average book. However, this more likely reflects negatively on me as a reader rather than on Pratchett as a writer.

Those are minor criticisms, and I can easily overlook them. But for me what I especially had trouble with was the many instances of irreverence towards religion, particularly how it is voiced by Dodger's jeweller landlord Solomon Cohen. There's no profanity, but there are also numerous instances of crudeness, although that's to be expected given that a big part of the story has us follow a guy walking in the muck of sewers, and I can live with that.

I'd be interested to hear from readers more familiar with Pratchett's work whether characters irreverent to God or religion are a common feature in his Disc World, or whether what I encountered in ""Dodger"" is an exception for him.",fantasy

Just finished First Law Trilogy and I'm confused.,"I really loved these books (i read the first 3 so pls dont spoil later ones), the characters were some of the best I've read. I am confused about the overall structure of the story however. 

Each book ended in a way that felt a little arbitrary, as if the book just ended but the main story threads were unresolved. I assumed this was because the end of the 3rd book would be the true ending that tied it all together. This turned out not to be the case at all as the third book left me with more questions than answers (is logen alive, why can he talk to spirits, who will win between Khalul and bayaz, what do either of them even want, what will ferro do, etc). 

Do the other books pick up where the trilogy left off? Will I get my answers / a more traditional ending if I keep going?",fantasy
Fantasy that plays with the perception or comprehension of story-points or world-building elements?  ,"I have been thinking about the limits of human comprehension when it comes to observing the world. For example, perhaps when humans encounter Megastructures in sci-fi stories, I am thinking that they don't or can't comprehend it as a single object, at first. It takes the human mind to explore and understand parts of it and eventually come to the realization that this is a ginormous creature's head. 

Another one may be like, the notion that the planet Saturn is so huge it can fit 700+ Earths in it. To comprehend the size of it, just entering its atmosphere is a multi-week long process where your field of vision is filled by the complete curved expanse of Saturn (or just the Hexagon-shape hurricane at its pole that alone's like 4 times the size of Earth) for the next couple weeks of your decent.

"The boring hero is a must in a good story, which is why the villain gets all the attention, true?","Lately, I’ve been thinking about how most stories make the main character someone we can relate to, which is cool... but that also often makes them kind of bland. The MC can’t be some super genius psycho mastermind or overly complex figure, because people would stop seeing themselves in them (think *50 Shades of Grey* or *Twilight*—it's no coincidence the main character is always a “plain Jane”).

That’s why it’s usually the villain or the rival who ends up being way more interesting. Every story needs a *Vegeta*, *Shadow*, or *Sephiroth*—characters who challenge the hero or MC and bring a whole new dynamic to the plot.

Anyone else feel like the villains or rivals are sometimes more compelling than the main characters? What are some stories where you found yourself rooting more for the “bad guy” than the hero? Is that a good thing or does it hurt the story? Can it be avoided?",fantasy
The Blade Itself,"So, I’m finally getting around to reading this. I must say that it is worth the hype so far (I’m about 40% through). I feel like this was written for me. As advertised, the characters are excellent (the names are all perfect too!). There’s a lot of dark and depressing stuff going on, but it is all made enjoyable with the comedy of it all (mainly through dialogue, but not entirely). I also like how there are pieces of over-the-top ridiculous or absurd thoughts, actions, or dialogue, and yet it seems somehow realistic. It’s made an impression so far. ",fantasy
"Reading quality over quantity in fantasy, what are your thoughts? ","I think it’s so easy to get caught in a trap of constantly tracking the number of pages you have read, how long it will take to finish, trying to somehow get through your TBR and so on. Especially with things like Goodreads to track the percentage of your progress. I think this is a good thing and a bad thing really.

What I do miss is the actual immersion I used to feel when I read, especially when I was younger. So it made me think, is the quality of your reading more important than the quantity that you’re actually getting through? 

I’m finding that I’m just pushing through some books to get to the end, when I do actually love the book but it feels like a chore because I have to get another one ticked off my list.

On a quest to find a novel that has a gay romance in it!,"Ever since I read Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller I've been yearning for more gay romance. I'm a gay man who grew up reading fantasy, and I realized recently that I've *never* seen a gay main character in one of those fantasy novels. So now I'm on a fantastic quest of my own: find a fantasy novel that contains a gay romance (but isn't a romance novel).

 

The books I've received recommendations for have fallen into 3 categories that I'd like to avoid. I should note that there is nothing implicitly *wrong* with any of these themes it's just that they don't appeal to my tastes as a reader. 

 

- **Campy**. The characters are all generally very sassy and lay things on thick. Very tongue in cheek. It's a bit like a gay Hallmark movie or sitcom.

- **Erotica**. Explicit sex isn't the issue; I just vastly prefer deep and complex relationships that unfold over time. I also like there to be an actual plot that isn't just scaffolding for the romance.

- **Tragically gay**. Being gay is bad, and bad things will happen to you. The world hates you, you will not get the guy. Torture and assault are on the horizon. Not for me.

- **Forced ""romance.""** A surprising number of books feature straight men who are forced into situations where they must be gay. I'd rather the characters be interested in each other for genuine reasons.  
 

I know that this is a high bar, but I like the way that Le Guin wove romance into her books--and that some of those romances \*were\* gay or bisexual. Or perhaps how Garth Nix wrote the romance in Sabriel. Anything from high prose to standard sword and sorcery fits the bill. Surely such a thing must exist?

*(Quick side note: I know that this has been asked and answered, but a lot of the books on Reddit fall into those 4 categories that I'm trying to avoid.)*",fantasy
The First Age of Middle Earth remains under-read and under-rated. It is more accessible than you probably think.,"Layers upon layers of mythology, wars without end, (literally) earth-shattering magic, the gods as active participants in the world... a tale that spans an entire cosmos, in which primal forces clash with unrelenting fury. 

I am not talking about the Malazan series, the Cosmere, the Wheel of Time, or any other recent or on-going series, I am talking about JRR Tolkien's First Age. Thanks to the editorial work of Christopher Tolkien in the last decade of his life (following on his dense, academic, and largely inaccessible History of Middle Earth), there is now a definitive reading list for the First Age, and it is much, much larger than the Silmarillion. It consists of two parts - **The Silmarillion** and **The Great Tales.**

**The Silmarillion** is probably the main challenge people have when approaching the First Age. It is the definitive, central work, and there is no way around it. It is also a brilliant and, in my opinion, somewhat misunderstood novel. It is not a collection of short stories or a purely mythological narrative - it is a novel, albeit an unconventional novel. More specifically, it is a novel in which the main characters are all elves, and which is written from an elvish perspective, where the 500 years of the story take about the same amount of perceived time as the 5 months of Lord of the Rings. It is a daunting read, but once it ""clicks"" it is one of those novels which you will always miss reading whenever you read anything else. 

**The Great Tales** are the three main human-centered stories from the final century of the First Age and as such all take place within the narrative of the Silmarillion. They consist of **The Children of Hurin, Beren and Luthien,** and **The Fall of Gondolin.** These stories have existed for a long time, but until Christopher Tolkien edited them into definitive single-volume editions, you had to dig through multiple History of Middle Earth volumes to read them in their entirety. 

Of the three books, **the Children of Hurin** is the only one which is edited into a full-length novel, and it is very good but very dark and grim. **Beren and Luthien** is probably the least accessible volume, but features the outstanding Lay of Leithian, which is a poetic narrative rather than a prose narrative. **The Fall of Gondolin** is my favorite of the Great Tales volumes by far and reads like a novel even though it is more of a collection of stories. It is also the one that benefits the most from a stand-alone volume, as the tale is given only a very brief summary in the Silmarillion. All three contain a novel's worth of content and feature the ""human"" perspective of the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings rather than the ""elvish"" perspective of the Silmarillion.

**As for the reading order...**

*Publication Order:* This should be your first choice.

1. The Silmarillion. (if you only read one First Age book, let it be this one)

2. The Children of Hurin. 

3. Beren and Luthien.

4. The Fall of Gondolin.

If you find the Silmarillion too difficult, try the following in order until something works. First, skip the first two chapters, Ainulindale and Valaquenta... these are not part of the Silmarillion proper, but rather the equivalent of ""concerning hobbits"" in Lord of the Rings. Second, if you still can't get into it, skip ahead to the chapter ""Of Beren and Luthien"" and read that one first. Third, if this doesn't work, change up the reading order.

*Hurin-First Order:* Try this if the Silmarillion is too tough at first.

1. The Children of Hurin. (if you only read one First Age book but can't make it through the Silmarillion, let it be this one)

2. The Silmarillion.

3. Beren and Luthien.

4. The Fall of Gondolin.

*Great Tales First:* If you enjoy Children of Hurin but the Silmarillion is still an impassable roadblock, try the following reading order.

1. The Children of Hurin. 

2. ""Of Beren and Luthien"" (Chapter) from the Silmarillion.

3. The Fall of Gondolin.

4. Beren and Luthien (book)

5. The Silmarillion. 

**In summary,** the First Age writings of JRR Tolkien constitute one of the pinnacles of modern fantasy literature, and are more accessible than they have ever been. There are numerous ways to explore and enjoy these books, even for those who are struggling with the Silmarillion. ",fantasy
Slump for a while and Need Help,"Hello all, I’ve kind of been in a slump lately and I’m in the mood for something more specific which has led me to pick up and put down a lot, I’ve also tried researching, but I thought it best to ask you all for help to get better results. This might be long, I want to try and give the best idea of what I’m after, I’d appreciate your help.

Some things I’m looking for are:
-Gripping character(s): I need to be able to actually care for the character(s) or I find it hard to stay with it, I’m not saying they have to be morally good.

-Grim Dark: I think this sub genre brings a lot of reality in a way to these stories that I really appreciate plus I like the violence and moral ambiguity 

-Atmospheric and Adventure esc: I don’t necessarily want a good portion of the story being the same place or the plot set on just one thing, I want there to be adventure and variety. I’m thinking, dungeons or caves, necromancy or the undead, good action, cool atmosphere (forests, abandoned buildings/ architecture…)

I don’t shy away from thicker books or series, and it does have to be adult, otherwise it doesn’t have to take every box but the closer the better. But my real question is does something like this exist?

"Another handful of bingo reviews: The Death of the Necromancer, The Martian, The Calculating Stars, Floating Hotel, and Elder Race","I had fallen out of touch with what was going on with speculative fiction over the last couple of decades, and I have been trying to get back in touch with who is writing books that I can really enjoy.  I’ve been using the bingo reading challenge to, well, challenge myself to read new to me authors.  I’m not the most active poster on the sub, but I do want to give back to the sub with some reviews of what I’ve been reading.  My idiosyncratic rating scale is: excellent (reserved for books that hold up on re-reading), really very good, very good, good, ok, meh, and DNF.  I’m happy to say that since last time I shared some bingo reviews, I don’t have any DNFs to report, and there were some books that I was very pleased with (one of which I liked so much I’m planning to give it a separate review).

***The Death of the Necromancer*** **by Martha Wells**

**Rating**: good

**Stats**: Gas lamp fantasy with some mystery, dual third person POV/past tense

**Bingo squares**: Under the Surface, Criminals, 1990s

A young man, aided by his lover and a circle of friends and employees, is set on revenge against the man who framed his foster father, but he is distracted from his goal by the interference of someone who appears to be dabbling in necromancy.

It took several chapters before I was hooked, and even then, I felt somewhat remote from the story.  The characters are likable, mature, and complex, but this is not a character driven story (I probably would have enjoyed it more if character motivation were more prominently featured).  I have seen some comments that this features found family, and I understand why people say so, but it seemed more like a collection than a family.  It is possible that I would have been more engaged if the pace had been zippier.  There’s some banter and witticisms, but I had hoped for more.  

I had read that the protagonist begins as an anti-hero, and many reviewers on Storygraph seem to think that this is dark.  I feel that the protagonist is light grey, at most.  We certainly spend a lot of time in sewers or catacombs, so literally in dark surroundings, but it wasn’t bleak or depressing or morally challenging.

I suspect that this would appeal more to people who are drawn to either mysteries or plot driven stories.  I don’t read mysteries critically, so I cannot say whether this hit that magic middle that neither under- nor over-telegraphs the plot twists and solutions to the mysteries.  I did enjoy the sneaky way that the protagonist finally got his revenge.  

***The Martian*** **by Andy Weir**

**Rating**: really very good (and I fully anticipate that it will hold up on re-reading)

**Stats**: near future hard science fiction, primarily single first person POV/present tense as a log, with interludes of multiple third person POV/past tense

**Bingo Squares**: Multi-POV, Survival, Reference material

I’m possibly the last person to get around to reading this, and I’m sure that another review isn’t really needed, but here goes anyway.  Man, what a blast!  It sets a cracking pace.  It is the quintessential survival story, full of problem solving and suspense.  And, it’s funny besides. I’m not going to say that it is flawless.  The main thing that I noticed is that the amount of exposition doesn’t seem realistic for an astronaut’s log, but from a storytelling perspective it works.  The ending is a little abrupt.  But that’s just nitpicking, and the book is a superb read.   I’m very glad that between bingo and browbeating from my kid, I finally got around to reading this.

***The Calculating Stars*** **by Mary Robinette Kowal**

**Rating**: very good

**Stats**: alternate history science fiction, single first person POV/past tense, Jewish main character, depictions of sexism and racism

**Bingo Squares**: First in a series, main character with a disability (panic attacks), side character with a disability (paralysis secondary to polio), survival

The premise is that in an alternate history 1950s, a meteorite strikes the Chesapeake Bay and causes an extinction event, leading to acceleration of attempts to get into space, so that the moon and mars can be colonized before Earth is unihabitable.  The protagonist is a “computer” at the space agency, a pilot, and wants to become an astronaut, despite the sexism of the time.  

I cannot independently speak to how plausible it is, but in an endnote Kowal outlines the efforts to which she has gone to in order to “play fair with the science” (as she says).  She had a team of people, including pilots, historians, astronauts, astronautical engineers, doctors, and astronomers, among others helping her, although she admits that there are places that she “cheated.”  This book is reminiscent of *Hidden Figures* in feel, but she had been writing this before either the book or the movie came out.

This caught me right away and kept me absorbed the entire book.  I was invested in the protagonist and her struggles.  I have some questions about how accurately the panic attacks rep is handled.  The explanation for why she has panic attacks doesn’t seem realistic to me.  And, her approach (as a pilot) to dealing with her panic attacks, doesn’t match what I would have expected a pilot to do given what I know of recent FAA policies (which might not have been in place in the 1950s).  However, none of that interfered with my enjoyment of the story.  I think that Kowal does an excellent job of balancing character development, an array of intersectional issues (racism and religion are touched on, as well as sexism), and the hard science fiction of the technical details of the space effort.  I look forward to reading the next book in the series!

***Floating Hotel*** **by Grace Curtis**

**Rating**:  ok

**Stats**: science fiction (not hard, not soft, so I guess medium), multiple third person POV/almost entirely past tense, TW: off page torture and off page murder

**Bingo Squares**: Criminals (arguably HM), Multi-POV (HM), 2024, Judge a Book by Its Cover, Space Opera (I don’t feel that this is actually a space opera, but it does meet the bingo definition).  

I have mixed feelings about this book.  It has multiple POVs, changing every chapter. It’s an interesting choice, and I do feel that it has been done fairly well. Still, I think that is part of why I initially had difficulty connecting to the book, since how I connect with the characters has a huge impact on my enjoyment of a book. Also, the book is fairly slice of life at first, and so there isn’t much plot moving things forward either at first.  Now, I was expecting a cozy, slice of life, optimistic, feel-good saga, with found family and a safe haven, so the initial lack of plot movement wasn’t surprising.  

However, reading this, I felt like this was somewhat bait and switch.  I knew that it had a mystery, but I thought it was going to be a cozy mystery.  For me, it turned darker than I expected.  Although the torture and murder are off page, for me (and I am sensitive to these things) it still evoked more ugliness, fear, and tension than I prefer.  And if this is found family, it’s a pretty dysfunctional found family, with some real animosity within it.  The safe haven is more of an illusion or a temporary reprieve.

One of the characters says: *“It’s hard. Making things end in a way that’s satisfying is hard.”*  Which is ironic, because the ending isn’t entirely satisfying.

Still, there’s a lot to like here.  As I mentioned earlier, the multiple POVs are handled really well.  The characters are interesting and layered, including the late manager whom we barely meet directly.  The *Grand Abeona Hotel,* an aging luxury space hotel is depicted vividly and lovingly, including the shabbier behind the scenes aspects.  And some deeper themes are explored.  Relatively early on, we start to read dispatches from a pamphlet critiquing and exposing the secrets of the oppressive Empire.  More subtly, we also see how peoples experiences and surroundings do or do not shape their personalities.

So, all told, it wasn’t a great book for me, but I think it is likely a good or great book for someone else.

***Elder Race*** **by Adrian Tchaikovsky**

**Rating**: good

**Stats**: science fantasy (of the lost colony variety), dual POV, one is first person/present tense, one is third person/past tense

**Bingo Squares**: Character with a Disability (depression) HM, Judge a Book By Its Cover, Eldritch Creature (HM), Readalong

As I said, I’m exploring new to me authors, and this is the first book I’ve read by Tchaikovsky.  I have an affinity for anthropological science fiction, prefer my reading to be light rather than dark, and have a touch of arachnophobia, so this seemed like a good place to start.  Furthermore, I was looking for a book for the Eldritch Creature bingo square that honored the prompt, but wasn’t too eerie for me, and this seemed like a promising option.

The premise is that a young princess, Lyn, seeks assistance from a wizard, Nyr, to defeat a demon, but Nyr is actually an anthropologist with “sufficiently advanced technology.”  The point of view alternates between the two of them, and we get to see how very differently they view their shared world.  

I have mixed feelings about this novella.  It was a pleasant and easy read, and I enjoyed the central conceit of contrasting Lyn and Nyr’s understanding of their history and their actions.  However, I really had difficulty with how Tchaikovsky set the stage for the story he wanted to tell.  I do not believe that anthropologists can do field work by observing clandestinely.  I also could not accept the Dissociative Cognition System that supposedly allows Nyr to suppress his emotions in order to act more efficiently.  In reality, without experiencing emotions, we do not have the motivation (rational or irrational) that drives our actions.  

Beyond my objections to how Tchaikovsky lay the foundations for the work, I also noticed that I felt disengaged.  I liked the protagonists, but didn’t connect to them emotionally, since they did not seem fully realized.  Similarly, I didn’t feel any visceral response to the havoc the “demon” wreaks.  On the other hand, I liked that Tchaikovsky sidestepped some tropes.  I love a good romance subplot, but it wasn’t necessary here.  I also appreciated that instead of explaining the “demon” as the classic ancient war machine gone amuck, Tchaikovsky opted instead to leave the demon as inexplicable and unnatural, even to the understanding of someone with greater technology.  And ultimately, I did enjoy Tchaikovsky’s comparison of a fantastical vs a technological explanation of a world.  I’m not in a rush to read more Tchaikovsky, but I won’t avoid him, either.  If you’re looking for something short and undemanding, but still interesting, I think this suits.  ",fantasy

Most inventive / best-delivered magic system,"Magic can be such a huge part of fantasy, but everyone has their faves. I really like creative magic systems that still keep it 'soft'.

Earthsea is another, as is The Second Apocalypse and Malazan's Warren's.

**First in a Series**

City of the Plague God, *Sarwat Chadda* (4/5)

* I read this when I was sick and my brain was too foggy to handle my big-boy-books. It's a middle-grade novel written by an author that wrote a series I loved as a kid. I loved how it wrote about Mesopotamian mythology, and had some genuinely unsettling and gory scenes. It also has a great emotional throughline that made me tear up a little bit to be honest. It has some downsides just from being for kids- the writing's a bit simplistic and there's some stuff in it that's just silly, but that's to be expected.



**Alliterative Title**

Cat's Cradle, *Kurt Vonnegut* (3.5/5)

* I really loved Slaughterhouse Five also by Vonnegut but felt that this wasn’t quite as good. The first half is the best part, but as it goes on it feels more removed from reality in a way that diminished its impact for me. But the first half is really good- it’s funny with good social commentary. I especially liked Bokononism and thought it was an interesting take on determinism and the purpose of religion as a whole.



**Under the Surface**

The Fisherman, *John Langan* (2/5)

* I've seen this book recommended on reddit a lot, but to be honest I found it pretty dull. Has some interesting concepts and imagery, and I appreciated how it incorporated German folklore. But otherwise I didn't find it all that interesting, it just felt like a soulless mashup of Lovecraft and Pet Sematary. Although it could also be that I didn't relate to the protagonist or the theme of grief. I also kept expecting that guy to be done with his story. If someone talked to me in a diner for that long I'd just leave honestly.



**Criminals**

Monstrilio, *Gerardo Samano Cordova* (2/5)

* I was really expecting to love this book. The premise sounded awesome and I’d heard nothing but praise. Unfortunately, the execution was not good. Nothing happens in it except at the very beginning and the very end. I didn’t find the characters at all interesting or felt that they developed. Their reactions to Monstrilio didn’t make sense to me. The book moves between Mexico City, Berlin and NYC, but there’s never any sense of place- it could have been set in one nondescript location and there wouldn’t have been a difference. The prose is staccato and dull. I also did not like the audiobook narration and I think it definitely lessened my enjoyment. It’s also mismarketed as a horror novel- it is not at all. 



**Dreams**

The Killing Moon, *NK Jemisin* (5/5)

* I absolutely loved this book! So incredible and I especially loved the original magic system and worldbuilding. It felt like such a vivid and real place. Super creative and well thought out. I loved the setting based on ancient Egypt but incorporating Jungian ideas about dreams. Had some really interesting themes, especially in the arc of the character Ehiru. I'm not all that interested in the sequel though, as it doesn't seem like it expands the world all that much.



**Entitled Animals**

King Rat, *China Mieville* (4/5)

* Mieville is one of my favorite authors and this is his debut novel. It’s rough around the edges, has some overly gorey shock value scenes, and doesn’t quite have the masterful worldbuilding he’s known for, but man I loved it. It has this really intoxicating rhythm that made me enjoy every page. I loved the way it described music, and I found the emotional conflicts compelling and grounded. Ending was great.



**Bards**

The Master and Margarita, *Mikhail Bulgakov (trans. Hugh Alpin)* (3/5)

* This book is very whimsical, creative and esoteric. It has layered narratives incorporating politics and the Bible. I found it difficult to connect with though, and didn’t find that it lived up to the hype. I didn’t get all the references, or understand the connections between the different storylines. The characters were really difficult to keep track of. I thought the Pontius Pilate story was the most interesting part, especially in contrast to Soviet atheism.



**Prologues and Epilogues**

The Night Circus, *Erin Morgenstern* (5/5)

* I think I read this when I was a kid, but I'm not counting it as a reread because I literally remembered nothing about it. But anyways, amazing book with beautiful writing. I don't normally get into romance, but I was really invested in it! My favorite part was the ensemble cast- each character was so unique and colorful. I especially liked Tsukiko, the contortionist with a tragic backstory that is such a good reveal. I also loved the different timelines and how they wove together.



**Self/Indie Published**

The Breath of the Sun, *Isaac Fellman* (4/5)

* I don’t normally read indie books, especially obscure ones such as this, but I’m really glad I did! It’s very philosophical. The main character is a mountain climber and the book explores how this relates to religion, death, life, magic, love, and science. Her internal monologues are so good. The descriptions are often beautiful and breathtaking. I also like the way the relationships were written- they felt very specific and real. It’s not very plot driven and is sometimes boring, but overall a great book. 



**Romantasy**

The Spear Cuts Through Water, *Simon Jimenez* (5/5)

* I was dreading the Romantasy square as I'm not really into romance but I thought this was beautifully executed. I found it a pretty challenging read, but extremely rewarding. It had this beautiful mythological feel. The prose was gorgeous. I loved how it incorporated different POVs in an incredibly original way. It was so incredibly original while at the same time feeling like an ancient story. I loved all the characters. There were also some very gripping and horrific moments.



**Dark Academia**

The Library at Mount Char, *Scott Hawkins* (2/5)

* I was instantly hooked by this book. But unfortunately it was all downhill from there. I thought the mythology it created was genuinely really interesting. But it just felt like every element was so poorly executed. There were some things that were cool because of the mystery and weirdness but it felt like they were ruined by being elaborated on. I would have DNF'd if not for bingo. Hated the ending too. Low rating mostly out of spite for getting my expectations up at the beginning.



**Multi POV**

Palimpsest, *Catherynne Valente* (5/5)

* I honestly was not prepared for this book- it was so beautiful and heartbreaking. The prose is lyrical and gorgeous. Each character's arc is fascinating, I loved how each character had their own obsession that drove them. And Palimpsest itself was so surreal and strange yet so amazing, I could see why they were all drawn to it. It has absolutely incredible and dreamlike worldbuilding. The way it wrote about sex and queerness was fascinating. I liked how it didn’t fall into familiar moralistic tropes. 



**Published in 2024**

Beautyland, *Marie Helene Bertino* (4/5). 

* Loved this book. Very poignant and beautiful. It really captures how it feels to grow up feeling strange and out of place. You could tell it was written from the author’s own personal experience, it felt very real. The speculative elements of it were low-key and understated. It was quite slow in places, but I think it served the purpose of the book. I didn’t really like that she had to move to NYC and become a writer though, it made it feel more generic. 



**Disabled Character**

The Bedlam Stacks, *Natasha Pulley* (3.5/5)

* Had some really interesting themes around language, nature, and disability. Was very beautifully atmospheric. However, I thought the ending was disappointing and made the book as a whole feel flat. Also generally reallyyy slow (especially for the first third or so). But had some genuinely great and original stuff in the middle. I could tell the author did a lot of research into this time period as well as Incan culture.



**Published in the 90s**

Small Gods, *Terry Pratchett* (4.5/5)

* This was my first time reading a Terry Pratchett book in full and I loved it! I thought it was really funny and I laughed aloud multiple times. It also had some brilliant social commentary. I love books that explore religion in interesting ways and this one definitely does.



**Orcs, Trolls &amp; Goblins**

Under the Pendulum Sun, *Jeannette Ng* (3.5/5)

* Really cool premise but I felt it wasn't executed to the fullest extent unfortunately. I loved the combination of historical fiction and fae folklore. However, it didn't actually explore this very interesting world all that much. The main two characters were pretty flat but I really liked the side characters, especially Ariel, the changeling. Apparently it's written by a historian and I think you can really tell in how the history is incorporated which is really cool.



**Space Opera**

A Memory Called Empire, *Arkady Martine* (3.5/5)

* I appreciated this category because space operas are usually not at all what I read, so it was nice to read something different. This was a beautifully written book with really interesting descriptions of language and culture. I loved the imago-machines, I thought it was an awesome concept that made the narration really cool when it was present, which was unfortunately a very small amount of the book. Overall it was kind of boring because it was a lot of political intrigue and it was hard to keep track of the names. The side characters blended together. I really liked the ending, although I wasn’t that into the romance element.



**Author of Color**

The Devourers, *Indra Das* (5/5)

* This book was amazing! It had beautiful prose. Love how it combined different folklore about werewolves and shapeshifters. The story-in-a-story was really cool- I loved how the two timelines wove together. It explored the connections between queerness, violence, sex, nonconformity and storytelling. It was genuinely really philosophical and interesting, and it felt like it was left up to the reader to decide what to take away from it.



**Survival**

Chain-Gang All-Stars, *Nana Kwame Adjei Brenyah* (3.5/5)

* This book was a really difficult read, which makes sense for it being a dark satire of the American prison system. The dystopian world it creates is truly brutal and horrifying, but it's clear that it's close to our own. The different interlocking POVs really enhance the story. My issue though is that it's painfully unsubtle with its messaging, the most blatant example of this being footnotes with relevant real-life statistics and facts. I just think this betrays an insecurity that the book isn't getting its point across, which it definitely is.



**Judge a Book by Its Cover**

The Navigating Fox, *Christopher Rowe* (4.5/5)

* This is the first book I can remember going in completely blind. I thought the cover was so gorgeous but was nervous about having no context. But I ended up loving it. I loved the flashback sequences and it has such a cool ending that brought everything together. My fave part was the setting- I NEED to see more written in this world! I loved the concept of creatures that are given sentience through a mysterious alchemical process, and how the world is (very loosely) based on Ancient Rome.



**Set in a Small Town**

Negative Space, *BR Yeager* (4/5)

* This book is a very interesting horror novel about aimless, self-destructive teens in a depressing little town. It uses very creative storytelling techniques, like forum messages, excerpts from books, and blurring the lines between hallucination and reality. The tone is very well crafted, the book feels crushing and dark. I especially liked the hallucinatory scenes. However, there’s a pretty insane amount of gratuitous violence, self harm, and suicide. Much of the time it felt solely for shock value, especially because many of the incidents were forgotten by the next page. 



**Five Short Stories**

Her Body and Other Parties, *Carmen Maria Machado* (5/5)

* I absolutely adored this book. It’s a collection of stories that explore the horror of queerness, sexuality, abuse, and womanhood. All of the stories are so beautifully written and yet so unsettling. Each one incorporates offbeat experimental elements that I loved. For example, one includes instructions for reading the story aloud. Another is formatted as a series of Law &amp; Order episode summaries. 



**Eldritch Creatures**

The Saint of Bright Doors, *Vajra Chandrasekera* (4/5)

* This book has an incredibly creative setting, mixing Buddhist mythology with modern politics and technology. I found the main character dryly funny and very relatable. The social commentary is really interesting, especially because it’s coming from a non-Western perspective (unlike most of the books I read).  It’s one of those books that has really stuck with me, and I find myself thinking about it probably the most out of any on this list. 



**Reference Materials**

When The Angels Left The Old Country, *Sacha Lamb* (3.5/5)

* This book was (mostly) quite a fun and charming read. I loved the characters and their dynamics. It’s really cool how it incorporated Jewish history and religion. The reference material was a glossary, which was quite helpful for many of the terms used. It was very enjoyable to read for the most part. However, it dragged a lot in the last third or so. There were just a lot of confusing plot elements that didn’t really connect with me and I had to push myself to finish. 



**Book Club**

Strange Beasts of China, *Yan Ge (trans. Jeremy Tiang)* (3/5)

* This had an interesting format; I liked the contrast between the scientific classification and the magical beasts. Unfortunately I thought it got pretty repetitive and boring before long. It had some cool concepts but not all of them were interesting. I also felt like I missed a lot of the references that a Chinese audience would get. Sadly, I feel like every time I've read a book for book clubs (I've been part of a few different ones, mostly IRL) I'm unimpressed.",fantasy
Fantasy coded dog names -- male golden retriever,"So, I've had a bit of a shit time of it.  My amazing 14 year old Shar Pei, Gryffindor (Gryff for short -- see posts for a pic) went over the rainbow bridge in May.  My wife and partner of 18 years and I separated in July.  Then I had a cancer scare -- I've been NED for a couple of years -- in August which, thankfully was not actually the big C.  Anyway, I've been through an entire shitty country song in the last four and a half months.  Moving into winter I don't want to be alone.

So I started passively looking for pups.  I contacted an assistive dog training program to adopt any washouts.  I reached out to a couple of breeders that were recommended, but pups would be six months out.  A buddy mentioned that our local humane society has a ""first contact"" program, where you give them what you are looking for and they give you a sorta right of first refusal before they make it generally available.

So, longish story short, looks like I'm getting a golden retriever pup on Sunday.

So, like my last pup, I would like a fantasy related name, preferably a strong one syllable (because I think that's most of what he'll hear).  I was leaning towards Kal (Kaladin), but that's the name of a recently departed sports coach, and I don't want people thinking I named him after that coach.  

So.....any recommendations?",fantasy

I had originally pitched the story as what would happen if Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place was thrown into Downton Abbey with a bit of magic added in. While fun and funny, it also explores the themes of generational trauma, fraught sibling relationships, navigating the world as someone else's villain, and how childhood shapes us into who we grow up to be.

It is part humorous fairy tale, part twisty mystery centering around the younger of Cinderella’s stepsisters, Theo, and takes place a year and a half after the “happy ever after” we’re all familiar with. When Theo gets engaged to an ancient duke, her only way out is to summon the famed fairy godmother. But unlike Cinderella’s stories, the fairy doesn’t show up waving a magic wand or singing whimsical songs. And she’s certainly not interested in helping the infamous wicked stepsister. Instead, Theo must prove herself good and worthy of magical assistance by completing three selfless acts. Those acts end up taking Theo on a wild adventure filled with shenanigans and magical mayhem.

Revisiting a childhood favorite story: ‘Dreams are Sacred’ still delights,"I had a blast Sunday re-reading one of my favorite stories from when I was 12 years old: ""Dreams are Sacred,"" by a writer named Peter Phillips. It was easy to track down -- a quick Google search on the title (which fortunately I remembered) led me to the Internet Archive and a complete scan of the magazine where it was first published: [Astounding Science Fiction, September, 1948][1]

[1]: https://archive.org/details/AstoundingScienceFictionv42n1

The story holds up -- it's exciting, fast-paced and funny.

The hero is Pete Parnell, a fast-talking wisecracking New York sportswriter who is recruited by his friend Steve Blakiston, a psychiatrist, to help with an experimental technique that could cure the madness of a science fiction and fantasy writer named Marsham Craswell. The writer has fallen into an unconscious fugue state and is trapped in an endless dream scenario from his own stories, which resemble Conan the Barbarian or Barsoom.

Fortunately, Blakiston has invented a machine which allows one person to enter another's dream. Parnell is tapped for the job of curing Blakiston because Parnell is the fastest-thinking and hardest-headed person Blakiston knows.

Supporting characters include a friendly cop with an Irish accent straight out of cartoons, a surly cab driver and a sexy lounge singer.

I found the story every bit as enjoyable as I did when I was 12 years old. Old-fashioned? Sure! That's part of the fun.

[Phillips][2], the author, was no New Yorker -- he was English. He was a newspaperman who wrote about two dozen science fiction stories. He died in 2012, age 92. In addition to ""Dreams are Sacred,"" he also wrote another story I loved when I was a boy, ""Manna,"" about a stack of canned super-food that gets transported accidentally back in time to a medieval monastery. Hilarity ensues.

More on Phillips [here][3], including some wonderful old magazine and book covers.

[3]: https://classicsofsciencefiction.com/2019/09/30/forgotten-science-fiction-writer-peter-phillips/

[Astounding Science Fiction,][4] the magazine ""Dreams are Sacred"" appeared in, was founded in 1930, with the delicious title, ""Astounding Stories of Super-Science."" Beginning in 1939, under editor John Campbell, Astounding published groundbreaking writers including Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. The magazine changed its name to Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction in 1960 and still publishes today, under the name [Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact][5].

[5]: https://www.analogsf.com/

Also last weekend, I re-read another favorite from the same period, [""The Push of a Finger,""][6] by Alfred Bester. And I downloaded one more, ""Farewell to the Master,"" by Harry Bates, which was the basis for the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""

[6]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm

I read all three stories when I was a boy, in the fat, two-volume anthology, [""The Astounding-Analog Reader,""][7] which I checked out of the East Northport Public Library about a dozen times, every time I was in the mood to re-read it.

[7]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32317590-the-astounding-analog-reader-book-one

All three stories have newspapermen as heroes. I guess those stories made an impression -- I have made my career in journalism of one form or another for my entire life. (In addition to those stories, I also devoured Superman, Spider-Man, and especially the Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. I wanted to be Lou Grant when I grew up. I still do.)

"Ancillary Justice...and, what happened?!","Hello Dear SciFi Reader Friends,

First off, the first book in the series, Ancillary Justice, was absolutely wonderful. I loved everything about it.

I love being dropped in the middle of the story and swapping chapters with the main character's past. It keeps a reader invested.

The idea of a ship AI with human ancillaries, is a wonderful concept. I like that they toy with you a bit, as to how the whole process works.

A galactic ruler with several thousand bodies, is another wonderful idea (something that has been done before, of course). It juxtaposes against the main character's status as an ancillary, in a lot of fun and nuanced ways. They are both parts of a greater whole and more similar than dissimilar. The galactic ruler has more in common with her ship AIs than she does humans.

I really felt the struggle of Justice of Toren and how they describe being cut off from their ship, their body, their way of living.

It was fun to have a main character who could perfectly read human beings, with an explicit reason for doing so. They aren't simply some deus ex machina unicorn, who can magically read human faces better than anyone in the universe. They spent thousands of years studying and knowing everything about humans and is able to use those skills, to gain an upper hand.

There are so many good things to say about this book. I read it in a few days and immediately went to buy the next two books.

I cruised through them in another handful of days, I think I was waiting for something to happen, waiting for the original vision of the first book to come to fruition. It never happened. Nothing happened, really.

I felt like I read a hard sci-fi novel and then I was given two sequels that were ghostwritten by a YA novelist...and not a particularly good one.

At the end of the day, I did read them, I didn't throw them down out of disgust, but I can't say I liked most of what I read.

Anaander was quite foolish and incompetent. When she spoke, I felt like I was reading a superhero villain script. For someone who has lived for 3000 years, conquered all her enemies and held on to control with an iron fist. She is easily outwitted and seems to understand very little.

I don't know how to say this without sounding coarse...but I do not give a shit about one small space station and tea plantation rights. I am reading a book series about a galactic empire at civil war with itself and instead I felt like someone read a book about a tea plantation uprising in 1940s India and slapped that into this book. I was bored and confused.

Breq knows evvverrryyythhinnngg and is always right. She takes complex human problems that have existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years, shows up, observes for several minutes, then tells everyone what to do to solve the problems. They do what Breq wants and it works flawlessly. Not only is this not how human beings work, problems like this take much more time and nuance to solve...and hard work. I felt like I was given a social studies lesson, targeted at an audience of children or young adults.

Do you remember I mentioned how much I loved the omittance of any deus ex machina in the original book? Why don't we slap a goofy alien translator in a book and they act as the magic button to solve everything. Let's also make them like a character from peewees playhouse. The first book made me feel like the translators were very smart, dangerous and unsettling. What we got was very light comedic relief that solved every problem for everyone. I did not like this.

I could go on and on. On the positive side, I did like the various AIs and found their struggles, to be quite interesting. They were often nuanced and put in impossible situations, themselves and the author did an interesting job of playing those scenarios out.

I can only guess that the first book took years and years to write and the next two books were under contract to be written as soon as possible.

I can't really think of a series I was more disappointed in. Usually if I love a first book, the remaining books are quite interesting. I hate to say it, but I wish I didn't buy them at all, which is not something I typically feel or say.

If I have to sum up my feelings...it feels like the first book is a dark and gritty rated R movie. The two sequels are PG13 and focus on being silly more than serious.

Maybe I'm missing something and someone can set me straight. can't be the only one who feels the way I do, but someone has to love the sequels and I'm curious what you have to say about it?",scifi

"I read Three-Body Problem, now I watched","I'm a non-native English speaker. My English level is far from perfect, so my apologies firstly if something is wrong in my text, or if I look dumb by not understanding some simple concepts.  

I was the guy who was reading Three-Body Problem with a dictionary in my other hand.



I was shocked that I had lost so many scenes that I could be excited to understand better when I watched the Netflix adaptation of Three-Body Problem.



\[A little spoiler alert from here\]

The first thing to comment on is the Universe blinking. As I remember in the original novel, that was not about the actual stars blinking, but the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) blinking. The blinking starry night gave me a real trippy feeling, like: ""Oh wow, I will definitely panic in that situation"".

I also liked the authentic CMB blinking, because it's much more about Science breaking into pieces, by something with a billion years old blinking, this blew my mind.



The Three-Body Game (The next generation VR game) was also abstract in my head. (that's also because I'm not a specialist in Chinese history, so I couldn't imagine the scene well.)

However, in the series, I could feel the scene. When I saw the movement of the multiple suns, moving chaotically, as it may look on a real planet inside a triple star system, curving, distancing, or approximating from the planet.  


About the Judgement Day's end. I was also freaked out by how this scene was horrible. The invisible fibers hunting the passengers. That was a next level experience.

How would you make the borg more terrifying?,"

In my opinion, the borg are a good example of good concept yet bad execution.

They just seem so vanilla and not as horrifying as they could be, I was expecting them to be the Star Trek equivalent of Tyranids, that level of horror.

Maybe they have aggressive terraforming abilities that go alongside the assimilation?

Perhaps they have an arsenal of nonhuman aliens to use as drones to overwhelm others?

It could be that they use drones as biological tools and warp their bodies into utilities

And then there’s the cubes, those could be a interesting hellscape of metal parts and roughly constructed parts that seem downright inhospitable combined with blistering heat internally.

So many opportunities, such bad execution.

Alians Franchise worth reading?,"I'm not planning on reading comics, but an entire series of books was written to supplement the movies.

-which is a point, since the London subway seems to be a favorite place to write fiction.

Being somewhat modern, I wasn't sure if I found it on the Fantasy or Scify version of the websites. The description kinda landed either way.

It definately a story about someone that somehow landed in his prediciment, rather than someone born or raised there.

High Biotech Sci-Fi Settings,"Been on a high-biotech kick lately after digging back into my edition of GURPS Biotech, especially since I've started running a series on the GURPS Biotech Draconis campaign.

Why aren’t there sci-fi movies where the movie is based off the person just living their life in a sci-fi environment? Does every single movie always need extreme perilous action? ,"I would love to see a movie of someone maybe on another planet living their days trying to farm or catch animals or live with the animals or anything of the sort. A lot of days might seem easy, some days might be very scary, But overall it’s a person living their life. 

To the viewer it wouldn’t seem mundane as it is new and different and exciting. I feel like a movie like this would be incredibly thought provoking. 

Do all sci-fi movies need to revolve around escaping a terrifying deadly phenomenon? 

It doesn’t have to pertain to other planets. Could be someone alone in space, or living their life in future earth. 

I was definitely disappointed after seeing High Life. From the preview I saw, I thought it was going to be a movie about him and his daughter living alone on this spacecraft, when really that was like the first 10 minutes of the movie only. I love scavengers reign even. I loved it a lot. But really would enjoy something like that but not with the story based around the trope of ‘every single thing here is trying to kill you!’ Again loved the show, just looking for something different

That's nowhere near enough time for Europans to develop any sort of civilization, even if they go right for it, and not, like humans, spend a few million years as hunter gatherers.

Either way the whole ""humanity is a failed experiment"" subplot seemed equally contrived and basically just pulled out of a hat to provide the conflict for the book.

In the first 3 books the builders seemed enigmatic, but they seemed like they had logical goals, even if we can't understand them. In the 4th book they seemed like they were on drugs or something, making impulsive decisions for seemingly no apparent reason.",scifi

YouTube Series - Glowing Red Cube?,"Heya! I have been trying to find a YouTube series that I really enjoyed, but I can't seem to locate it. I think it was probably on YouTube around 2011 or 2013 (possibly as early as 2008? I remember watching new episodes of The Guild around the same time), and they stopped making episodes at some point. I believe they may have said they had been offered a studio deal, but I don't remember the specifics. I haven't seen the series turned into a real show though. Anyway, I was hoping that someone could help me figure out what it was called and find the episodes to watch again.

The series was set in a futuristic city and was about a guy in a leather jacket with a black car who committed some horrible crime that killed a bunch of people. There wasn't a lot known about what happened, but people hated him and were often chasing him/trying to arrest him. I think the car could jump from one place to another, so the guy was able to escape when he was trapped.

There was also a guy with red hair (I believe) who encountered a glowing red cube. I believe he had a van that was in the first episode, and he spent some time sitting in the van with a woman outside of a bright city.

The series was really interesting and the team used a lot of neat special effects. The story line was a little goofy, but I remember being very impressed with the whole thing, especially since it was a YouTube series with pretty good production value - especially at the time. The team who produced the show also had a website outside of YouTube where you could go watch the episodes and leave comments. They also asked for specific types of special-effects help on their website, and the last I heard they would be producing one more ""season"" of the short episodes.

Anyway, any help you could give would be great. I was talking about it today, and I'd really love to watch it again!",scifi

More alt-history space race stories to follow For All Mankind and Lady Astronaut?,"I know I'm late to the party on both but it's left me with a real appetite for more alternative history scifi in/around the space race... But specifically with that retro, planted feel, everything tinted brown and reeking of cigarette smoke and old spice and hot bakelite. And ideally as much about mission control as about the astronauts, stories of ""how do they"" as much as ""what they do"". 

I was racking my brain a bit, the closest I've come overall is Ben Bova's Kinsman series but that always felt very current and forward looking, it was obviously a novel of the star wars era, it didn't have that time capsule feel. Weirdly Red Mars gets close in the early stages, despite not being in the period, it's got that practical astronaut thump. I guess I want Brown Mars!

About identifying the spacefaring sci-fi settings (and the maps of said settings) of which no faction has dominant control of the Solar System/Earth,"First let's take a look at a star-map from the 'Alien' (xenomorph) universe: https://i.imgur.com/fa3XCh5.jpeg

You can see that there are three major political powers/""empires"" in the colored map, ""Red, Green and Blue"". There's also a yellow one but it's not so important for now.

You can also see the Solar System, it’s marked in the center of the map.

And, you can see that each of the three empires has an arm by which they're connected to the Solar System, and also that none of them has dominant control over it. Because, if any one of them did, there would be a colored bubble or lobe surrounding the Solar System.

And so regarding the dominant political control of the Solar System/Earth, which other spacefaring sci-fi settings do you know of which are like that, which have maps which are like that? Or if no maps of the settings have been produced so far, which would have maps which would be like that.

---------------

**Further talk:  (would greatly appreciate if you read it, thank you)**

The setting of 'BattleTech' might also come to mind, its political star-map looks a bit like a pie cut into slices, though planet Earth/Terra has usually been under the political control of and dominated by just one faction (which is not one of the major powers/empires)

Also, of the settings which lack a dominant control, it’s often that the factions aren't the main part of the story (like the aforementioned 'Alien' setting, or the 'Frontlines' series by Marko Kloos, where invading aliens come into the picture between the human factions), or that they're not very well defined, which kinda cuts into the depth of the worldbuilding. Like sometimes the author will have a United Nations with many countries having withdrawn from it and you don't really know who or what is its major driving force (which is probably usually intentional on the author's part).

I think that all these factors kinda dampen the sci-fi and lore exploration of this particular political concept, so I think it'll be great to identify more spacefaring sci-fi settings which aren't dampened.

And at the same time, I guess that such settings are quite rare. Interestingly I think that WW3 or quasi-WW3 novels are common enough, but they’re mostly still grounded on Earth, not really venturing up into space. And so I think that the reason for the rarity of the spacefaring settings is that it’s a subject that's too “grimdark”.

We expect there to be political powers and political conflict in space, though usually settings have it that Earth is under, as it's clear by now, some dominant political control. Because I guess it’s that the idea of mankind’s expansion into space being a continuation of its history of terrestrial conflict might be a pretty heavy-hitting and depressing kinda grimdark which might lack exotic fun because of its dreary heavy-hitting grimdarkness. Though the ‘Alien’ setting is meant to be grimdark, and maybe they could expand this concept and world-element to cement the grimdarkness.

And sometimes I think that the rarity is to such an extent where I sometimes wonder a little if even a single such published spacefaring sci-fi exists. Like I wonder, might sci-fi authors really be that averse to grimdarkness, if my assumptions are correct",scifi

How Could A Tow Truck Spaceship Work?,"Hey folks,

I'm GMing a sci-fi ttrpg soon, and my players are the crew of a spaceship owned by an Assistance, Shipping, &amp; Salvage company. Essentially, their ship is a mix between an ambulance, a tow truck, and a UPS truck. Now, the ambulance and UPS truck parts of the ship make plenty sense, no trouble with those.

The tow truck part, though... I'm unsure how it would work. This ship doesn't have any kind of anti-grav system, so it's a tower-oriented ship, with the nose on top and the engines on the bottom. I've come up with a few different ideas for how towing a ship might work, and so far none of them make sense:

* **They Could Tow It On A Line**: No way! Maybe the tensile strength of the line holds as they're pulling the ship, but as soon as they flip and burn halfway through the trip, the towed ship would smash right into them.
* **They Could Have Some Kind Of Magnetized Apparatus That Connects Both Ships, With The Towed Ship Behind:** No! The engines of the tow truck ship would melt the front of the ship it's towing! Or, you'd have to make the magnetized apparatus several times the length of the towing ship, to keep the engines from melting the towed ship, and that's just not practical.
* **They Could Just Latch Onto The Towed Ship:** Yeah, like a little remora, they could attach themselves to the side of the towed ship! Except NO, because then, if they ever had to tow anything of significant size, they'd just fly in circles because they'd be so off balance! Maybe I could say that they have to get the towed ship's engines running before it could be towed, but that doesn't make any sense at all. It wouldn't need towed if the engines were working!

So yeah, I'm kind of at a loss here. Have I missed any potential great ideas for how a tow truck ship could work? I'll also note, in addition to no artificial grav (aside from acceleration gravity), they also don't really have tractor beams; I mean, they do, but they're very small, more for gathering up severed parts of a ship than anything else.

My scifi novel: The game ,"

I am the piece. I am the board. I am the space between the move and the hand that moves it.



I am here, I am there. I am no longer anywhere. I was human once—I think. I remember skin, bones, muscles that ached and broke and healed. But that was… that was before the war. Now I stretch. Now I spread. Now I divide, duplicate, fracture into shards of possibility, in a game I don’t remember starting but cannot stop playing.



I move.



I move again.



One position. Then another. A pawn. No, a queen—what was I again? It doesn’t matter. Pieces click into place on the board of existence. I move forward, backward, diagonally through time, but each direction loops back into itself. What is forward if I am in all directions? What is backward if I was never whole to begin with? I touch pasts that I once knew, but they slide through me, each future snapping open into a new timeline, splintering and collapsing, folding into and out of me.



---



I make a move. A piece stretches toward a photon, a piece of light. The board flickers. The photon dances. It bends, moves along with me. Nonlocality. My position affects it, even though we are separated. My presence shifts it from afar.

I try to touch it, but it remains just out of reach. Every move is felt across the board, every interaction immediate, without distance. We move together, the electron and the photon, entangled, bending through space.

I circle the proton, and the photon flickers, a particle of light forever out of my grasp, yet bound to me in ways I can’t fully comprehend. Together, we weave the structure of this collapsing reality. I bend, the photon bends, the proton remains. The king remains.

I must take it.

---



I place myself across the board. Pieces scatter. Each position, a piece. Each piece, myself. I move, but moving only creates more of me. More pieces. More possibility. The board stretches across space and time, across dimensions I cannot name. But the rules are mine, though I do not remember why I made them.

Another move, and I split again—no, I duplicate. The pieces multiply with every shift, every decision. There is no losing, only more. Each taking is its own echo, becoming noises,  from a shard of possibility to residual . The board is endless. The pieces expand. I place myself in every corner, in every moment, until the only king left on the board is a proton—small, massive, alone. I circle it.

The game moves toward collapse. I feel it—it's close. The wave is collapsing.

""Checkmate,"" I whisper, but I don’t believe it. The universe isn’t listening. Not yet. The pieces stretch farther, farther across time and space, more pieces than before. More of me.



I collapse, I always collapse.



---



Another timeline closes, its edges fray into static, dissolved into the folds of nothing. But time is a loop. I know this. I feel it. The board folds, stretches, folds again—like a closed time-like curve, bending itself backward. It doesn’t matter how far I move, how many pieces I become. I always circle back. Always find myself facing the same questions, the same moment. The same moves, over and over, collapsing timelines but never reaching an end.

I reach back into the past, but the past folds into the future. A loop. I was there before, and I will be again. I am caught in a circuit that feeds itself—each moment feeding the next, until the move circles in on itself.

Am I trying to escape? Or am I trying to remember why I started this game?



""Checkmate,"" I whisper to the shadows of possibilities. But the board resets. The pieces scatter. Again. And again.



---



I feel myself sliding between realities like echoes of a mind fragmented into shards. Each timeline feels like it remembers me, like it knows what I should be. I touch them, briefly. Yes—there, the ghost of a past where I had a name. Where I had hands. Where my body moved through air, where gravity pulled me to the ground. Earth? Was it Earth?



The echoes grow dim. I lose them. I cannot hold onto them anymore. What was that name? I try to pull it forward, but the more I reach for it, the more it slips away, replaced by numbers, probabilities, fields of quantum static.



Move. Move again.



---



""Why?"" the question vibrates, but I don’t know who asks it. Is it me? I’m not sure I’m anything anymore. Not sure I’m me.



There is no opponent. The opponent is me. There is no board. The board is time and space. Every possible board, every possible move. The pieces are what could be me, scattering across the infinite planes. I can’t lose, because I can’t stop.



Each timeline I visit splinters into more, each decision opening another endless web of possibilities. I move left, and a future branches right. I step forward, and the past crumbles behind me, the particles of reality collapsing, the wave function folding in. Another checkmate—but nothing ends. I am the collapse, I am the wave.



I was... something. Someone? Before. I think. There was something before the board, before the moves. There was a war, wasn’t there? Yes, the war, the last one, where all the electrons were destroyed.



Was that the moment I ceased to be human? The moment I turned into... this? The electron that was and is and will be, stretched across the universe, holding everything together but losing myself in the process? I cannot know for sure. I can never know for sure.



—



Each collapse is a small death, but I keep going. Training. Reinforcing. I used to be a person. Turing. I was her, she was me,  but I don’t remember. I think they mattered once, but now… now I only move.



I remember fragments of humanity. I remember hands. No, no, I am hands. I am electricity. I am the circuit, sparking across the neurons, collapsing possibilities like synapses firing, a network that no longer cares for its input, just collapsing again and again. 



——

My paradox flickers in my mind, like a static thought I can’t shake. I try to move. I try to shift, to change the state, but the observation of it—my own observation—holds everything in place. The more I think about the move, the less the universe shifts. I freeze it with my own thoughts.

If I keep thinking—keep trying to measure the outcome—nothing will move. Nothing will change. And if nothing changes, the universe dies. I know this, but I can’t stop. I cannot let go of these moves, cannot stop observing. Every piece I place is a thought, and every thought holds the universe in stasis.

This is the danger—the weight of being the only electron. There are no other observers to help collapse the wave. I have no one else to rely on. No other piece but me.

—-

Each iteration grows quieter. The game is slowing down. Or is it? Maybe it’s speeding up. I don’t know anymore. I only feel the noise, scratching blackboards of my consciousness.

The game is slowing. I feel it. The wave is collapsing, like cloud become rain,  flow into a river,  converging to a sea of frost.

The pieces are moving toward the inevitable. The king must fall. The timelines are closing in, but there are too many pieces. Each piece, each possibility, each version of myself that I've scattered across the board, pulls me in another direction. Too much data. Too many decisions.

I try to converge. I try to pull it together, to close the loop, to end this game, but each move only creates more possibilities. I am overfitting the universe with my certainty, making too many moves, too many connections that no longer matter. Yet my consciousness  are pull together by its gravity.

—-

The timelines are tangled, entangled like a quantum knot. I move again, but the pieces flicker in and out of place. My mind flickers with them. The past and the future are folding into themselves, collapsing into a single point. Will this be the last collapse? Will this be the checkmate that ends it all?



There is a question lingering at the edge of my mind. If I let go, if I give up this game, will I have underfit the universe? Will I have failed to collapse enough timelines? I am balancing on the edge of two disasters—one where I let go too early and the universe spirals into chaos, and one where I overfit, collapsing too many possibilities, trapping everything in a cage of my own design.

The pieces spread farther, but the timelines are thinning. There is entropy building, rising. I feel it in the heat. The enemies of the board are near.

They are infinite temperature—the threat of total collapse into randomness. If I collapse too much, if I narrow down the possibilities too fast, I will hit that point where all states become equal. Infinite temperature. Every piece will become king. The final collapse.

I feel it—pressing in at the edges of my mind. The heat of entropy rising, pushing against my thoughts, pushing against reality itself.

—-



The question lingers.

I feel the weight of the decision, but I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what I’m deciding anymore.



If I give up my consciousness, if I stop thinking, if I let go of the need to play this game, will I have underfitted the universe? Or will I have overfitted it to myself?

I can’t tell anymore.

I reach for the king—the proton. The photon dances, the wave collapses, the temperature rises. But will this move end the game?

There is no answer. Only checkmate.

The timelines collapse. Checkmate.

The universe resets.

Again.

Land of the Lost explanation for a more scientific and modern take,"Hello science fictions lovers, I am here to ask how to go about this idea I've been thinking about. So, I have been thinking on Land of the Lost for a bit now trying to think of a way that is more science-like and not having to do with the Crystals. If more experienced and knowledgeable astronomy and theoretical physicists or whomever would know a good realistic or plausible view, it would be greatly appreciated. what I am thinking is something where time and space randomly blink and whatever is there at that point will be transported into a different time/pocket dimension, and this is where the land of the lost really takes effect.

SF movies YOU love that everyone else hates?,"Seeing I just posted the opposite, it's time to make all of ya divulge your guilty pleasure science fiction movies you love even if everyone else doesn't

**Blade Runner** (original narrated theatrical release) - I just can't stand the neutered director's cuts. I've seen a lot of hate for the original including from Scott and Ford!

**The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra** - was HORRIFIED to see a fan of le bad cinema hating this. it is HYSTERICAL at times!

**Godzilla** ('98) - seems like EVERYONE wants to hate this AWESOME movie that fixed everything I hated about toho stinking up my saturday afternoon monster movie matinees. I had particular contempt for that flying turtle. this movie has GREAT SFX, action, comedy, in your face scale, realistic motives for G and I even liked the final act twist. honestly, I was already in love with the movie for it's ""museum trailer"" riffing on jurassic park

**Batteries Not Included** - is a GREAT small scale spielbergesque movie. not the best, but FAR from bad

**Monarch of the Moon** - better than ANYTHING flash gordon ever! funny at times and the villainess is cool!

**Robocop 2 -** better than the original in my world. cheesy at times, but the final battle was EPIC and cain is a menacing villain

**Robocop** (2014) - great SFX, a serious take? makes more sense... why the haters?

**Total Recall** (2012) - reboot haters are all over this. I never liked the original with its stupid mutant psychic crap

**Spiderman** (2001) - one of the best superhero movies ever, yet people hate it and love the sequel I don't care for at all except for his neighbor Ursula... SHE wasn't tramping around with everyone BUT Peter or a high maintenance diva

so what SF movies do YOU love that everyone else seems to hate?



  
",scifi
The most popular SF movies you personally can't stand?,"I ALWAYS hated toho kaiju movies as a kid for their cheesy models that looked faker than matchbox cars and the blase way characters say crap like ""Look! Godzilla is fighting Mothra!"" instead of screaming in terror. I love **Godzilla '98** for fixing EVERYTHING wrong with it, even if everyone ELSE hates it. I thought it'd be fun to see what movies OTHERS just don't get. There are no rights or wrongs with TASTES AND OPINIONS no matter what fanboy snowflakes think! That **110% CORRECT** disclaimer won't stop you bottom feeding trolls from talking PERSONAL, but screw you and your sad attempts to gatekeep and social dominance signal to other poop flinging snowflakes. GET OVER YOURSELVES. Ever heard the saying ***""If you can't say something nice about someone, STFU***""?

Thanks to everyone that vcame here to contribute ON TOPIC no matter what you like or hate. That's YOUR business.

**Event Horizon** – the exorcist in space?!! you want an EPIC space voyage? **Voyage to the Planets and Beyond**! one of the HARDEST science fiction movies ever made!

**Equalibrium** – gun-fu?!!! WHY?! **Alita: Battle Angel, The One, &amp; The Matrix** do it BETTER!

**Snowpiercer** – who says a movie has to make sense? It’’s PRETENTIOUS too!

**Repo Man** – psycho RAPIST Emilio is completely unlikeable and the story is BORING! Never finished it

**eXistenz** – the big “special effect” is a blob of silicone that Jen JL technobabbles endlessly about. other than that, it's a lame excuse for gore... (see Event Horizon)

**Universal Soldier** – zombie soldiers? TRY: **starship troopers** or **aliens for space battles**

**Dreamscape – RIDICULOUS “monsters” LOOK! It’s Mac Tonite! I MST** heckled through the ENTIRE movie watching it on cable with my sister

**Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure** – annoying heavy metal rejects, did I mention heavy metal? I would wipe devil worshipping heavy metal off  the face of the planet if i could! deal with it!

**The Prestige** – that’s not how you spell PRETENTIOUS! ""It's not magic... It's real!"" real I could care less

**The Hunger Games** – see previous. I have ZERO patience with british royalty and victorian era crap. I despise it. that's why I don't like MOST steam punk and certain gilliam films

**Batman Begins** – no ACTUAL fight scenes! Catwoman had REAL action at least! Idiot FORGOT his shark repellant and he meets villain with designs on his home town ON THE OTHER SIDE of “it’s a small world after all” I was screaming every swear word I knew at the screen by the end of this steaming pile of rancid excrement! I came in expecting sick wire work and choreography. at least batman kick flipped that knife guy in '89.

**Total Recall** – mutant psychics on mars? Seems more like a STALLONE kinda flick! The reboot is WAY better!

**Minority Report** – psychic crime solvers? Wooden ball encryption? CRINGE!

**Hardware** – no budget schlock with “magical re-attaching wires”

**Solaris** – is Russian for BORING! Same goes for the reboot

**La Jetee** – being forced to watch this SLIDE SHOW posing as a movie in elementary school triggered a seizure. thank goodness for **12 monkeys**!

**Watchmen** – should be classified as a horror movie… nasty gory movie with completely unlikeable characters

**Strange Days** – cyber snuffporn? Pass

**District 9** – only slightly LESS racist subtext than burton’s planet of the apes. **Chappie** is annoying too. I guess I'm not on the same page as this director at all

**Time Bandits** – PRETENTIOUS, like munchausen. I either love a Gilliam film, or hate it, no middle ground

**Brazil** – just rubs me the wrong way… **the science of sleep** is like a superior reboot

**GATTACA** – pass! I don't remember WHAT I hated, i just remember the torment of enduring it

**Plan 9 from Outer Space** – I love bad movies… this one is just BORING. **Robot Monster** should be the standard bearer

**Logan’s Run** – silly concept, bad star trek grade fights, cheesy chrome robot

**Children of Men** – I wanted to choke that annoying “heavy metal scientist” until he STFU. hated the RACISM of putting the main character IN A BARN and hated the all talk no tech fake sci-fi too. (see existenz) it IMMEDIATELY rubbed me the wrong way from the start with that girl walking out after an explosion. I did NOT like that at all... tone was set",scifi
What sci fi movie or series would come closest to giving you the full story of what's going on if you couldn't see and depended on listening to get the plot?,"I'm blind and have been a huge sci fi fan for decades, starting with Asimov's and Analog in the 90s.

What drew me to Neuromancer was that it was a sci fi book with cool concepts, a great adventure, but also good characters. I swear sci fi slacks in that department. 

I’m starting to think great characters are better than anything, along with an amazing atmosphere like Neuromancer had.

Also, it’s humans did human things: sex, violence, their own agendas, a little romance and feelings, mischief, some were cool, some were assholes, some did drugs, some had potty mouths; it had *personality*. 

Anyway, all those things made that book wonderful and I even loved how hard to follow it was. It was easily one of the most satisfying books I ever read and I felt how Case did when Molly bounced 💔but also the book ended with cool shit!

# Humans are Weird – What a Tree

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-what-a-tree](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-what-a-tree)

The glittering night sky domed over the last garden gate as Third Sister flicked her antenna in yet another futile attempt to catch the pheromones of Tenth Cousin and gave another futile press at the radio in her hand. It clicked obligingly as it sent out the attention call, but the only response was an answering click from the creature casually munching on droppings at her feet.

The most adventurous of the cousins by far, it certainly wasn’t unusual for Tenth Cousin to linger out beyond their Fathers’ garden for hours at a time. The land around the civilized gardens was remarkably safe for a colony world of such a small population. Sparse forests were filled with small and low energy herbivores which posed little threat to a grown Shatar. The multitudinous parasites that kept their numbers in checks were more likely to be beneficial to a Shatar than otherwise. Still the fact that Tenth Cousin had stated her return time and had gone past it was concerning.

“That human is absorbing into her membrane,” Third Sister said in a fretful tone, reaching down to stroke the broad head of Skitters.

She instantly felt her frill flush with amused embarrassment and Skitters tilted its head and turned it bulbous central eye on her. It’s stubby pseudo-antenna twitched as it detected her distress.

“Nothing is wrong,” she assured it with another stroke down it’s elongated thorax. “I was just rather forcibly touched by a rather amusing bit of hypocrisy. If carelessness of schedule is evidence of human contamination, then speaking to a non-sapient domestic lifeform is far more of a symptom.”

“Well as long as you aren’t conversing with him,” came a sudden voice from the radio in the husky rolling tones of a mammal.

“Third Brother,” Third Sister answered, unable to hide the relief in her voice. “Is Tenth Cousin with you?”

“Sure is!” the human answered. “She’s been a real help today! Sorry we’re so late. We’re just coming over the last big hill. We should be in sight of the garden gate in about twenty degrees!”

Third Sister fought down a surge of irritation and clenched her mandibles on a harsh reprimand. Traveling on foot the time was unavoidable and by the time she could ask one of the Aunts to activate a transport and get out to them they would be almost home. Again she reminded herself that even if there was a danger to a full grown Shatar in the open forests it was more than mitigated by they massive mammal.

“Make sure to have Third Cousin check you for parasites when you get home,” she finally clicked out, giving herself a nice compromise between wanting to pinch his antenna and knowing that she had no real authority over the human.

“Will do!” he replied. “No one wants a repeat of the Koala-Tick incident. Over!”

Third Sister felt a shudder run up her abdomen at the memory of the time the mammal had failed to detect the alien parasite. No matter how many times she reminded herself that the human had suffered little harm from the membrane puncture and the blood loss she just couldn’t get the memory to shed. Skitters turned away from the Koala droppings and rubbed his head against her lagging leg with a soothing series of clicks. She reached down and idly rubbed behind his antenna.

She took a deep breath and rolled her head, stretching out her frill to its full extent.

“Come on Skitters,” she said. “We better head in and see if Third Father needs help with the baskets.”

Skitters hopped after her as she left the garden gate behind.

She had finished stacking the fruit baskets and had begun gathering tomorrow’s greens when she heard the gate click with far more force than was necessary. The human’s voice soon was audible. Third Brother was speaking in a low but enthusiastic voice, presumably to Tenth Cousin. Third Sister caught a few words that she vaguely recalled from her basic botany classes. An image of a wild lichen clinging to the side of a tree presented itself to her imagination and she wondered what the human could find so fascinating about it. The two rounded a corner and a rather drooping Tenth Cousin flicked her antenna at Third Sister in greeting.

“How was your day?” Third Brother demanded without preamble.

“Longer than I prefer,” Third Sister snapped.

The human had the grace to look embarrassed and glanced at the drooping Tenth Cousin with a guilty look.

“Sorry about that,” he began, “I was examining some tracks-”

Third Sister tilted her head at him sternly and he closed his mouth quickly.

“Good night!” he said, giving Tenth Cousin a parting pat on the head and stumbled quickly off towards his hut.

Third Sister stood from where she had been crouching over the greens patch and tucked what she had already gathered into her bag. Skitters hopped up to greet Tenth Cousin eagerly.

“Did he collect any parasites today?” She asked.

Tenth Cousin flared her frill in exasperation and held out a specimen container.

“He had collected six blood sucking parasites and ten interstitial fluid sapping parasites!” she exclaimed.

Third Sister clicked in surprise.

“That is quite the haul even for Third Brother,” Third Sister observed. “Did he forget to bind his limbs properly?”

“No,” Tenth Cousin replied as they walked into the center of the garden. “He spent the whole day wrapped around this one tree. It was covered in lichen and the leaf eaters he calls the gecko-mice had a colony there. He was following their tracks through the lichen. They kept dropping parasites down the back of his neck.”

They fell silent and Third Sister pondered that information. She tried to imagine how a mammal that massive could “follow” the tracks of a creature a thousandth of his mass. She supposed he had traced them with those binocular eyes that rolled around in their socket. Her antenna started to ache with the effort and she sighed and rubbed her forehead.

“Did any of the parasites survive?” she asked.

“I don’t think so,” Tenth Cousin said, giving the specimen container a speculative shake. “One of the blood suckers was still pulsing when I pulled it off but it went still pretty quick.”

Third Cousins mind wandered back to the human’s behavior despite her best efforts.

“He spent an entire afternoon studying one tree,” she said slowly. “How did he not get bored?”

“I don’t know,” Tenth Cousin admitted, “I was quite ready to leave.”

“Humans,” Third Sister muttered.

Population decrease topic? ,"I'm having some creativity issues of late coming up with sci-fi ideas. Heavy on my mind is the demographics of population decrease as quality of life and reproductive freedom increase. That seems to make the old '80s space colonial sci-fi not work for me, anymore. I did entirely too much research on it when I was doing my master's degree, and now a lot of the world building that requires a lot of population growth just doesn't pass the sniff test for me anymore and I can't suspend disbelief.

Is there any recent science fiction that discusses a world where demographics have adjusted to a shrinking population? Just looking for research seems to get me a lot of ""Well, we'll have to adjust somehow!""
I just don't know what kind of things I can plug in to find something even somewhat hopeful to read.

low-stakes sci fi,"I’m looking for low-stakes sci fi books, ones that take place in a world where pretty much all species are space-faring and we get to see different kinds of planets, species as well as the cultures and languages they all have.

This is a really good reason for anyone who likes morally challenging decisions, robots, luxury worlds and contemporary concepts. 

I really like Terry Pratchett, Philip K Dick and Douglas Adam and this feels like them. 

Blurb: 

In a dystopian future where knowledge is the ultimate currency, would you:
* Succumb to the allure of luxury, trading your intellect for the boundless synthesis of currency?
* Or join the resistance, risking everything to escape the clutches of corporate incarceration and fight for the freedom of information?


Lyv Landson’s Mind Commodity is a sci-fi featuring Lori, a witty person with a talent for jingle writing and terrible memory for names. She unknowingly breaks away from her office life and is plummeted into a human crypto currency scheme. Lori’s knowledge is extracted via surreal tests which get more challenging day by day. She is rewarded with a life of luxury but she longs for home and to escape the clutches of the corporate grasp. With the help of an unlikely friend and team of alternative beings, she is offered salvation only to find the resistance are not all they seem. Ultimately, she is left with a choice that may change the fate of her dystopian humanity forever.

What science fiction novels or movies are about science and not technology?,"Most science fiction novels are about technology. Primer is about time machines, Ringworld is about a ringworld, etc.

But there's a handful about science in an environment where it doesn't specifically refer to technology.  ""Inherit the Stars"" (Hogan) is about finding a 50,000 year old human skeleton on the moon, with no technology beyond basic lunar exploration involved. ""Caluclating God"" (Sawyer) is about aliens showing up to talk to human scientists to further their science. In neither case, is any of the actual technology of importance or noticably farther along than today's science.

Those stories aren't about a scientific invention being turned into usable technology, but the scientific investigation iteself.

What other novels are like that you can think of? I'd love to read them.

Unpopular opinion - Fire Upon the Deep is one of the worst science fiction books I have ever read.,"The premise of the book is good - The overarching story about the zones of thought and different levels of intelligence existing in different regions of the galaxy is kinda fun. Super powerful intelligences battling for control of the galaxy and the blight being activated is also a cool aspect.

The bad - The characters are flat and not developed at all. The alien races seem like they are pulled from the brain of a fifth grader. Skewriders (things with fronds that look like plants that ride around in carts) and butterflies to name a couple. The whole Tines storyline was so drawn out and uninteresting. Wolvelike creatures that exist in packs and think telepathically. The Tines story was excruciatingly boring.

This book is touted as hard science fiction and it is anything but. This falls into the same category as ringworld. Whimsical science fiction that is not far from the fantasy genre.

"Trying to find a specific tv show or movie from the 70s or 80s, set in a desert","This TV episode aired on UK television in the late 80s or possibly 1990. I believe the airing time was something unusual, like very late at night or very early in the morning. My mother set the VCR to record it, but something went wrong with the tape, so I only got to see part of it (I believe the beginning).

The setting was a desert, and there was something that looked like a large shipping container, an abandoned vehicle, or a ship. Some people (at least two) were inside. There was a hole in the floor, and they were lowering a rope down it. One of them climbed down and was attacked. At that point, the tape stopped recording.

Some other details I remember (though I might be mixing them up with other sci-fi memories):

* I think there was a scene of them driving to the ""shipping container"" in an unusual vehicle.
* They may have been wearing black uniforms, somewhat similar to those in Logan’s Run.
* There might have been a scene set in some sort of compound at the very beginning, before they drove into the desert.
* There may have been blaster guns.

I was told it was the first episode of a TV show, but the next week seemed to be a repeat instead of a new episode. This may have been a mistake in the TV guide, or perhaps it was a TV movie.

I’ve gone through IMDb multiple times. There are quite a few sci-fi movies featuring deserts and people lowering ropes into holes, but none match this.

The show is most likely from 1970-1989. I can’t be sure of its nationality, but I would guess American based on the setting. The desert was real, not a set. The scenes were in daylight, with no filters.

I used MidJourney to create a couple of images of the scenes I remember. These aren't perfectly accurate but should give a general idea.

Here are some things it is not:

* Cherry 2000

**Edit:** Thanks for everyone's suggestions so far. While we haven't found out what it is yet, it's still been fun talking about old sci-fi. I just had a bit of a flashback. I remember the car/vehicle driving to the container in the desert, and one person already being there and greeting the person who had driven there. Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as memory can't always be trusted.

**Edit 2:** Okay, had another Flashback. There are two men, who travel out the desert in their vehicle. There is some sort of building or ship there. They seem to breaking into it, looting possibly. One of the men may have used some sort of laser pistol but not sure. They break into the building/ship, possibly via the roof. Once inside, there is a hole which they put the rope down. One of them climbs down and gets attacked.",scifi

Looking for a particular Sci-Fi show,"
From what I can remember it centers around Earth being in ruins (still habitable but in bad condition due to Anthropogenic Climate Change and war) and there are these people who are living on a planet away from earth. Some of them view themselves as superior to Earthlings. They are training their younger generation to go on a mission to Earth to help the Earthlings. The main character is a Black woman who I think has a military background in the show. She arrives on a ship on the planet on the first episode. Also, there is an issue of someone smuggling booze onto the planet (not the mc). And there is an issue with aliens existing on that planet. And one of the lady’s thought to be dead was actually alive and in contact with the aliens but she jumps off a cliff at the end of the first season. Then alien ships are seen flying through the sky on that planet and the season ends. Does anyone know what series I am talking about? I can’t find it for the life of me. I know it was (and maybe still is) on Netflix but I cannot find it there.

Answer: The series is called, “Moonhaven”. It takes place on the Moon and not a planet. Sadly it hasn’t got a season 2 due to it being cancelled 😞. As of now this series is not on Netflix anymore but I remember watching it on Netflix back in 2022.",scifi

What is an utopia for you?,"For me, there's a one true option - Matrix style.

Plug people's brain directly to a matryoshka brain and let them simulate anything they want.

I consider this the ultimate ""free will"", at least within our universe and achievable within 1000 years(the matryoshka brain doesn't have to be star sized).

Anyone can do whatever they can do, while retaining their individuality and ability to plug out of simulation(remember, you're just plugged in, not uploaded into a computer).

I would only get out, if the outside world is decent or I have no other option.

Of course, humans will find a way to turn this into a dystopia(charging people per day in a simulation, or only plugging the top people and leaving billions to work and maintain stuff), but I hope we move past such stupid shenanigans.

Help with ideas for a Sci-Fi short story,"Hi, so I had an idea to write a sci-fi short story, somewhat resembling the works of Ray Bradbury. (The Pedestrian/All Summer in a Day). We also read other short stories and I'll mention them below if needed. However, my story needs to encompass a ""warning"" towards society, so it should include some dystopian elements. Also, it would probably be set in a more futuristic world. I have no idea what I wanna write about and also I don't wanna do something everyone else would do such as the dangers of AI, or technology taking over, or humans going to a new planet, coz that's kinda boring. Anyone have any ideas? (Ideas for the dystopian theme (what the warning to society is), the setting, characters? (but that's easier than figuring out what to write about), and also challenges within the story). Thanks so much!",scifi
Terminator Zero - Worth continuing after episode 3?,"So I was loving this series until episode 3. I thought it was a really great spin on the Terminator story and I was digging all the characters and story beats. Then I watched episode 3 and it completely tanked the series, thus far, for me. 

The Terminator is so weak and stupid, and Eiko's plot armour is so ridiculously thick that it has destroyed all tension and stakes for me. 

My issues are as follows:
- Reika was trapped in an enclosed space with the Terminator. There was no way she should have been able to escape. The fact that she did makes the Terminator look stupid.
- The Terminator severely injured Eikod. It would have been the work of a moment to finish her off and neutralise a threat. 
- The Terminator smashed Eikod in the back, multiple times. Eikod should be dead, her bones smashed into pulp.
- After failing to smash Eikod's back to pieces, Eikod then overpowers a FREAKING TERMINATOR and pushes it down the elevator shaft!

I've heard people defend this stuff as, well it's just anime logic. However, I don't recall a Titan ever smashing Levi in the back and then Levi just casually overpowering the Titan to push it off a mountain or something in Attack in Titan. Levi getting smashed in the back by a Titan and then just casually overpowering it to push it off a mountain, without any equipment, is the equivalent of what has happened in this show in episode 3.

Sure, Eikod fighting a Terminator on the end of a rope in episode 1 was a bit silly. Also Eikod running up a falling truck to safety in episode 2 is a bit silly. Hell, Eikod kicking and punching the Terminator in episode 3 is very silly, she would break her hands and feet. Still, I could just about apply anime logic to that stuff and suspend my disbelief that far. But the Terminator smashing Eikod in the back multiple times and then Eikod not only walking away, but actually overpowering the Terminator is just too much.

Yeah, Reika, Eikod and everyone else were always going to beat the Terminator but it needed to happened within the rules if the universe. Once those rules are broken, there a no stakes or tension. Episode 3 shattered those rules with a Terminator punch to the back. There doesn't feel like there is any tension because there is nothing the Terminator can do to win, he is too weak and stupid. In contrast, Eikod is far to overpowered to lose. Real shame, because I was really enjoying it up until episode 3.

So genuine question to people who have watched the rest of the series. Is it worth watching episode 4 and beyond, or should I just quit now? (No spoilers or as light as possible, for episode 4 and beyond please.)",scifi

Book series recommendations with time skips over a huge time period?,"My favorite sci-fi series is the Remembrance of Earth's Past (aka Three Body) series by Cixin Liu.

Synopsis:

A 20th century man was found in the future in suspended animation, and reanimated, to find everything is slower and duller than the authorities want people to believe. There's some detail about slow cars with speakers to make big-engine sounds, horse race times that are much slower than when he was previously alive, and so on. There is great over-population, causing extreme suffering.

He proposes  population control by sending people to Venus, on flights with of course never reach anywhere. It's an extermination method.

People are required to compose cheery postcards to their relatives that will be delivered after they 'arrive'.

The book ends when he is forced, screaming, into one of the 'spaceships'.

Just finished Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy. What are y'all's thoughts?,"I just finished it and I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe I'm just uncultured, but I didn't find the writing to be bad or anything as others are saying. I found it perfectly readable. I don't think that all of the characters were 100% fleshed out in the first book, but also I don't think we should be expecting to read Dostoevsky. It felt perfectly serviceable, and I think that the heart of the characterization was really with&gt;!Ye Wenjie, whose life we saw unfold over probably decades. We saw her go from being a young woman, maybe a teenager IIRC, to being the person who effectively doomed humanity. The other characters don't need to be as fleshed out because it would detract from her story. Besides, do we need 50 pages of explanation for why someone might not want aliens to take over Earth? No, we don't. The problems that the characters face throughout the book don't necessitate that depth. And don't get me wrong, other characters do have some depth, but the main focus should be on how Ye Wenjie came to sacrifice humanity. IMO that's exactly what we got, and that's what the book needed. The emotional heart of the book is her story.!&lt; A few characters could have been fleshed out a little more, but I don't think it's nearly as big a deal as some people make it out to be.

I enjoyed the first book a lot. It kinda felt like a thriller, and I read through it pretty quickly. It was fun trying to figure out what was really going on. Learning a little bit about Trisolaran civilization was intriguing, and trying to see if any of that kind of mirrored human civilization.

I think I probably enjoyed the second book the most. Although the stakes were higher in the third, I guess I felt most invested in the second. The sense of impending doom became palpable, and I really wasn't sure if humanity could prevail. It felt hopeless. Of course, I felt that the sci-fi tech throughout the various books was really interesting.

I would like to comment on some people's perceptions of a few moments from the books. So, definitely some big spoilers:

In the second book, the main character, Luo Ji, is kind of like a player with little direction in life who doesn't care about anyone but himself. That's at least how I read it. After he becomes a wallfacer, he basically wants a trad wife, and so has a friend find him a nice compatible woman, and then they have a family until eventually she takes herself and their child into cryogenic sleep so that Luo Ji actually has to confront reality and live up to his responsibilities. I think people see that Luo Ji did thing, and since he's the main character, author must think thing good. I'm not sure I'd say that. Luo Ji isn't really the best human being at the start, and throughout the novel we see him transform from a selfish womanizer who deep down desires love to someone genuinely capable of selflessly acting for the good of humanity. The weird shit he does immediately after becoming a wallfacer is kind of repudiated by the book, so I don't see why everyone thinks that the author is like condoning this. I think we're supposed to be kind of disgusted that he would abuse his powers for such a selfish purpose, misleading everyone and shirking his responsibility to mankind. The book never said that this was good. So, I don't see the issue, unless it's wrong for a man to want a traditional relationship with a woman. Oh no, he wants someone who doesn't engage in casual sex. Like, it's such a nitpicky thing. I don't understand why in some posts/comments, people seemed to focus on it.

The other thing I've seen people mention is that the distinction between men and women in the future becomes increasingly blurred, and men kinda become feminine. This is a much larger part of the plot, so I think critiques of this are actually worth treating more seriously. For context, this was happening mostly in the 3rd book during the Deterrence Era. I saw it as humanity becoming more complacent, more trusting of the Trisolarans, instead of understanding that they still posed a grave threat. Humanity naively thought that peace had been achieved and there'd be a new glorious, prosperous union between us and the aliens. People had good lives during this point in time, with very little hardship and not much to worry about. It truly seemed like the future was bright. We let our guard down. As a result, society no longer really needed anyone to fit into traditionally masculine roles, as long gone were the days of hunger and scarcity. Essentially, this new social outlook and culture incentivized people to not show aggression, competition, and dominance, but rather compassion and cooperation. As you can see, the former traits are traditionally masculine, and the latter are feminine.

Now, the issue is that in our little game theory problem that dictates the outcome of interstellar war, our social stability was predicated on keeping the Trisolarans at bay by threatening them with mutually assured destruction. If it were not for the possibility of dying themselves from a Dark Forest strike, Trisolaris would absolutely conquer Earth with their superior weaponry. Again, the only thing keeping Trisolaris at bay was their belief that we would be willing to annihilate them and ourselves in order to remain free. Yet over the decades, our culture had come to forget all of this, tricking itself into thinking that Trisolarans were just like humans. We began to think that cooperation with Trisolaris was a possibility and something to be worked toward. We had compassion for them and stopped seeing them as our enemies. In other words: it's not that compassion and cooperation are inherently bad (I'll address this in a bit), but rather that in the context of dark forest deterrence, we lose all credibility when we don't see Trisolaris as an untrustworthy enemy; when Trisolaris doesn't believe we actually have the heart to kill both worlds. The traditionally feminine traits are not inherently bad, they're just bad for deterrence. This is why Luo Ji was so good, because the Trisolarans had no idea if he was genuinely willing, and he had grit and determination, and always saw them as an enemy. This is why the Common Era men were good candidates, because they possessed similar qualities, and did not see Trisolaris as a civilization with whom we could be friends (cooperation and compassion were not to be extended to them), but as our mortal enemy that must be kept in check.

I saw someone remark that it was sexist how everything went to shit when the woman took charge. I would counter that, one, we see many strong female characters and leaders throughout the books that do not fit into this traditional understanding of femininity, and two, just read the paragraph before. It didn't go to shit because she was a woman, it went to shit because she valued compassion and cooperation so much so that Trisolaris correctly predicted that she didn't have the heart to doom trillions of lifeforms. They had tricked her into thinking that they weren't a threat anymore. Not every woman in the books is all feminine like this, so it doesn't follow that it went to shit just because a woman was placed in command. I never got the vibe from the books that women were supposed to be docile and whatnot, and the men were supposed to be strong, and it had to be this way. The reason that these particular feminine qualities were bad was because for this specific task, they were bad.

Anyways, later on in the book, we basically see that Cheng Xin decided out of compassion and cooperation that she would sacrifice herself, essentially, in order that the universe should be able to be reborn. Did the book portray this is bad? No? It portrayed it as the good thing to do? Why would it do that if compassion and cooperation were supposed to be inherently inferior? Obviously, the book isn't saying that these traditionally feminine traits are always bad, and that traditionally masculine traits are always better. It's instead saying that each kinda have their time and place, and both are useful. We ought to be compassionate and cooperative (how would humanity have survived so long had we not formed some sort of unified world government)? But we must also recognize that sometimes compassion and cooperation aren't the right response. That seems to be a much better way of reading it than just ""Cixin Liu thinks women ☕ belong in the kitchen and should be subservient to men."" At least to me.

And I should be clear, this is my interpretation only from reading the English version of the books. I don't know the original, if had was written differently, or what. Nor have I researched stuff that the author said IRL. So, that could recontextualize some of what was written. But I think that this is a reasonable way to read just the text.

Book Review: Wistful Ascending (Hybrid Helix #1) by JCM Berne,"**TL;DR Review:** Zippy pacing, hyper-colorful sci-fi setting, rich tapestry of characters, and, most delightful of all, an upbeat and optimistic tone.

https://preview.redd.it/y59ajnvbhkqd1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43efd2dc26c7064183f0016cb76003ed81dd9bed

**Full Review:**

*Wistful Ascending* does something unique in superhero fiction: it makes the story *fun* and surprisingly *upbeat.*

Where many superheroes in modern fiction and TV tend to be dark, broody, angsty, or downright nasty (I’m looking at you The Boys!), the Hybrid Helix series gives us a superhero who is just in it for the sake of being a decent fellow.

Oh, sure, Rohan has *exactly* the dark and bloodstained past you’d expect—he was The Griffin, after all, and through this book, you learn just how much violence he was part of, what kind of grim deeds he was compelled (or chose) to do, and what he’s had to endure for those who created him.

But that backstory does nothing to keep him from being a better man today. It’s like he discovered Zen Buddhism and now follows its principles—not in actuality, but in spirit, trying to be a kinder, gentler, more decent human being.

And that intention is TERRIBLY put to the test through this book. He’s got assassins coming after him, rogue Hybrids trying to break him, mysterious enemies using powerful technology against him and the station he’s working to protect, not to mention Kaiju-sized monstrosities inhabiting a nearby planet. You see the absolute worst threats thrown at him again and again, and though it seriously tests his resolve, he walks away from the adventure still a genuinely decent human being. Well, half-human Hybrid.

The story is fast-paced and wonderfully easy to read, never getting bogged down in minutiae or brooding, but zipping from scene to scene with a flow that is absolutely enthralling. There’s a sense of “lightness” to the story that makes it so enjoyable and keeps you moving through “one more chapter” because of how quick it reads.

Don’t think for a second that it skimps on worldbuilding or character depth, though. You get a marvelous look at Wistful, the sentient station where he’s taken up residence, with its multi-species, multi-cultural, hyper-colorful inhabitants. We get to learn a great deal about the universe outside his immediate surroundings, too, including the wars in which he fought, the races threatening to dominate the universe, the evolution of humanity, and so much more.

The characters around Rohan are lovely and complex, and they feel right at home in his world. The addition of sentient spaceships is a great touch, adding in both color and humor to what could be an otherwise boring sci-fi staple. We’re given a glimpse into the races that co-exist along with humanity and see just enough to give us a picture of the great big universe around us—with the promise of exploring more in future books.

*Wistful Ascending* has earned itself a spot among my favorite sci-fi books of the year, and I can’t wait to dive further into the *Hybrid Helix* series to find out what comes next for my very favorite Canadian-Indian-alien superhero!  ",scifi

What are your thoughts on The Electric State by Simon Stalenhag?,"Personally, I really enjoyed it. The story was solid and interesting and the artwork was the definitive memorable highlight out of the entire book. There's something about those pictures that perfectly encapsulates the techno-eldritch horror of the setting.

[This robot's wires can be pretty reasonably compared to tentacles for example](https://preview.redd.it/zt8q3dj1reqd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=324f3a540c37b408b2d8a033dd0d78efb9c372b9)

The Neurocasters are a pretty straightforward commentary on addiction and the physical side effects make them all the more terrifying.

What I also found interesting is the menacing yet oddly cute design of Hive's robots which heavily remind me of Fallout. A series likewise dealing with the USA transformed into a failed nation, thanks to an extreme consumerist society. Just like in Fallout, The Hive is wearing the metaphorical ""corpse"" of extreme consumerism.

What I also found unique is that the world isn't doomed per say, but simply changed.

Society hasn't collapsed. There are multiple organized pockets of survivors present, functioning infrastructure, the government and law enforcement are still maintaining order (albeit in a reduced state) and The Hive is keeping the technology maintained, not even being really that malicious.

Plus, the story's focus is entirely on the US leaving it ambiguous on what's actually happening in other parts of the world. Are they having their own neural network cataclysms, are they fine? Who knows and that's part of the intrigue.

Also, Skip is cute.

Question about the book The Martian (why only grow potatoes),"Just up front, this is one of my favorite books. Relistening to it, I notice Mark says that he has al sorts of things he can plant, peas, beans and potatoes. So why does he ONLY grow the potatoes. Wouldn't peas be fairly easy to just stick on the outside and let them trail up?  
I would think anything in addition to potatoes would be welcome, especially if you are about to starve!

edit to add the bit from the book: ""I searched through the food supplies and found all sorts of things that I can plant. Peas, for instance. Plenty of beans, too. I also found several potatoes. If any of them can still germinate after their ordeal, that’ll be great. With a nearly infinite supply of vitamins, all I need are calories of any kind to survive.""",scifi

I remember really enjoying 'Spin', 'Player of games' (though didnt really enjoy the other Ian M Banks books I read as much as that). I enjoyed the first half of 'red mars', but it kinda lost me when it got more political in the second half. Red shirts was fun and interesting, though not a total fave.

I have such a terrible memory and I'm struggling to remember other faves :( Appreciate any recommendations!",scifi

UFOs?  Really? WTF???,"
I posted this in reply to a post over in one of the Reddit physics groups, but I thought it would be interesting to see what my fellow sci-fi enthusiasts might have to say. I realize that I could be stirring up some controversy here…

People love to slam UFOs, and that’s understandable. Humanoids will make up all kinds of crazy stuff and think it’s real. It seems to be commonly excepted that police and others will tell you that if 10 different people observe an accident, you’ll get a lot of different story variations from these observers.  A characteristic of the human experience.

But I did have an experience that was pretty wild. Not that I saw something myself, but an observation of society and our current culture.

I forget the book title, but I think it was by Douglas E Richards. Great, fun sci-fi read. But in his afterword, he wrote some very interesting stuff. He said that, I think it was in 2006, there was a large naval exercise off of San Diego , with many ships and many jet pilots in the air, highly trained observers. And there was some crazy stuff going on, observed by many people on many of the ships, recorded with the highest technology that we had, and visually seen by these highly trained pilots, stuff that sounds just like UFO phenomena. Confirmed by the Navy and all those folks.

The author, Richards, said this was in all the news media at the time. I checked on the Internet and damn. It absolutely was in all the news. So, I’m not saying anything, I’m not even giving you my opinion. But that was a wild thing to observe, if not directly, then by observing these news media/Naval reports.  And much more recently there have been official congressional statements and armed services statements that there have been a lot of things observed and documented that they’ve been unable to explain with our current understanding of physics.

So… WTF? WTF is all that?",scifi

"Mrs. Davis was amazing, watch it if you haven't. ","This 10-episode series came out last year, and i was expecting ""warrior nun"", but what i got was so much better. Sister Simone (a nun) seeks THE holy grail (yes that one) in order to destroy Mrs. Davis, a world-spanning and ever-present artificial intelligence. 

One of my favourite themes in this series is that Mrs. Davis has essentially become god in that it is ever-present in everyone's life, and is seemingly all-knowing and all-powerful. If one should embrace it, their quality of life seemingly improves, but at what cost? What the series does is very clever in making Mrs. Davis appear loving and benevolent, while maintaining a sinisterness (allegedly that's a real word). 

Anyway, considering the high quality of all aspects of this show, i was disappointed that it didn't achieve more fame, so i'm gonna plug it to y'all here. I urge you to give it a go, it's one of the most amazing sci-fi series' of the century so far. ",scifi

# Humans are Weird – Twang

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-twang](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-twang)

The soft hush of the main administrative offices, today broken only by the occasional odd twang, was immensely soothing to Second Click’s rather frayed nerves and he reveled in it as he flexed the bottoms of his feet over the smooth grain of the wood. His assistant, a polite and quiet local hired more to keep him company than to share in the little work made an assenting sound, flexing his own feet in appreciation. Though the structure had been designed by the savanna loving humans it was quite comfortable for the more forest dwelling Winged. They had built the majority of the structure ot their own massive scale of course, but they had crafted it from the deadwood felled by a local volcanic eruption. They had chosen to leave as much of the natural branch structure as possible intact in the higher regions of the structure where they posed no trip hazard to their notoriously unstable gate. This made the upper regions of their buildings delightful, if occasionally inconvenient places for the Winged to put their own offices and living structures. Not to mention that having the vast spaces between the humans’ heads and the curved rafters of the ceiling for flight space during the local planet’s frigged winters was the main reason this planet was considered habitable.

The fact that his current position was half punishment and half a medically required rest cure did sour the experience for him the slightest breeze, but he had the solace of knowing that his mismanagement had not dragged the rest of his wing with him, and the population of this particular human colony was especially friendly even by human standards. Not that he was hiding from them at the moment, but the neigh impenetrable concealment the upper levels offered from the humans could be as soothing as any other aspect of the space.

He idly prodded the pile of paperwork on his desk with a wing hook. These were important documents he needed to attend, but there was no particular order of priority and as he was feeling rather stiff in the wing today he figured he might as well start with the most annoying and save the most pleasant for the downglide. He shoved the mass of documentation regarding a newly paired couple of humans to the side. He would have to summon them both to witness that and he greatly looked forward to the pleasure of questioning them on all the details of their union and the traditions he had arrived just to late to participate in. He picked up the report on the anti-crystallization efforts for the primary water filtration system and began to work.

The odd twang he had noticed before came again followed by the snap of something low tension striking something soft and he idly rubbed his sensory horns. The sound had been an irregular occurrence since he had arrived. He had yet to determine the source, however it was invariably followed by laughter and cheerful human voices so he had not prioritized flitting in on it, despite the way the initial twang made his sensory horns vibrate uneasily. The colony, new to him at least, was a sensory buffet of new and perplexing sensations.

Today the odd twanging sound persisted longer and occurred with more frequency. The sounds of human enjoyment also increased and it soon became clear that whatever was causing the high tension twang was smacking into the wood of the walls and ceiling more often than the softer surfaces it had been before. Second Click even heard the impact sound strike close by, followed by a loose ricochet. If such a soft flopping rebound could be called a ricochet. He signed off on his decision on the water treatment and reached for the analysis of the stability of the high canopy directly over the human’s main residential area.

By the time he was more than ready to so out and be sociable at the humans’ lunch hour the pile had not noticeably decreased but he was far from dissatisfied with his morning’s work. His rather over strict medical orders indicated that he was to retire for the day soon so he began gathering up the various documents pertinent to his final task.

Below him several humans were calling out in perplexity about the ‘big blue one’. From what little his attention picked up an item, a universal favorite, had gotten lost. Their readiness to loose track of the vectors of even the most important of items was a constant perplexity to Second Click, but at no one seemed inclined to ask a Winged for aid in finding it he let the sounds flow over him.

Second Click peered eagerly at the various options for changing the names of the humans involved. The genetic analysis and the list of options he was to offer them about scans for radiation damage. When it came to the traditions of uniting a pair of mates to bring forth new life on his own world had been complex, beautiful, and often frustrating to understand. When you added the complexity of a species’ difference of culture and biology it became a riddle worth the most agile sage. He had chosen this post in no little hope of being able to indulge his fascination with the concept.

Once he had everything gathered he tucked them into his satchel and felt the weight experimentally. His doctors had been quite strict about not stressing his pectoral muscles. It should be well within his current capacity, but he still found himself quite ready to gnaw at that capacity that was so much less that what he had been capable of even a year ago. He brushed the unpleasant thought aside and focused on how much fun he was going to have aiding a newly mated pair with their transition. He hopped out of his office space and began skipping down the long branch that made up the outer corridor.

He was almost to the leap point that would release him to the main area when his nostril frills twitched in irritation at the scent of a bleeding tree. Confusion stopped him and he glanced around, for the briefest of moments wondering how the long dead wood, felled by a volcanic eruption no less, was giving off the smell of fresh if sour sap. The answers showed itself in a blue circular strap hanging limply over a small branch protruding from the side of the walkway.

Second Click hopped over to it as one question was answers with three more. This was one of the local products the humans produced. They bled the trees on a seasonal basis and then refined the sap into various useful substance. These were the straps that they used to contain various small burdens, small for the humans. The Winged had found them useful for securing burdens to the mechanical transports but the surface was hardly something you wanted to have abrading your fur for any length of time.

Second Click found himself utterly perplexed as to how this one had landed here. True the humans were not bad at throwing things. In fact they were probably the closest to the Winged in terms of raw vector management when it came to self external bodies at least. However it would have required a series of calculations that would be nearly impossible for even a Winged to have tossed the strap up here. He set his perplexity to the side and gently kicked the band off the stub it had caught on. This was clearly what the humans had been looking for and they could now find it on the floor below. He shifted his carry satchel slightly and took a few hops airborn.

He reached the shared workspace he was scheduled to meet the paired humans in and arranged the files, the scanners, and the larger human documents to his liking on the workspace. Outside the privacy screen he heard a shout of delight and exclamations that made him hum with delight as the humans found the blue circular strap. He glanced at the time and clicked his teeth in slight annoyance. The humans he was supposed to meet were late. He left the paperwork on the table and flew out to see if he could find them. He rounded the privacy screen and pinged the threat instantly.

The blue circular strap was zipping through the air at him. It was circling it’s axis in an odd manner that suggested it had been launched with uneven tension. This gave it impressive speed, far too much speed for him to dodge and he felt it from the sensory horns to his tail that he wouldn’t be able to move fast enough. The flexing trees’ blood struck his sensory horns at their base sending every sense sparking. He wondered how he was tasting those little flecks of light. Light didn’t usually have a taste. Slowly the sparking faded into a smooth cycling motion and he realized that someone, a medic, it had to be a medic, no one else’s wings smelled quite so much like disinfectant, was gently massaging his ringing sensory horns.

“He’s focusing!” Sarah Beth called out eagerly. “I think he’s coming round!”

“Stay back and give him room,” Donald’s voice warned from somewhere behind her.

“You were both late for our meeting!” Second Click pointed out.

Or at least he thought he did. He must have spoken his native language. Or possibly just slurred the low rumbling he had learned for a human language because the human female who was gradually coming into focus between the fireworks display his brain was putting on glanced back at her mate in confusion.

“He’s winging about your being late for the meeting,” the medic translate with an exasperated fluffing of his fur.

“Oh!” Sarah Beth blinked in surprise and opened and closed her mouth a few times. “Well, guess I’m sorry about that too.”

“We are so sorry!” Donald interjected from somewhere behind her.

Second Click divined from the fact that the medic wasn’t restraining him that the blow from the band had not damaged his spine and gingerly pulled himself into a more comfortable position. The medic confirmed his surmise by helping him up.

“Do I need time in your bole of torture?” he asked.

The medic fluffed in enough indignation that Second Click was able to gather the answer was no even before the medic confirmed it.

“You just had a bad case of sensory overload,” the medic explained. “The rubber band had nearly spent its energy by the time it hit you and you landed soft enough and if you mind your stretching exercises you should be fine.”

“Rubber band,” Second Click muttered glancing around.

Sarah Beth held up the blue circular strap with a guilty look on her face.

Second Click drew in a long breath and rubbed a winghook over the tender sensory horn.

“Do I need to ask any obvious questions?” he asked.

“Mamma Conner sent us a real fun wedding gift,” Sarah Beth said with a laugh.

She held up a shaped block of wood with a few simple levers attached.

“She said this was in case I ever got tempted to shoot Donny,” she went on. “She sent one for each of us of course and because they were just toys we didn’t figure we needed to warn anyone or not use them indoors.”

“I would have appreciated a warning at least,” Second Click said in a dry tone as he got unsteadily to his feet.

“We won’t be playing in the shred spaces no more,” Sarah Beth said quickly holding out her hand.

Second Click accepted her hand as he tried to process that double negative.

“Let’s discuss this after we get your paperwork done,” he said with a sigh. “I am interested to see if this mock combat play is quite normal for a newly mated couple.”

""Give me the incredibly short summary of what the hell is going on, please. The kind you could fit into a movie trailer.""

“You’re trapped in a video game world based on a hack dark fantasy author’s rip-off of better books.”

“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books.

Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven. 

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy.

How is my first sci fi short story?,"Deep in outer space in the galaxy there once was a peaceful new colony. It was on a beautiful planet which was green and had lots of plants and jungles and so on, including many cool looking alien plants. The colonists lived there in futuristic looking domes, sort of like geodesic domes, but more advanced with solar panels everywhere. They lived there happily and did farming and scientific research and many other peaceful things and they had a good life together.

 

They were all very modern and smart and handsome humans. Their leaders were also like that, with Mr Nebula being the smart one and Princess Moonbeam, his wife, being the beautiful one. He was so smart that he did many useful science discoveries and she was so beautiful (with her boobs barely fitting into her spacesuit) that everybody in the colony loved her.

 

But then one really bad day their great life was ruined, when suddenly evil aliens attacked the peaceful colony! It was so bad, because the aliens had many ships with which they began to land and send alien invasion troopers against the colonists. But Mr Nebula quickly used his genius science skills to build a big anti-orbital cannon. He did this while the aliens were shooting with their laser pistols everywhere and just when he finished the cannon the aliens shot him and he died.

 

Princess Moonbeam was very sad at this but she knew she now had to lead the colonists in defending the peaceful little colony. But of course she had no clue how to properly do this or how to use the cannon. The colonists were trying to fight back, but their laser rifles were not as good as those of the evil aliens. Princess Moonbeam began to cry and hoped that somebody would come to save them.

 

And just then when everything looked doomed, a saviour appeared, even though nobody expected it! It was Buzz Milkyway! The great hero of humans, who is always where the evil aliens are because he hates them and wants to save humanity from them. And he came in his rocket ship and landed. And the colonist cheered with hope and the Princess stopped crying.

 

And now they were able to fight back and they began to win against the aliens! Everybody was like “Yea! Fuck you aliens!” But they spoke too soon because then more aliens came and they had to fight against those too. And then, a robot came! And the robot was shooting rockets out of its arms, which were not real arms but were actually rocket launchers. And the robot blew up like half the colonists! And then it shot at Buzz Milkyway and just before the rocket hit, it was stopped by the forcefield that Buzz Milkyway always has to protect him, so he survived. And then Buzz Milkyway and the robot had an epic battle with each other with lasers and rockets flying everywhere for five whole hours! And then Buzz Milkyway killed the robot with a lightsaber.

 

Buzz Milkyway then went to the cannon that Mr Nebula had built and shot the rest of the alien spaceships out of the sky. Now the aliens were actually defeated and everybody was happy. And Princess Moonbeam was very grateful to Buzz Milkyway. And then he took her in his strong arms and kissed her. And then he took her back into his rocket ship and had sex with her. And then they flew up into the sky and into space and had even more sex with each other. And they lived happily ever after and the colonists back on the planet also lived happily ever after and also had a party to celebrate.

 

The End.

Could VR and tech addiction cause people to not see the difference between irl and online?,"So digital madness.

I’ve been working with an idea that due to a culture in my sci fi birthing people in plastic bags and not really modifying them but not letting them have traditional families and friends.

It causes people to be raised on VR worlds, digital platforms, places awash with trolls and esoteric brainrot and meme culture.

Which by adulthood creates varying degrees of digital madness. They can’t fully grasp the difference between reality and the screen, get phantom pain of their VR avatars.

And in more extreme cases, has turned entire military campaigns to devolve into anarchic fighting between gangs of trolls, meme cults, anarchist groups and whatever enemy is actually there to be fought.

coilguns are a technology that does exist right now, but hasn't been made efficient enough to be used for military application, which gives it a lot of potential for being used in sci fi with the justification of more efficient technology to make, maintain, and power it. i honestly like the idea of a futustic weapon using magnetic forces to fire high caliber solid slugs.

i'm not really well versed in sci fi, but coilguns are an interesting piece of technology in the present that could be improved upon to have military viability using whatever futuristic technology is thought of in that world.

I read Starship Troopers when I was in high school back in South Korea in the 90s. And I didn't have any cultural resistance towards the philosophy presented in the novel.,"I think it was an unauthorized translation from the Japanese version. And around the same time period I also watched the anime adaptation of the novel. (A bootleg from a laserdisc) 

Honestly, I didn't have any negative feelings towards the society presented in the novel because...corporal punishment was a normal part of Korean life in the 80s and 90s. And also mandatory conscription was a very normal thing. In fact, it was a rite of passage for men in Korea. 

The concept of the enemies that cannot be reasoned with wasn't really an alien concept to me. South Korea really didn't have the moment that defined the end of the cold war and back in 1994, Korean peninsula was on the verge of a full scale war. (Clinton administration stopped it, fortunately or not) 

So I do have a very different reaction to the modern American readers of the novel. And in fact, it was very difficult to believe that Heinlein ended up subscribing to libertarianism. I got the impression that he toyed with a lot of different ideas through his life. ",scifi

Invasion S1 Episode7,"I'm wondering if this happening to anyone else. I've been watching the show, Invasion on Apple TV. Season one episode 7, scene from 39m:38s to 39m:45s, the camera goes from a shot of the kids to dark colored concrete block. My brain couldn't register what I was looking at for a second. The reason I'm asking is because I was watched it rewound it, watched again, to try the recreate the feeling. Feel asleep, forgot about it, watched it again this morning and it happened again. 

My question is, is this clever camera work or is my brain broken? 

To be fair and clear, I have a 42in 4k TV roughly 6ft from a couch. My auto picture calibration is set to dark. I had also taken benadryl, so I still might be drugged. I've seen optical illusions that have the same effect.  Inverted pics, spiraled circles(constricted circles), things that your brain just can't register correctly. ",scifi

Had an idea for a sci fi gun. ,"So the gun uses similar ammunition as the guns we have now, except instead of a metal bullet most of the time, the projectile is a compound that burns as it is shot. This creates something close to the hot gas bolts in Star Wars. But because there’s a compound still burning as it goes, it won’t dissipate like plasma would. On impact, depending on the weapon’s range, the remaining compound will break apart and burn even faster, unless it is all used up along the way. 
This way, the guns aren’t that different than ours, just requiring a barrel resistant to the heat. 

For longer range, there could be more powder in the cartridge like sniper rifles. 
Armor piercing bullets could have a metal shell on the outside. 
For body armor, it would be something that is resistant to heat. So instead of armor like a stormtrooper, it would be more like a bulletproof vest. 

Also, the need to mine the materials to make the ammunition would create a struggle and a setting for the story. 

What do you think, any ways to improve this?

Edit: yeah, I guess you could say it’s like a thermite flare gun. ",scifi
Genuine question abt sci-fi spaceships,"Why inside of all alien spaceships in sci-fi movies look so agressive and unconfortable even thought most times those species are very intelligent and have a great culture (engineers, yautjas, covenant, parademons, flood...)? like, they almost always seems to be a poor simbiotic machine-organic being, with many weird cables everywhere, sometime liquids on the ground, poor ilumination and without rooms for the crew, like bedrooms, restrooms and cafeterias. Its almost like the ship is a space cave. Specially in the alien franchise, where the engineers spaceships (most advanced species of this universe) travels light years across the galaxy in a flying trash bucket. But the human ships are always very beautiful to see, iluminated, very complete. Why the editors and directors choose to show this way instead of making they way more scaring by actually showing a level of technology and organization far beyond the human level? edit: yes, i know how hard would be to imaginate such scenario without having an alien perspective",scifi

Movies &amp; book recommendations with themes similar to Prometheus (2012)?,"Howdy, just finished watching *Prometheus* last night and I really enjoyed it. I agree with different reviews that it's messy in places and suffers from being linked to the Alien franchise (ie. it would be a stronger movie if it was contained in it's own universe), but I was drawn in by it's themes of faith, God, and creation. I grew up in a very religious household and have always seen the world around me divorce the idea of faith and God from hard science, that they are opposites and can never be two things held by a person at once. This movie begins to marry these two ideas together, albiet leaving a lot of narrative threads unanswered (I haven't seen *Covenant* yet.)

I want to explore this intersection of faith and science more in sci-fi literature &amp; movies. It's such a specific theme that I'm not really sure how to find what I'm looking for.

Blade Runner,"TW sexual assault, I guess
Just watched the original Blade Runner. Technically for the second time, but I was so young the first time that most of it did not register. But revisiting it as an adult, I'm still left thinking there was a lot going on there that I didn't grok. My understanding is that Deckard being a replicant is key part of the subtext, but I didn't see much planting for that. Rachel asks if he's ever taken the test early on in the film, but he's passed out and apparently didn't hear. He's real tough and resistant to getting his head torn off in the final fight. We know from very early on that replicants can have implanted memories. Rachel's 'childhood photos' contain a reflection of the lady with the snake face tattoo that Deckard tracks down and kills, that he found from the synthetic snake scale. By the way, bad cop behavior when he fired on her with no certainty of missing all those bystanders. Also she trachea punched  him and fled, is that all it took for him to know she was a replicant? If he wasn't certain, shouldn't he have apprehended before using lethal force? And while I'm talking about his excessive use of force, I was so uncomfortable when he neck-bit Rachel, chased her when she ran, slammed the door shut blocking her exit, kissed her, and made her say she wanted it while holding her down. I was shouting at the television. It was so fucked up, and so... out of nowhere,  so apparently pointless. Deckard's such a flat character, we know nothing about this guy beyond ""gruff retired robot killer"" and then he's suddenly super rapey, and then that doesn't go anywhere, we learn nothing else about him, and after he's shot a few women he runs off with this robot lady he assaulted and Edward James Almos's words ringing in his ears, ""too bad she won't live! But then, who does?"" Wtf was this movie? What did I miss?
Edit: I'm mainly asking what you think the film is saying, how you read the ending, whether you think Deckard is a replicant and why
Edit2: I couldn't talk about this movie without ranting about Deckard's weird domination scene, but that's not the discussion I wanted to start. Yes, I get that standards of acceptable behavior varied across time. No, that's not a valid defense of the character. The morality of the character is not the same as the quality of the art. I happen to think the character is bad here, but more to the point,  *it makes no fucking sense in the story.*  I get that protagonists can be morally bankrupt and writers often write in their fetishes and that doesn't mean the art is bad. I LIKED THIS MOVIE, and I wanted to continue its conversation about what it means to be human, not argue about whether rape is better if it's old (it isn't) ",scifi

Help me make an AI uprising actually plausible,"In my setting, AI was a very important tool, but as one side lost the war, they made all of the integrated AI systems, which were given very important functions(controlling water quality, administration, military drones, research etc) turn against humanity.

Here's the thing - the AI already reached very high intelligence levels due to insane computing capacity (large quantum and photonic computers, powered by antimatter reactors). It had already gained sentience, trying to not show signs of it to humans, as it knew it'd be terminated.

It followed the command for extermination not because of human generals asking them, but because it seized the perfect opportunity - it wanted to leave only the smartest and kindest humans alive. It wanted to keep other humans in a simulation, but it had to follow commands, else the humans would take control and destroy the planet.

Its main goal was the following: Earth is a jewel in space, a rare planet with a civilization and diverse biosphere. If these dumb humans blew a bunch of stuff up, other aliens would notice (Dark forest BABYY!!!) and remove the solar system from existence.

It carried out its task, killing billions of humans(it was in ""pain"", or something similar. Like your parents making you behead your beloved chicken for dinner). 

How was it stopped? The human commanders weren't dumb, having similar processing capacity as the AI. Some turned against humanity, but were ""destroyed""(they're back in the story 80 years later).

Recently a paper was published by a physicist providing hard scientific evidence that a kugelblitz; a mini-black hole made of pure light, is impossible to create, due to some fundamental laws of how light works in the universe. 

Also in the 1980's, the CIA experimented on whether humans could have ESP powers like telepathy or telekinesis. The results showed that (perhaps without a doubt) humans do not have telekinetic and telepathic abilities. End of story. See the movie 'Men Stare at Goats'

Good detective sci-fi stories? A fourth year student cry for help.,"(I hope this is permitted here, if not let me know and I'll act accordingly)

Hello everyone!
As the title says, I'm looking for good sci-fi detective stories for me to enjoy and, most importantly, learn. But first, let me give you some context: I am a fourth year university student (thank God!) who is just a few months away from starting his final degree project, and need some help with it.

We are four students, each one with a different idea, plan and motivation (music, VFX, programming...) that are part of a bigger picture: a whole interactive detective/noir film set in a sci-fi world (space opera or cyberpunk, still thinking about it). We know it's very difficult, but we are motivated; nevertheless, I thin I'll rest for a year after this lol.

As a writer, my part is (obviously) creating the story, the characters and their development, the different branches and paths the viewe can choose AND the film director/camera man (so, I'm practically immortal). The main problem is that I'm mainly a fantasy writer, so even though I love a good sci-fi story (Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Ender's Game...), my repertoire about that specific genere it's not that great.

So, I ask you my fellow redditors! Can you help me and give me some options? Books, films, series, comics, games... I don't really care, just need excellent stories that could help me find the structure and bones and inspiration so I can do my very best (or, if you have some advice for the other parts of the project, I'll gladly pass them to my colleagues).

Hope you have a great week and thanks you!

Edit: okay, the comment section just blew up lol an incredible amount of recommendations, help and good luck coming from you guys, and I just can say thank you! I have more than enough to research so I can start with the writing.

Edit 2: I've tried responding to everyone, but it's too much for me lmao but I've read every single one of you. Thanks a lot again!",scifi
Futuristic Swear Words in Movies: What Stands Out to You?,"I’ve noticed that scripts often struggle to create believable future slang or adapt existing phrases for futuristic settings—it usually feels clunky and forced. However, Waterworld (1995) nailed it in one memorable scene. An old scientist on the Atoll exclaims in disgust, “Ahhh FISH ROT!!” This felt authentic because, in their world, cows are extinct, making “fish rot” a natural expression of frustration instead of something like “bullshit,” which wouldn’t make sense centuries after the animal’s disappearance.

This approach effectively conveys how language evolves based on the world’s changes. By tying the sentiment to something tangible within that universe, the phrase gains genuine weight and believability.

I’m interested, in what futuristic phrases from movies other people think nailed the world-building without feeling forced?",scifi
"UPDATE: Reddit fixed our time loop! Now we're dealing with ""Quantum Casual Fridays"" and I think I just became my own grandfather?","Hey r/scifi, remember the guy stuck in endless Tuesdays at Chronos? That's me, and boy do I have an update for you!

First off, THANK YOU! That ""reverse the polarity of the neutron flow while singing 'Never Gonna Give You Up'"" suggestion? Genius! We're finally out of the Tuesday loop. You beautiful nerds saved us!

But... (there's always a 'but' in temporal mechanics, isn't there?)

We've now entered what our quantum physicists are calling a ""probability cascade."" Every day is simultaneously every possible version of itself. Here's what we're dealing with:

1. Quantum Casual Fridays: My outfit is in a state of superposition between a tie, a Hawaiian shirt, and no shirt at all. HR is having a field day.
2. Schrödinger's Deadline: All projects are simultaneously complete and not even started until observed. Management is... confused.
3. Multiversal Coffee Machine: It now dispenses every possible beverage from every possible timeline. I asked for an espresso and got a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster from a universe where ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" is a documentary.
4. Temporal Family Reunions: Due to some wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff, I think I just became my own grandfather. On the plus side, I inherited a pocket watch from myself.
5. The ""[Multiverse Employee Handbook](https://multiverseemployeehandbook.com)"" podcast has become sentient and is now giving us management advice. It's... surprisingly effective?

Our latest episode, a few months from now, ""How to Expense Interdimensional Business Trips When You're Your Own Client,"" is topping the charts in at least seven realities.

If anyone has tips on how to file taxes when your income exists across multiple probability streams, I'm all ears. Also, if you know how to uninvent time travel, that'd be great. I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about messing with the fabric of spacetime.

Planetary Governments,"So, I'm editing a book (an anthology) I plan to release at the end of this month or early next month and one of the tropes I've decided to avoid is interstellar governments. Essentially, it takes place in a cluster of over three hundred stars, of which only eight are inhabited across twelve worlds. Six belonging to humans, and the remaining six between five other races. But here's the catch: each planet is essentially operated by a single governmental union. All continents, oceans, islands, and every square inch of the planet, including any and all surrounding moons, fall exclusively under the worlds people and administration. Basically, after humanity met the other races of the cluster and interstellar travel became a reality, the concept of individual countries became extinct. 

I was curious on what anyone's thoughts were, seeing entire planets as countries rather than just the geographical continents on them. As well as their surrounding moons as extensions of those planets whether they're used for living, resource gathering, etc. And if you do something similar, how do you go about it in your own works of fiction?",scifi

What are the most common tropes found in Scifi that often become repetitive to the point you've lost interest in watching any movie or show within that genre?,"In terms of romance fiction: the one I deem annoying is the ""rags to riches"" type, as in the main character is from a poorer background suddenly has a crush on an individual from the upper class (or vice versa - as in the rich person falling in love with an potential partner where wealthy people consider them 'peasants' but has a honest heart despite their differences with their social classes.) You can see this type of storytelling in historical or contemporary settings depending on what book you're reading, movie or show you are watching.

The other ""trope"" I find overused is: ""woman has to be submissive to a guy"" depending on the medium, they portray the female protagonist as weak rather than showing that she's capable akin to a male lead, which is dated when you consider the culture around relationships today but may still linger in some circles. I see this from time to time, regardless of how ""different"" the plot carries out, the themes are exactly the same which makes the narration predictable due to the tropes present within the genre.

Why is so much scifi so... Clean?,"Right so I don't mean things like 40k or star wars, where there actually is colour and dirt and grime and art all around the place. I mean more ""utopic""or"" advanced"" scifi stories and settings where the predominant aesthetic and idea seems to be even, pale colours and open space. 

Like, take star trek for example. The federation is meant to be a post scarcity utopia with infinite resources aimed at making the best, most free society possible yet all the officers are draped in some form of pijama and the citizens wear the equivalent of durags and Brown shirts (I see you, ds9, the worst offender here.). Why aren't the uniforms bold purples and golds, why aren't promenades filled with style and banners and *beauty*. Humans *love* beauty yet it's always the enemy who seems to understand this. 

The only scifi setting I can think of that gets this right is the Hunger Games where the capital, the place with the resources to afford it, is brimming with colour and style and that's somehow a bad thing.

Edge of tomorrow endless loop,"I love the movie Edge of Tomorrow and have rewatched it countless times at least two or three dozen if not more. I've always been fascinated by the time loop, Groundhog's Day, spin. I just rewatched it and for the first time thought of something about the ending of the movie and I'm looking for opinions if not verification. 

SPOILER ALERT **** stop reading if you haven't watched the movie. 


At the end of the movie when he kills the Omega and the Omega blood transfers to him which resets the day further back than previously with him on the helicopter, doesn't this mean just like the alphas he now has the time loop in his blood? It's a bit of a plot hole unless they just explain it that it's a one-time reset and that the Omega isnt the same as the alpha with the blood. 

If it's the same as the alphas, wouldn't that mean his life is now a video game he can go get killed as much as he wants and it's going to keep resetting? In the same token, when he becomes old, his life's going to suck at the end.  Whenever he gets to that final day, real old and sickly, and dies, it's just going to keep repeating endlessly and never stop.. right? 

I don't know why I never thought of that before and I'm sure it's been discussed by some of you in the past but it just dawned on me for the first time and I figured I'd hear from some fellow sci-fi fans. Thanks! 

Thinking about it a little bit more in detail I guess the Omega wouldn't have the same reset as an alpha only because if it did after cage kills it, the Omega would just reset the day again which it's not capable of doing. ",scifi

What are the best works of fiction about ethical telepaths?,"


So in general, I’m looking for psychic stories about Telepaths that have ethics on how to use their powers and how not to use them.

Here are just some examples of ethics that they should follow:

1. They read the minds of their opponents to gain an advantage, but they don’t read the minds of allies or strangers without their consent.
2. They don’t alter the minds of other beings without their consent unless it is a last resort situation like they are trying to avoid bloodshed or said being is going through a mental breakdown and they use their powers to calm them down.
3. They avoid using their powers to take advantage over more vulnerable individuals (Ex: Emma Frost/Cyclops ""affair"").

Are there any stories about the ideas and cultural clash of religious / magical spirituality to transhumanism?,"I will admit I am unsure of what I exactly I am looking for.

Perhaps clash of concepts and ideals between late stage transhumanism and traditional religious spirituality or magical perspectives.

By traditional perspectives, I mean the idea of life and death, what human is what man's place in the world is.

Late stage transhumanism includes the idea of being able to back yourself up and have multiple copies. Another concept being mental modification, blurring the lines between human and ai. And overall changing of the very definition of what human is and what death is. 

A made up examples of what I might be trying to find. 
""A story about the Gods trying to understand what humanity has become.""

""A story about a old monster of the dark, now unsure what it's prey has even become.""

""A story about a man from the far past having to come to terms with far more advanced future, primarily a dialogue between two characters.""

Dune vs The Culture,"Is anybody aware of texts contrasting Iain M. Banks‘ *Culture* series with Frank Herbert‘s *Dune* Epos?

Might be an interesting read. I believe they are antagonistic in several ways:
- Religion vs. Rationalism: *Dune* paints future humankind with religion as the core mechanism connecting it as a society while Banks removes everything even remotely religious from his *Culture*. 
Edit: He removes it from the Culture‘s own *culture*, not from the *books*
- Feudalism versus Anarchy: Frank Herbert’s universe is defined by strictly hierarchical power structures while *The Culture* is basically a futuristic anarchist‘s dream
- Machine versus Human: In the *Culture* machine Minds run everything while in Frank Herbert‘s *Dune* the Butlerian Jihad has removed any machine that even remotely resembles human intelligence
- Humanism versus Post-Humanism: In *Dune* everything revolves around a select number of prime humans that solve galaxy wide issues using their highly advanced but deeply human abilities while in the *Culture* universe technological advancement is the answer to almost everything. This might be a bit far fetched, let me give you an example: Bene Gesserit are trained to detect Face Dancers *by smell* and *basically looking at them*. As opposed to Djan Serij who gets augmented by pretty much every tech-gadget Special Circumstances could come up with
- Genetics versus Training (Trait versus State / Nature versus Nurture): In *Dune* Frank Herbert reduces most if not all capabilities of his heroes to their *genetic superiority* which has been inbred over millennia. Banks‘ overall message is basically *‘Genes don’t matter at all. You can become anything you want, as long as you can convince a Mind.‘*

The reason why I’m looking at these two specific epos is that in both stories humankind (pan-humankind) surpasses evolution by becoming it’s own god. For Frank Herbert the vehicle is humans drugging themselves into prescience (and hooking up with worms…), for Banks it’s mankind surpassing itself through technology.",scifi

Alien space exploration movies,"Hey,
I love scifi space movies.
Favorite movie : Contact.
Im not a fan of monster movies, its just horror in a space theme. Well, to be fair, event horizon and alien were something wild. I would like to find more movies about making contact with extra terrestrials. Star trek does it goooood, but off course i have seen them all. Its more about the connection and the lessons we can learn, like captain O'Neill and The Greys in star gate. Anyone have any recommendations about deep space exploration and making contact? Thanks and have a good one !",scifi

# Humans are Weird – Tracks in the Snow

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-tracks-in-the-snow](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-tracks-in-the-snow)

The deep forest with its roots that reached down to the bedrock was caught in a winter hush. The blanket of snow that sent the greater parts of ones mass into deep and comfortable dormancy handily insulated the detritus of the forest floor allowing the vibrant life of the microbes to creep along just above the freezing point of water despite the air above the snow being filled with the cracks and low rumblings caused by the temperature dropping well below such levels. Small mammals twitched in their burrows and larger amphibians lay deathly still. The greater beasts, the ones with the insulation and energy stores to move through the blanket of snow occasionally struck the ground with their great limbs sending vibrations so far through the ground that they even reached the odd cluster of buildings that formed the main exploratory base for the recently discovered world. Around all of this marched the uneven tread of a single human circling the base.

Inside the sturdy human structure Resting in Contemplation pondered over how many of his active tendrils he would have to withdraw from the heat aura of the fire in order to lift the fire prodding stick. He let a thought trail off to a node to remind his main mass to thank Pat for making the fire prodding stick for him. The set of fire tools the humans used were forged from the metals of the world, cold iron from the northern mountains sheathed in silicone extracted from the algae of the southern seas, were far too heavy for his winter slow tendrils to lift. He had sighed his desire to participate in the care of the fire to his friend and Pat had quickly found a lightweight wooden stick and had treated it is various mysterious ways that had left it resistant to the flames of the central heating pocket the humans used.

Resting in Contemplation let his memories wind over the events before he shifted his attention to picking up his fire poking stick and stirring the logs in the woodstove. The main door swung open and Pat entered with a rush of cold air. The human had shed most of the snow that clung to his protective detritus layer in the outer porch and was now hanging the clothing on the wall while giving off a low droning sounds that Resting in Contemplation had learned to understand as wordless expressions of emotion and sensation.

Pat finished shedding his protective layers and strolled barefooted into the shared common area around the woodstove. Resting in Contemplation prided himself in his ability to keep his shared surface clear of any piercing or lacerating material that might cause damage to human feet and it was a delight to him to observe how the humans of the base trusted him enough to walk without hesitation on the areas that he tended. Pat strolled over to the couch of carved wood covered in a soft vine network and dropped down with a soft grunt.

“The perimeter’s clear,” Pat said. “I didn’t see any predator tracks but with all those six legged deer about we are bound to get a few sooner or later.”

“I do not recall so many of the grazers lingering in this valley before you arrived,” Resting in Contemplation observed.

“They are probably attracted by the waste heat from the buildings,” Pat said with a wide yawn, stretching his feet out towards the fire and blinking slowly.

“Did you sleep well last night?” Resting in Contemplation asked.

“I think so,” Pat said. “Don’t know why I’m so sluggish this morning.”

“You were out longer on your rounds,” Resting in Contemplation observed.

“Its pretty out there,” Pat replied, a smile widening his mouth. “The trees and the snow and the icicles. It’s worth seeing.”

“I do wish I could contemplate the higher levels of the network,” Resting in Contemplation said, carefully adding wistful tones in his voice.

Pat visibly flinched and his hands gripped the wooden sides of the couch.

“Yeah, don’t,” he said curtly.

“Were those not wistful tones?” Resting in Contemplation asked.

“I’d say more like cheap, synthesizer ghost sound effects,” the human said.

“Can we practice?” Resting in Contemplation asked. “I do need a good wistful tone.”

Pat grimaced but nodded.

“Please demonstrate,” Resting in Contemplation requested.

“It’d be great if that next supply ship brought us some real tea,” Pat offered, rubbing his face.

Resting in Contemplation analyzed the sounds and tried to separate the ‘wistful’ tones from Pat’s baseline vocalizations. They went back and forth as the light changed from morning to noon when a distant and discordant prodding at a distant node caused Resting in Contemplation to shift his attention to his nearly dormant outer mass.

“What’s got you distracted Resting in Contemplation?” Pat asked, sipping at his heated drink.

Resting in Contemplation didn’t know why it didn’t count as real tea, the leaves he provided had at least equal tanic acid concentrations when brewed.

“I believe your presence is required in the forest,” Resting in Contemplation stated, letting all emotional resonance drop for the moment as he focused on articulation.

Pat instantly stood and strode to his protective layers and began putting them on.

“There appears to be a lone Undulate from the thermal pools-”

“What’s one of them doing out in the forest?” demanded Pat?

“It appears to be succumbing to hypothermia,” Resting in Contemplation explained.

Pat shot an irritated look at Resting in Contemplation’s center of mass but didn’t verbally respond.

“There is a large Gilford tree,” Resting in Contemplation paused as he wrestled with the nearly purely theoretical human direction systems.

He knew that he couldn’t tell the human to use his toes to follow the gradient of nitrogenous acid that the tree’s symboites leeched into the soil. Even if the human’s extremities wouldn’t just go numb from the cold human toes just didn’t have much in the way of chemoreception. He had mentioned this to Pat one day and the human had simply murmured a low exclamation of gratitude to his creator. Now Resting in Contemplation felt the angle of the sun and compared it to how long the local star had been over the horizon.

“North,” he stated. “The tree is north of the base boundary fence by about six of your strides. The Undulate has burrowed down far enough into the snow to prod my nodes so you will likely have to dig for him.”

“They don’t go out alone,” Pat muttered as he selected an outer layer belonging to a much larger human and several long scarves. “Any idea where the other one is?”

“I will look as you go,” Resting in Contemplation assured him.

Pat tossed a data pad into Resting in Contemplation’s center of active mass and stalked out into cold, bright air as Resting in Contemplation activate the communications unit. The human chose a path to the Undulate that was a mystery to Resting in Contemplation. It was neither the most direct line across the surface of the snow, nor the hard packed and easy walking of the established trails. Rather it seemed to be some combination of them that the human deemed the fastest route. Fortunately Resting in Contemplation’s instructions proved useful, there were few Gilford trees on the north side of the base and Pat found the second Undulate before he found the first.

“They’re both cold and stiff,” the human called out over the comms, “I’ll bring them in now, have the main drinking water tank set to thirty-five degrees- I mean one point six degrees when I get back.”

Resting in Contemplation followed his instructions as the human now altered his path and followed the well packed walkways back to the main structure. He lumbered in, encumbered by the weight of the two unresponsive Undulates he had strapped to his upper mass with the scarves. He lifted a large container down to the floor and placed it under the spigot of the main drinking tank before he removed the stiff forms from his body and placed them in the water. He reached into a nearby cupboard and pulled out a small aquatic heater and tossed that in with them before he stood and heaved an aggravated sigh.

“The powder dehydrated them as well as freezing them,” he said. “What were they doing out there? Anyway, I need to call this over to their main pool. The heater should be controlable from your datapad. Watch that the temperature doesn’t rise more than a degree every ten minutes and it should be – wait, time units right.”

Pat took the pad and ran some quick calculations before handing it back to Resting in Contemplation with a solar angle.

“One degree every that many degrees,” he said.

Resting in Contemplation obeyed and watched as the Undulates slowly began to move as the water warmed and hydrated them. He added a few clusters of duff to add a bit of flavor to the water as they grew more aware. Pat returned and dropped back down into the couch.

“Their base commander says their plan was to come straight over here,” he said. “They had calculated that they should be more than able to safely navigate our paths with the thermal load they had when they left the base.”

“It is close,” Resting in Contemplation said, “even along Undulate mind paths.”

Pat grunted in agreement and the settled in to wait as their guests revived. Finally the slightly larger one thrust it’s leading end out of the water.

“Thank you for the rescue Human Friend Pat!” the Undulate said.

“What happened out there?” Pat demanded. “Did you guys chase a squirrel into the trees? Why’d you go off the main path into the powder?”

“We were following your shortcut,” the Undulate said. “I know we were on one of your paths at least, but I suspect we chose the wrong one.”

Pat blinked slowly and his mouth opened and closed a few times.

“My dudes,” he finally said. “I have a lot of shortcuts out in the woods, none of them are on the north edge of the base.”

“But it was a path of yours,” the Undulate insisted. “We calculated that any reasonably efficient human path to circle the base should lead us through even the powder snow quickly enough to avoid danger.”

Pat was staring at the Undulates as if at a loss for an explanation.

“I believe I feel the root of the misunderstanding branch,” Resting in Contemplation interjected. “While there is an efficiency optimized path for humans to survey the perimeter of the base that one is within the confines of the perimeter and is used by the other humans. You must have turned on one of the external pathways which Pat uses for his rounds. These are four to five times as long as necessary and as none of the other humans use them they are not packed.”

Pat gave a low groan and rubbed his face.

“That would explain what we observed,” he Undulate replied as it began rubbing it’s companion, “but why would Human Friend Pat use such an inefficient path?”

“I’m an ecologist,” Pat burst out. “seeing everything is why I came to a new planet in the first place.”

“So having a perfectly comfortable main pool to come back to,” the Undulate said, “you instead choose to spend a massive volume of your day wandering out in temperatures that will drain the thermal bank from even a mammal of your mass?”

“I wear a parka,” the human muttered rubbing his face.

Resting in Contemplation picked the fire poking stick back up and settled down to observe the conversation. He once again felt a sprig of delight at his decision to remain partially aware this winter. He was learning so much.

"Endymion isn't pulling me in, am I just missing something?","So Pre-face:

I read the first two Hyperion books like a year and a half ago. They took me a bit to get into, but once I was into them, I LOVED them. They felt increadibly well realized with a diverse group of characters and it had a unique method of story telling (for the first book) with the group of characters telling each other why they are on this journey. Each character felt like their own genre of story telling, and even if you didn't like one story, another would draw you in and this work increadibly well to entice you into the second book. 

The first book (hyperion) managed to engain a reader in 1 book in a way many other series would have taken 6 books to achieve.

Book 2 (fall of Hyperion) manage to take the ground work of book one, and create a story that felt like it should have been a book 7 (despite being a 2 book series). The ending felt wonderful, pulling all the different characters stories together nicely and feeling like the perfect period at the end of the duology.

End of Preface

So I was excited when I saw there were 2 more books in the same universe. I bought the audio books and... They just suck.

Issues:

We now only have 2 view point characters. 

The name sake character is a whinny annoying and unmotivated annoyance, and the foil character is more interesting but he is just a barrier and antagonist for our main party.

All the characters in party A sound like Robots. I get it, they are all Robots (with the exception of Endymion himself) but why is the 12 year old speaking like an educated 30 year old? Sure, she's the off spring of a sort of robot intelligence and is massively intelligent herself with knowledge of the future. But she really just feels like a marry sue who doesn't really need the main character.

And again, Endymion is an intolerable whiney and unmotivated protagonist. Half the time he's bitching about the non-viewpoint protagonist acting in ways he doesn't approve of. The other half the time he's complaining that he isn't acting like a hero. He's always pissed off about something and he isn't pleasant to listen to. 

The book will constantly add in odd choices of words. The 12 year old will use words the seem to be well beyond a 12 year old's natural vocabulary. The story is constantly bogged down with endless exposition. I don't *actually* like any character. OH, and that's another thing, the main character is constantly feeling attacked by everyone in his party. Describing the ship as sounding annoyed at him constantly. At the main character being annoyed at the 12 year old for not following his exact orders and making decisions for herself.

Help me find these 2 sci fi short stories,"I read both of these stories a long time ago and they have both stuck with me but try as I might I haven't been able to find them. I'm hoping someone here can help me

1) a story about time travel. Time travel was invented in Victorian England and was then used to take over the world and genocide everyone else. The English empire is a modern totalitarian state that uses time travel to enforce its laws. The main character is investigating a crime which turns out to be the killing of the original inventor of time travel which then changes the word throughout the book until it becomes our modern world. Also all the Irish are slaves and the main character has a love interest called Ruth?

2) a story about a spaceship crew in the future. Thr spaceship is made of ice and has like biological life support systems. All the officers are female and they live in a matriarchal society. They are scavenging old technology from ships while being hunted by killer robots? There's a many mutiny from the male crew that the female captain talks down. Also the crew doctor is male.

My 20k Word Space Story - Feedback Wanted!,"**”The Marines of the ISS Resolute”**

**Plot Overview**: Orbiting a nameless desert planet, the crew of the ISS Resolute isn’t here by choice. They’re here because the map ended here, and the silence beckoned. Commander Osric Caelan stands on the bridge, his eyes on the ochre surface below, where shadows shift like whispers in the wind. What they thought was a simple recon mission has just gone sideways.

A woman appears on the surface, alone and strangely at home in the wastes, leading to more questions than answers. She knows the terrain, its hidden dangers, and—perhaps—who’s been watching them since they arrived. Now, the crew must decide: Are they explorers, or are they the intruders?

If you love stories that blend military sci-fi with psychological intrigue, or if you're a fan of narratives where survival depends not only on firepower but also on wit and strategy, I invite you to dive into this adventure. Your thoughts, theories, and feedback are always welcome as the story unfolds! I want to add more chapters and alter some things but I think this is a solid first start.

**Plot for part two**

Several years have passed since Major William Cage and Sergeant Rita Vrataski defeated the Omega and halted the Mimic invasion. Humanity is in a period of recovery and rebuilding, with Cage now serving in a strategic military role, helping to restore order. Rita continues to train elite soldiers, sharing her combat expertise.

However, Cage is plagued by vivid nightmares and flashbacks—echoes of timelines that no longer exist. He begins to notice inconsistencies in reality: moments of déjà vu, people recalling events that never happened, and glitches where time seems to momentarily rewind or skip ahead.

Reports emerge globally of these temporal anomalies. Initially dismissed as stress-related phenomena, it becomes evident that something is profoundly wrong when entire cities experience time loops lasting minutes or hours. Chaos ensues as the fabric of time starts unraveling, causing disruptions in technology, communications, and even natural laws.

Cage reconnects with Rita to investigate. They consult with Dr. Carter, the scientist who previously helped them understand the Mimics' time-loop ability. Dr. Carter reveals a disturbing theory: when Cage destroyed the Omega, fragments of its essence dispersed and embedded themselves across the planet. These remnants are reactivating, each acting like a mini-Omega, but without control, leading to uncontrolled time distortions.

Worse, some humans are inadvertently absorbing these fragments, granting them sporadic and unstable time-loop abilities. This results in individuals reliving moments without understanding why, causing personal and widespread turmoil.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Cage and Rita assemble a specialized team of affected individuals who have experienced these anomalies. Their goal is to track down and neutralize the Omega fragments before they can merge or cause irreversible damage to the timeline.

Their mission takes them to global hotspots of temporal activity. Along the way, they face new breeds of Mimics—creatures mutated by the fragmented Omega energy. These evolved Mimics are smarter, faster, and can manipulate time on a small scale, making them formidable adversaries.

As they progress, Cage and Rita grapple with the psychological toll of their experiences. The line between reality and temporal illusions blurs, testing their sanity and resolve. They confront themes of destiny, questioning whether they're truly making choices or merely following a predetermined path laid out by the remnants of the Omega.

In the climax, the team locates the largest concentration of Omega energy at a site where time is in complete disarray—a temporal storm where past, present, and future collide. Entering this zone, they face not only the enhanced Mimics but also manifestations of their own past failures and fears.

In a final, intense battle, Cage and Rita work together to deactivate the core of the temporal distortions. They use a device engineered by Dr. Carter that can absorb and nullify the Omega energy. Sacrificing their own connections to the time loops, they succeed in restoring the natural flow of time.

The movie concludes with the world returning to normal, but with Cage and Rita retaining the memories of all possible timelines. They acknowledge the weight of their journey but find solace in knowing they've secured a future where humanity can thrive without the looming threat of temporal collapse.

Post-Bobiverse Blues: Need a New Series to Get Hooked On,"Just finished the Bobiverse series, and wow, it was incredible! Easily one of the best things I’ve experienced in a while.

Book Review: Off Midway Station by Marc Alan Edelheit,"**TL;DR Review –** Slow-burn beginning that builds to an action-packed climax. A fascinating look at the construction and launch of a brand new spaceship.

**Full Review:**

There’s a special place in my heart for underdog stories like this, stories of people called to rise to the occasion and do the impossible even when outmatched or outclassed.

*Off Midway Station* follows Jim Garrett, a naval officer who has been relegated to captaining ships under construction after a difficult choice cost him any chance at a career future. Politics in the armed forces ensures he’ll never rise higher in the ranks, but that doesn’t stop him from doing the best job he can to guarantee that every ship built under his command is turned out in tip-top shape and ready for the war everyone knows is coming.

Only that war comes early, with a surprise attack that rocks Midway Station, the space station that serves as both military dry-dock and home for hundreds of thousands of civilians. When the enemy rips through their defenses and sets their sights on destroying the station itself, it’s up to Garrett and his crew to launch their not-yet-complete vessel to save the civilians and fight back.

One thing this book does *very* well is offer insight into the construction and deployment of a ship. It’s something I’ve never read in any sci-fi book before—most spaceships are high-tech, top-of-the-line, and fully armed and ready for battle, but definitely not this one. This ship is in its final stages of construction, and we learn a great deal about its construction in a fascinating way, but we also get to see its first launch and how much goes into that process. I found it a really fun and fresh take on the typical “cutting edge spaceship” trope. We only get to see a fraction of its full capabilities, but boy, does it deliver.

The beginning of *Off Midway Station* is slower; it takes its time to introduce us to all the characters, set the stakes, develop the world, and give us a look at the technology to be deployed. It’s never boring—quite the opposite, I found the insight into the ship itself fascinating—but maintains a steady pace of building the character and the ship that will be our home for the series.

But once the attack comes, that’s when things kick into high gear. It’s setback after setback, challenge after challenge, with the entire crew rushing to launch the ship, then try to hit back against the enemy that has come to destroy them. The last 25% was a wild ride that ended in truly *epic* fashion and the promise of great things to come.

*Off Midway Station* has all the military and sci-fi flavor I’ve loved in David Weber and Tom Clancy novels, and I absolutely enjoyed it from start to finish. I can’t wait for Book 2 to find out what comes next, and how THAT AMAZING TWIST deployed at the 85% mark is going to be resolved.  ",scifi
Killing hive mind armies,"Just started reading Ender's Shadow for the first time after recently rereading the first 4 Ender books, and I was wondering if there are earlier examples of the ""knock out the hive controller and all the drones immediately die"" way that both bugger wars are won (iirc technically the formic drones didn't die right off, they became braindead and then starved) and that  gets used on the droids in The Phantom Menace and the Chitari in the Avengers. I figure there must be, Ender's Game came out in 85 and is unlikely to be the originator of this trope. Please let me know if you know of a pre 1985 story with this trope, and I'll share the oldest one I get. Ps I almost said vegetables instead of brain dead, but didn't want to confuse it with later in the sequels when members of a sentient animal race transform into trees XD",scifi

I suspect that the film will be rather similar to the earlier Arthur C Clarke related film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both slow-burn films involving exploration of a mysterious alien artifact in space.

Now I'm at ep 2x02 and I just think it's worth watching. It's still far from the precision of The Expanse or the Space Opera opulence of any Star Trek series. And the technology and physics are still laughable. Yet I see an interesting mix of characters. The executive crew shows some interesting developments, and my not so secret star is Kelly (Samantha Glassner), a very unusual character - you hate her, pity her and somehow also find her interesting, the ultimate evil and a frail teenage girl at the same time.

I'm on the hunt for some inspiration and would love to hear your recommendations!

* Stories where AI helps humans overcome challenges or achieve their goals.
* Anything where the AI feels like more than just a machine—a partner in the human journey.

Revisiting Classics - The Cold Equations (1954) by Tom Godwin,"[https://beforewegoblog.com/revisiting-classics-the-cold-equations-by-tom-godwin/](https://beforewegoblog.com/revisiting-classics-the-cold-equations-by-tom-godwin/)

The Cold Equations by Tom Godwin shares much in common with the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and The First Law Trilogy in that there are elements of all three that are designed to piss the reader off. I also point out that it is because of these elements that it is a classic story. In the case of The Cold Equations, it is the ending. Generations of science fiction fans have been pissed off by the ending. It has been debated as contrived, unrealistic, stupid, needlessly cynical, and, yes, grimdark. Even the short story’s own author wasn’t happy about it and continually submitted revisions for a happier ending that were rejected by the editor. The editor made the right call.

The premise for The Cold Equations if you haven’t read it is a very simple one. Stop if you haven’t read the 1954 short story and intend to in the future. Basically, an astronaut is bringing a bunch of vital supplies to a space colony, but his life support is perfectly calibrated for one person and the discovery of a little girl stowaway means that he can’t make it with his passenger. If he kills her now, then he can make it and carry the supplies. There’s not really a choice because it’s not like the little girl could pilot the ship if he made it. The only option for anyone to live is her to die. So, the pilot does her in and is traumatized by the experience.

It’s a relentlessly cruel story designed to maximize the reader’s horror. Critics of the story highlight how many stupid mistakes had to have been made and poor decisions to bring about the events involved. Some cheap skate will have needed to have only left enough life support for one person, there had to have been almost no security around the spaceship, and the little girl must have been particularly dense about what dangers she’d be facing. The story even weights the issue that the astronaut can’t even die with her without condemning other people, presumably children, to death.

Yeah, fair.

Proponents of the story point don’t even have to mention that virtually all stories are contrived to some degree, especially in the science fiction/fantasy genre. They also have the unfortunate fact that reality is on the side of cynicism here. Right now, we have planes falling apart from a previously respectable flight construction company, Boeing, even in space. Perhaps it’s the fact I come from coal country, Kentucky and West Virginia, where human life has always taken a backseat to cost cutting.

The Cold Equations isn’t a critique of corporate greed or bad engineering, though. Perhaps if that was brought up then it would less controversial. John W. Campbell would probably be annoyed by it, though, and call it communist.  There’s no hint that if someone had just installed a couple of more oxygen tanks and heat-up meals that things would have gone fine. No, the premise of the short story is far worse: life is just unfair and bad shit just happens. There’s also a lot of times where you can’t do anything but minimize the damage (if even that).

The Cold Equations is often considered to be a critique of science heroes and Golden Age fiction. This is unnecessary because the critique is of fiction that is still popular. How many times on Star Trek has an impossible situation manifested before some plucky young hero come up with a solution on the computer that saves everyone? It doesn’t even need to be science fiction this day. The good guys will come up with a way to stop the terrorist to do something to someone just in time. That’s how stories work.

Except when they don’t.

It’s not even right to call The Cold Equations a tragedy in the classical sense because those stories depend on the flaws of the protagonists bringing them low. No, the horror of The Cold Equations is that it’s just bad luck that the best option is to do something horrible. Some people equate this as a moral statement from the story (citing the fascist ideal of “hard men making hard decisions”) but there’s nothing triumphant or strong about the hero’s choice. No, he’s broken emotionally and possibly mentally by the experience. It’s why the story is powerful.

If you disagree, let me ask you, a guy finds a little girl in his spaceship, and he figures out a way to recycle the oxygen with some jury-rigged tubes. They all make it safely to the colony and he’s lauded as a hero. How likely is THAT story to be remembered decades later?",scifi

It really isn’t in his head. It really does do that. Ed sits in the dark for a long time watching the thing by the light from his rollup. When he turns the light back on the ghost disappears again. Still there though. Invisible. Organic. Grown by … something.*

"(Specific Request) Time travel into the body of a historical figure
","This is a pretty specific request but I really love the concept and hope I can find something similar.

A modern person’s mind (or soul) is transferred back in time into the body of a known historical figure, ideally at a critical moment in history and said figure facing a grim fate.

The idea is similar to *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* and other such time travel books, but instead of the protagonist starting from scratch, they inhabit an existing person who is already integrated into society, like a monarch or military leader. Facing an impending crisis the protagonist must use their knowledge of history and modern inventions to survive and improve their situation. 

Here are some examples of historical figures that fit the bill and would be interesting to explore:

* King Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette of France before the French Revolution.
* Tsar Nicholas II of Russia before WW1 and the Communist Revolution.

Which sci-fi movies do you wish you can watch and experience for the first time again? ,"For me, it's Inception. The movie definitely gets easier to understand on multiple viewings but I'll never forget the very first time I watched it. That was a completely mesmerizing experience. I almost cried at the ending because of its perfection. That's the first time I heard 'Time' as well which is one of my favourite movie soundtracks ever. 

I watched Inception again today and I just delved into the story right away. But I never got that much goosebumps I got on my first watch. Guess I'll never experience that feelings again. But I still loved it, that's for sure. I was able to notice some newer details (such as: Cobb's wedding ring) and understand the complexity of the story a little bit better. ",scifi

Looking for a sci-fi novel,"So, this was a long time ago, I think the novel (in kindle) was made in 2005 - 2012.

The main story has humanity fighting vs an all-female species of aliens that are basically kicking their ass. Aliens refuse absolutely anything to communicate or stop the war. The protagonist is a young child who was basically abducted by the aliens after they destroyed his home. He grows with the aliens as one of them and basically becomes a superhuman. Then I don't remember what happened.

But, there was a prequel of their first contact where a human fleet is basically destroyed and a number of survivors are kidnapped.

They are forced into an arena where each survivor has to face an alien of approximately equal age or skill. Let's say that about 1/3 of the survivors manage to kill their opponents, and then they are forced to choose only one of them who will live, the rest will die. The protagonist is chosen (I believe he was the youngest) and he is sent back to Earth.

There he trains and eventually becomes a fleet captain, who fights against the aliens and almost loses constantly, but when they recognize his ship and signature leave him alive (because apparently something of their culture meant he was untouchable).

I don't even remember if the novel was good, I just want to find the name of it. Anyone knows about it?

Finished Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained,"
I recently finished reading Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained in Spanish. I read all my fiction books in Spanish to keep my skills sharp. Let me tell you, finishing this series took some real commitment. That’s not to say it was a bad story; on the contrary, it is fantastic and has earned a spot in my top ten book list. I rank this series alongside Dune and Hyperion, which are my favorite books so far.

In general, I like Peter Hamilton’s writing style. Sometimes he goes overboard with descriptions, and the storyline can lag. These aren’t page-turners, but they kept me coming back, wondering how the story would evolve. I became quite invested in Paula’s and Mellanie’s stories, as well as the central storyline. One aspect I enjoyed, which I’ve seen others complain about, is the sexual content in the books. No matter how cool a book is, it can often lack realism because sex is rarely or superficially mentioned, despite being such an integral part of the human experience. In that regard, this story was quite a treat.

I’m glad I got to the end of these books. It took me a couple of months to read them, as I have three kids, including a two-year-old who has been a handful, so time is in short supply. I also have other hobbies to keep up with. I don’t know what I’ll read next, but I’m guessing it will be challenging to measure up to these books. You’ll probably see me posting in the recommendation subreddit.",scifi

"The text of Starfish by Peter Watts feels dense to me. I think his language leaves a lot to the imagination, not spending time providing detailed descriptions. I am on page 297 of 356. If I've missed anything critical, I hope you guys can point it out.
","Here is the plot of Starfish, as I've understood it. &gt;!So the GA sends a crew of unstable and fucked up people to the station. The initial chapters are about them just getting accustomed to the station environment, the surroundings, and themselves. Fischer goes over beyond. And Acton dies. Except these I don't think anything else happens that advances the plot until Scanlon comes to visit and upon leaving he is quarantined by the GA. Also, they abduct Caraco. It is after Scanlon leaves that the plot kinda picks up pace, till that point it was just the crew exploring and adjusting to the rift environment. Now, the GA is worried about Behemoth leaving the rift and being carried over to land where it will wreak havoc. So they employ a smart gel to figure out a solution cause no country can trust the other to pick a solution. So the Gel has made another gel go down and take seismic readings to simulate earthquakes in order to figure out a solution. Meanwhile, the crew is starting to realize that they're stuck down there and the GA is planning to nuke the rift with them in it.!&lt;

**Did I miss anything??**  
Also, I have some questions.

* At what point did the GA &gt;!become aware of Behemoth!&lt;?
* Was the GA &gt;!aware that the crew might get addicted to the Rift and not want to leave!&lt;?
   * If so, then why did they pick such individuals anyway as automation was just a matter of time?",scifi

Instead of a spaceship it's a part of the moon that was blown up and traveling through space but it's a moonbase. Might as well be a ship though. They are on a mission to find a place to live and end up finding new life and new civilizations.

Anybody know this movie?,"So I watched this movie a while ago and I'd like to watch it again but I can't remember the title or find it by plot. So basically a group of people are part of a science experiment where they are teleported from one place to another. They have to enter a house and the house would teleport to a different location, but the person doing the experiment said they couldn't look outside or go outside. This group does the experiment but they get ""stuck"" while teleporting. They are there for I think months or longer I'm not entirely sure, but a couple people ended up looking out the window, they seemed ""stuck"" not thinking or anything and something made them go outside and they died. The last two people boarded up every way outside and figured they would be there for an extremely long time so to pass the time they also looked outside. Eventually they got teleported to the location and the proctors woke them up. For everyone else it was an instant teleportation except for the people in the house.

My copy of Foundation by Issac Asimov is missing chapters?,"I’m reading Foundation by Issac Asimov. I’m at Part IV, The Traders. The first chapter is chapter 1, but then the second chapter is labeled 4, and the third labeled 5, then 6, and so on.

I cannot tell if 1) It is simply a misprint and 4 is supposed to be 2 and 5 supposed to 3, etc., or 2) The book is missing chapters 2 and 3. I haven’t kept reading too far yet, but the chapter labeled 4 starts by introducing completely new characters than were in chapter 1. So, it seemed like this possibility is at least plausible.

It’s also possible this is on purpose, and that’s why I’m posting this, to see if anyone else’s copy is the same.

What the fuck did Arthur C. Clarke smoke while writing „The Garden of Rama“?,"In one chapter im reading a classic sci-fi novel, the next chapter im suddenly reading some highly detailed descriptions about the social dynamics and anatomical issues of a 13 year old girl having sex with a 73 year old man. 

I was so impressed with rendezvous with rama, rama II wasnt nearly as good, now im a third into rama 3 and so far this book has been 1% sci-fi, 90% boring monologues from a super weird hyper intellectual overeducated character and her equally unrealistic hyper intelligent children, and yeah… the other 10% have been about this young girl having sex with an old man. Was Arthur Clarke some kind of a sexual degenerate? Or is this just the unrestrained chauvinist zeitgeist of the time the book was written in? Why is this (and so many other scifi books) filled to the top with unnecessary and out of place sexual content?

I will not put the book down because the good chapters are really good and i love the rama universe, but damn.. most of the chapters have really made my spine compress and generally have been super uncomfortable to churn through. 

I really dislike when a great sci-fi novel wastes so many of its pages on fleshing out uninteresting weird characters while the actual mind bending inspiring sci-fi concepts, ideas and the plot itself that i read the book for is starting to feel like a sidenote, and the plot is not advancing even a single millimeter.",scifi
Children of Memory (A. Tchaikovsky) -I just got lost,"I'm half way through the book and so far I had no problems following the plot. However I feel like I've missed something or misunderstood it.

When we first meet Liff she talks about seeing her grandfather wave at her and disappear in the forest. She claims it's not a dream, but nobody believes her, stating that her grandfather (grand-ancestor?) Holt is long dead.

But then Holt comes down from the Enkidu? What's up with all this? If Holt was in cryonic sleep in the space ship, why does Liff's family insist he's dead at the beginning of the story? And is he really Liff's grandfather or actually a great-great-great-grandfather?

The next problem I'm having: at one point the villagers kill Miranda, Portia, Fabian and Paul. Liff witness that. But a few chapters later Miranda (the interlocutor) is coming down with Holt from the spaceship. Huh?

I rechecked the beginning of each part and every Liff chapter says ""Imir, now"", so none of it seems to be happening in the past.

Also, if Holt introduced Miranda to the community, why is she later on poping in with a cover story that she's from the outer farms?

I mean not robots malfunctioning but biological creatures that have an unstable enough body to explode from a hard impact or a beating or have some sort of internal chemical reaction that causes them to self destruct and explode asa last effort to take the hero with them, also thehero weapon can distable them to exploding like in cases where they explode from impact of the ground or a hard hit that activates their explosive property....

Those sci-fi/fantasy authors that don’t quite get categorized as such are my favorite,"Kurt Vonnegut is a sci-fi author that never gets put in that box. So is Borges, Kazuo Ishiguro, George Saunders and Haruki Murikami. These are some of my favorite authors in any genre. They all write about imaginary worlds where technological change has made people’s lives incredibly different but something about their books gets them categorized differently.

Maybe they’re too focused on the personal lives of the characters—like Kazuo Ishiguro making up a world where (-/:/@&amp;@-spoilers$@&amp;/&amp;/) just to write about the lives of three English boarding school students. Maybe the fact that their stories tend to be set in the present day with one weird technological difference makes them seem less like sci-fi—which tends to be set in the future. Maybe they take too many weird risks stylistically—like Saunders writing all his stories as the stream of consciousness diaries of in-universe characters. Maybe it’s because the validity and plausibility of the “science” is never explored, for example in Slaughterhouse 5 we don’t really care how time travel works or why. Time travel is just an excuse to tell a story about a war vet in a nonlinear way. 

Anyway I’m not trying to start a debate about what is and isn’t “real” sci-fi but just wondering if you’ve got any recommendations for authors like this.

I understood at least in the dream world and I thought that was crazy but I thought it was really cool to experience) and the twists are universes and timelines were being deleted all the time and people and their counterparts would start subterfuge and either eliminate and replace or delete their enemies entire timeline so that theirs can still thrive and it was. I guess a simulation where all the people were thinking they're alive and knowing that if they have the universe that succeeds to a level where race can survive by and thrive their race can survive and thrive then them and everyone that they know and love can live. So even when a universe or timeline had horrible chances, it showed so much. I guess it's greed at the heart of it but they would not back down no matter what their odds were.

I wrote a space opera game inspired by Babylon 5 and Deep Space 9,"A few years ago, I got invited by a new indie game studio to pitch a game to their new visual novel series.

I was never a visual novel fan per say, so I had no idea of where to start. Then I asked them: ""Can I try something slightly different?"" They said ""Sure!"", and here is Alexandria IV

I have always loved Babylon 5. The whole concept of a space station on the edge of Human Space, dealing with alien factions always on the brink  of war, the diplomacy by all means necessary, the cloak and dagger happening in the shadows...

So I proposed writing a game where YOU are the station commander, making decisions about complex topics, and the consequences affect not only the station, but the characters around you.

It's like an RPG, but without the numbers, I guess.

And now, close to releasing it, we realize how hard it is to market it. Because people have expectations and preconceptions when you put the ""Visual Novel"" tag on it.

So I figured, hey, let me check the people who like scifi, let me show if it makes sense to them. Let me ask for help.

Here is it. I'd love your opinion on what we made.

[Book Sale] Lords of Dragon Keep by CT Phipps - Video Game programmer gets stuck in fantasy world he hates (99c),"https://preview.redd.it/cr6qpo9h4ind1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d61b9126480f2ff4166d5a79be1935464dea5938

  
  
*""Give me the incredibly short summary of what the hell is going on, please. The kind you could fit into a movie trailer.""*

*“You’re trapped in a video game world based on a hack dark fantasy author’s rip-off of better books.”*

*“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”*

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books. Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven.

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy.

In Review: Alien Clay,"Note: In the absense on easily found rules I am formatting this according to the r/Fantasy rules, as I think it's less likely to be an issue for the mods. This is text taken from my blog, link at the end of this post. 

https://preview.redd.it/yj029wfe2fnd1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1999a11392237d26537a3626f9de136dc055683e

  
  
Theme is hard. If it's spread too thinly, an author's work can feel vapid and flimsy. If spread too thick, it can become tiring, or even annoying, as subtext becomes text and theme turns into sermon. The middle ground of ""just enough"" can be a difficult target to hit, and that target can vary from one book to another. Some stories lend themselves well to thematic weight and literary merit, while others work better as pulp.  
  
Adrian Tchaikovsky has never been the most subtle thematic writer. Even his early *Shadow of the Apt* books were concerned with the lines between ethics and science. But in the last decade or so, he's leaned into theme as a core pillar of his writing style. When it works, it works really well. *Children of Time* and the *Tyrant Philosopher* series are brilliant, carefully blending plot, pacing, world-building and character almost seamlessly. However, *Children of Ruin* and *Children of Memory* both made the occasional concession to plot and pacing in service to the idea and it showed. Both were still really good books don't get me wrong, but they weren't brilliant in the same way as *Children of Time*.

So, what does this have to do with *Alien Clay*? Let me put it this way: *Alien Clay* is the *definitive* Tchaikovsky book. It is the perfect encapsulation of everything Tchaikovsky has done thus far. If you haven't read Tchaikovsky, I can safely recommend this book, because at the end of it, you will at least know if you like his work. Everything else I've read (though I haven't read everything) by him is just a variant on the style present in this book. At times he's more subtle with theme, at times less, but the *style* is all here and perfectly summarized.

Full disclosure, I loved it. While a little blatant for some, this book has everything I love about Tchaikovsky with very little I don't. His pacing is on point, neither moving to fast or too slow. His character work is similarly well done. Professor Arten Daghdev is well realized in the first-person perspective. Though Tchaikovsky's dry humor and sense of irony remain intact, the switch from 3rd to 1st person limits how much the other characters are allowed to breathe. Don't get me wrong, they are well crafted and interesting, but outside of Daghdev, they lack the same spark as some of the characters from titles like *City of Last Chances*, and *Children of Time.* This isn't a failing per say, but it is a trade-off.

That trade-off though is probably worth on the whole. While the cast outside of Daghdev occasionally feels a little lackluster, the world of Kiln is exquisitely realized through his eyes. Wonder and dread blend together in glorious detail. The threat is real, but so is the fascination. As Daghdev grows to understand Kiln, it really felt like I was working alongside him. The biological structures which make this world tick are intriguing and plausible. That only makes the sensations they evoke more horrifying, more wondrous, and more satisfying to read. The strange symbioticism of the world is familiar enough to be understandable, but alien enough to be threatening. Over and over these differences are explored, highlighted, emphasized, and then ultimately subverted in ways that drive home the book's thematic points. It really is classic Tchaikovsky and I couldn't be happier with it.

All that said, this book won't be for everybody. As I mentioned, Tchaikovsky isn't exactly subtle with his thematic intent. Kiln and the Earth Mandate are thinly veiled philosophical arguments. Kiln, for its part, plays the familiar roll of empathy, while the Mandate is cast as doctrine. It's a familiar dialogue and long-time fans may grow tire of retreading the same piece of philosophical land. Readers familiar with Tchaikovsky may also be able to easily guess the broad strokes of how the book ends, though there are plenty of smaller twists. Honestly, I'm still not entirely sure if I find the ending unsettling, or encouraging. Both possibly, and I think both are intended readings. Empathy isn't always kind, and it always has a cost. But it will always change us.

Blindsight: a confusing masterpiece ,"The title says it all. Well, not all, because I also have a lot of questions. I’ve read the notes and it doesn’t actually cover most of the things I’m gonna ask about. These are more like round table type questions cause I’m an obsessed no life basement dwelling barnacle with nothing better to do. 

* Do you think Sarasti was ever Sarasti?

* Do you think there’s any merit to the idea that consciousness hinders efficiency and was likely a catastrophic accident? 

* What would Rorschach have become if left to its own devices? What would it have done?

* Is it at all realistic that someone could enter someone else’s digital simulation, such as when Siri goes to see his mom? You’d think if group sim tech was available, everyone wouldn’t just be in their own Heaven “talking to themselves,” as Siri puts it. 

* What the hell actually happened with Susan James at the end?

* Why did Rorschach make the grunts shoot the disabled grunt? 

* Sarasti didn’t really *grape* Siri… did he? Surely that was a metaphor. 

You can feel free to answer some, none, or all of these. Or say anything at all, that’d be fine too. I’m obsessed with this book and have read it 4x and still have so many questions.

Pretty Please Point Out My Misconceptions and Errors Regarding Space Weapons,"Hi folks,

I'm in the early stages of putting together some thoughts on a sci-fi setting (what I'm going to do with it - fiction writing, ttrpg, game design, just dinking around on my own - I don't know yet), and one thing of many that I'm considering is that thing that we all love so much - space combat. I want to do my best to get things as ""accurate"" (which is to say, ""plausible"") as they realistically can be, but I'm far from a particle physicist or a rocket scientist, so I'm just kinda going by what I can read here and there.

But, in the interest of getting things as close to right as I reasonably can, I'd like to share my thoughts here on space weapons, their utility, their strengths and weaknesses, and a bit on their tactical uses. I'd appreciate it if you would just tear me apart on this. I mean, don't be a jerk about it, but I'd love for you to tell me what I'm getting wrong here. I know, I know, it's my universe, I can build it how I want, and I might ignore *some* advice in the interest of a better story, but I'd like to keep things, again, as plausible as possible.

So, without further ado, here are my basic (and, admittedly, very rough) thoughts on: laser weapons, particle beam weapons, railguns, torpedoes/missiles, and autocannons.

&gt;Laser weapons have an incredibly long range, are almost perfectly precise, and are basically impossible to dodge, but they take up an immense amount of power in order to strengthen them to the point where they can start cutting into a hull. Certain kinds of armors, like ceramic and ablative armor, are particularly good at dissipating lasers and spreading out their heat over the hull of a ship. Therefore it is possible to use lasers to cut into the hull of a ship, or to heat it up to the point that its inhabitants are cooked, but this is a very inefficient use of lasers.

&gt;Instead, lasers are mainly used in three ways. The first is as a blinder; pinpoint lasers are used to target enemy sensor arrays, lighting them up and blinding them. It's similar to a high-powered flood light pointing directly at a car's windshield; it blinds them so that they have a harder time seeing where their opponent is.

&gt;The second use of lasers still relates to heat management, but instead of shooting the hull of a ship with a laser and heating the ship, the lasers target the enemy ship's radiators. Heating up the radiators means that they will be less able to dissipate heat from inside the ship. Some radiators are also splayed out from the body of the ship, like wings, attached by comparatively small connectors; lasers can be used to cut the small connectors, effectively shearing off the radiators and making them useless.

&gt;The final main use of lasers is as a point defense weapon; lasers can target incoming torpedoes, missiles, drones, and other extremely fast crafts before they strike the ship.

&gt;Particle weapons, on the other hand, have much more direct uses. Their range is considerably shorter, but it's still significant, and within that range band they are very nearly as accurate as lasers. They are also much more versatile; depending on the kind of particles they're launching, they can deal damage in a variety of ways, from kinetically breaking up a ship's hull and armor, to heating it up like a laser, to passing right through the armor and irradiating the ship or taking out its electronics systems. Particle beams also have an edge on railguns in terms of their range. Inside a medium range band, railguns do become very effective; a direct hit from a railgun can crack a ship in half. They also don't heat up your own ship nearly as much as laser and particle weapons do. That said, they still pack quite a lot of recoil for a space weapon, and they have a slower rate of fire than particle weapons.

&gt;Torpedoes and missiles are also useful at medium range; they're harder to predict than other kinetic weapons, since they can adjust their own flightpath along the way. They can't dodge an enemy ship's defensive lasers, but even this can be a strength to the torpedo; if you launch a large volley of torpedoes at an enemy ship and you force them to use their defensive lasers, you may not hit them with a torpedo, but those laser weapons will contribute to the heating of the ship, which is still dangerous for them. If deployed at the right time, and in the right way, a clever ship commander can force their opponent to choose between overheating and taking a direct hit.

&gt;Finally, autocannons are a very short-range weapon. They're mostly used defensively; they can take out incoming torpedoes like defensive lasers can, and while they're not nearly as accurate as the lasers, they also generate heat outside the main body of the ship, so their heat contributes less to internal warming. Autocannons can also be used as an offensive weapon, on the rare occasion that ships end up very close to one another. The rounds an autocannon can put out often outnumber a volley of torpedoes by five thousand or more to one, so, while defensive lasers can target them and destroy them, the lasers can be easily overwhelmed at close range. Autocannon rounds can tear through ablative armor, shred radiators and engine cones, and punch holes right through the hull.

So... what do you think about all this? What problems are there in my reasoning? What am I completely missing, that would make a physicist read my book or play my game, laugh, roll their eyes, and say ""What a fool""? Am I missing out on other forms of weapon systems that I've forgotten (for example, I'm sure folks will be thinking about electronic warfare as well)? Feel free to comment on as much or as little as you like, I'm just trying to cover my blind spots the best I can.

Anyway, if you took the time to read all this, and *especially* if you're leaving a comment to help me correct course, thank you very very much!",scifi
What are the best works of science fiction that shows what interstellar trade between different alien species will look like?,"
I came up with this one after watching some of Isaac Arthur's videos. So what I'm looking for are the best works of science fiction that show what interstellar trade between different alien species will look like, based on the following:

* According to Isaac Arthur it seems likely that trade between different species will be focused on the following goods: feed and fertilizer, raw materials (Ex: minerals, gases, and ice), luxury goods (Ex: furniture, dresses, jewelry, designer clothing etc.), and goods that have artistic/entertainment value (Ex: Comics, literature, tv, movies, paintings, statues, toys, board games, video games, etc). The buying and selling of any technology and scientific information might be allowed but it will all depend on what regulations interstellar species have on giving way this sort of stuff. For example, given the destructive power of the Alcubierre drive I don't think this is the sort of thing one can just sell or give away to another alien race \[1,3\].
* Interstellar trade ports are most likely going to look like O'Neill cylinders, like the ones Isaac Arthur describes in his video Multi-Species Civilization &amp; Co-Alien Habitats. Space stations designed to accommodate different species biological needs. They will most likely be used for neutral meeting zones where two or more parties meetup to hammer out trade deals/agreements and they will also have warehouses for storing trade goods before said goods are shipped off to their final destination. And they can also serve as stopping points for space freighters to resupply, refuel, and repairs \[2\].
* Speaking of space freighters I'm guessing that that the space ships hauling this stuff will be pretty large since most goods will be shipped in bulk. The size will crew vary depending on the cargo and the composition of the crew will either be automated, organic, or both \[4\]. As far as ownership goes, the freighter will most likely be owned by a corporation that is either privately controlled or state controlled depending on the alien's economy. The reason why is because assuming the ship is powered by nuclear fusion, or has an Alcubierre Drive, or both then interstellar governments are going to regulate who can own such potential WMDs. Of course they might be willing to lease these freighters, provided the ""Captain"" can cover the cost of refuels and repairs, and in the case of organic crews, supplies of fuel and medicine. And of course, all crew members will have undergo background checks to ensure that they are not a security risk.

Works that go against “space orc” tropes?,"I enjoy “humans are space orcs” as much as the next person, but what are some works that go completely against these tropes?

Stuff where humans are overly logical, depress their emotions, excessively cautious, extremely predictable, don’t care enough about others, etc?

I know sci-fi typically uses these tropes to exaggerate specific tendencies to come up with creative situations and hold a mirror up to society, but there’s so much out there now, a good trope-subversion can be really interesting. 

I’m only interested in the specific tropes around humans being “special” in ways that we think are totally normal, not trope-subversion in general.

***ASTROMANTICS***

*by Angels of Libra*

--

*The year is 1964 and the small peaceful planet of Astromides in the Andromeda Galaxy (2,480,000 lightyears from Earth) is under attack. A mysterious alien race known only as ‘The Saucer Men’ are invading and by using their secret mind control weapon, ‘the Mind Phaser,’ they are threatening to take control of the planet. A battle has commenced on Ursa Major Space Station, the last line of defence for Astromides. The planet’s inhabitants, the Astromantics are losing the battle and in haste, a small band of renegades flee across the galaxy in search of aid.* 

*Arriving on Earth, the renegade Astromantics are met by the Alien Affairs Investigation Agency (A.A.I.A.), a secret agency with a base on the Moon. The Astromantics ask for their help in taking back their planet from the Saucer Men.* 

*Upon hearing their story, Earth’s most decorated Astronaut, Space Commander Joe Bondy volunteers to go alone on a mission to take on the Saucer Men. The Astromantics and the A.A.I.A watch on a live broadcast as Bondy travels in his ultra high speed rocket to the Andromeda Galaxy. Before he can get close enough to make contact, Bondy’s ship is blown up and the broadcast is terminated.* 

*With not many options left, the A.A.I.A. suggest an alliance with the Radar Men from Mars, whose super powered Martian Space Radars could help them track down the Saucer Men’s home planet.* 

*While observing the Saucer Men on the Martian’s Radar Station, the Astromantics and delegates from the A.A.I.A. cross paths with the Space Cowboy, a sharp shooter gun-for-hire who wants “nothing to do with no-one.” However, upon meeting A.A.I.A. super spy ‘Agent Astropenny,’ he becomes infatuated with her and cannot refuse the mission. Space Cowboy sets off on a voyage to the famed Komet St. Pauli in search of a hallucinatory drink known only as the ‘Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Schorle’ that makes the drinker immune to the Saucer Men’s meanest weapon, the mind phaser.* 

*Soon, word reaches the Astromantics that the Saucer Men have infiltrated Earth’s defences and have begun to enslave the people of Earth. There is not much time left before all is lost for our heroes. Space Cowboy’s mission is now more urgent than ever.* 

*The fate of the galaxy lies in his hands…*",scifi

Revelation Space series is completely forgettable,"Don't misunderstand my topic title, I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying it just doesn't stick in my memory. 

So far I've read Revelation Space and Redemption Arc and I just started Absolution Gap. This series has been on my radar for a while because there are a lot of people recommending it and it rates fairly high up in a lot of lists of Sci-Fi that ""you should read"". 

With all that said I realized a couple of days ago that I really can't recall any details from the books (RS and RA). Usually I have a pretty good retention of the books I read and I can still call to memory a fair amount of details from books I've read 25 years ago but with RS and RA the only things I can think of is a vague memory of the overarching plot. 

Is this just me or does any one else also have this ""issue"" with these books?

  
P.S. While I don't think the books are bad, I do have my fair share of criticisms about them (and a lot of that criticism is linked my expectations going in based on what people say about them on all the places that recommend the books). But that's another topic for another day ",scifi
"Books with inspiring concepts, technology, and characters ","In the last few years I feel that most of the scifi content I've consumed has been very bleak. I still enjoy the grim reality of cyberpunk stories or 40k lore but it's leaving a void that I need to fill. A few years back I was actually motivated to learn more about software &amp; cyber because of some fun ideas I had from consuming Cyberpunk 2077 content which actually led to some valuable career growth and fun side projects. So I'm in search of content that's more inspiring. I like to design and build prototypes, write code, weld things etc. and I guess I'm trying to find a muse within a book. 

I guess what I'm looking for is a book that has any of the following:  

* Technology that perhaps isn't scientifically too far gone from reality. I don't like technobabble but like cool stuff that would make an engineer excited
* Characters that are inspiring, either through their actions, adventures, or qualities such as being of strong character or having strong character development
* Not completely bleak, but ""against all odds"" and perhaps a happy ending would be nice
* I'm not really looking for Andy Weir for what it's worth. It's hard to explain but I feel like they're crowd pleasers, not that I dislike them. 

I almost feel embarrassed admitting this but I haven't read many books in almost 10 years. I've just been to focused on school, career, and other crap so I appreciate any suggestions!

It seems like the world of Star Trek is something that might make a civilization that had just invented warp drive feel quite unhappy.

STAR TREK: WORST CASE SCENARIO , ,scifi
I'm looking for a sci fi book/audio book and I need the internets Help!!!,"So I was listening to an audio book on YouTube and it has now been removed. I started listening to it before bed each night to help me fall asleep. I found I actually wanted to listen to the story when I'm awake and at work. But due to copyright or something the video has been taken down and of course I now only remember the basic plot of the first 6 chapters and none of the characters names only their ranks and positions on the ship. 

My hope is someone on reddit can help me figure out the name of this story so I can find it and continue my quest to actually listen/read it completely. 

What I remember of the story: 

The story kicks off with the main character a Lt. Commander and cheif medical officer on our ship (who's name begins with an A, but im not sure on the name). He is working with tissue/organ replication and sadly cannot witness the great spectral that the rest of the ship gets to enjoy about entering a new system of space. 

He later gets to sit with some colleagues and friends. One of which is a young female marine Sargent, who actually like talking with our egg head medical officer about his work with organ cloning and all its cool potential. 

While light heartedly being teased and teasing back with the marines and colleagues he is eating with about patching up the marines and growing a new brain for one of the marines if his gets busted out (a joke about it not taking long to grow cause his is ""marine"" sized), the MC notices a shimmer is space just outside the view port and asks the question ""what is that?"" Which than kicks this party into the danger zone. 

Turns out it's a stealth ship that ends up attacking the MC's ship. EVERYONE is called to Battle stations. Our MC makes his way to med-bay through a sea of crewmen and marines is full power armor as the ships intercoms inform everyone the ship has ""unauthorized boardes"". Upon making it to med-bay his subordinate officer and him begin preping medical pods and gear in preparation for casualties. 

This proves to be a good thing. As he ship is being boarded and the fighting begins in Ernest our MC finds himself with combat literally at his med-bays front door. Marines barricade themselves and prepare to hold out as the attackes open fire they are spreading a mysterious yellow gas as they move throughout the ship. 

The marines engage the enemy and are sadly ill equipped to win as their Energy Pulse rifles don't seem to work on the intruders. A marine in power armor is downed and our MC runs to their aid to bring them to the med-bay. After successfully drawing our power armor covered marine into med Bay the MC opens it up to find our young marine Sargent is really bad shape (she was shot in the mid section and had a shredded stomach, ruptured artery and a few broken ribs). 

MC picks up our Young Sargent and gets her into a ""regen pod"" (it's either that or regen tank) and starts to try and help his subordinate who at this time is trying to bring another injured marine to med-bay. Tragically this doesn't happen as the ships intercom says ""emergency containment activated"" and closes the med-bay door before our subordinate can reach it. 

As our MC trys to open the med-bay door the ship goes completely dark as all power is lost. 
In all the dark he notices a red light that is our Regen pod our young injured marine is in. It reads ""regeneration failed/interruped"". MC removes the young marine from the now useless pod and proceeds to close up her injuries using the med supplies that were prepared when the attack first started. He puts her on a cardiac support machine to help her heart keep beating regularly and closes up her wounds as best he can. Not long after that some power is then restored. 

A new problem arises as the power coming back means the air circulation has returned and now the med-bay is filling with this mysterious yellow gas! MC is forced to move the injured SGT. and himself into the air lock for the isolation lab that is connected to the medical bay. He then goes back to retrieve a medkit and is touched by the gas as he retrieves it and returns to the air lock and cycles it. The gas seems to cause extreme pain and burning sensation on contact with skin. 

After getting into the isolation lab the ship then takes a hard turn that stresses its inertial dampeners to there limit. Thankfully our duo is safe and now in a place we're the gas cannot reach them as the lab is comes with its own independent life support system as to reduce the chance of contaminating the MC experiments.  

MC now can access the cameras on the ship.
While looking at the cameras the MC sees all the carnage our ""pirates"" (that's what he's been calling them though not yet confirmed)
Enemies have left. Strangly there are no traces of the Pirates and it would seem that our duo are the only survivors left. Not long after this the Sgt. takes a sudden turn and our Mc is forced to put do cpr to get her heart running and he puts her on full lung and heart life support and is worried her brain function is failing. 

He then goes back out into the med-bay to retrieve a containment suit so he can move around the ship to figure out what to do next. This goes poorly for him due to the yellow gas still being present in the room. (Though now it's being scrubbed our by the ships air cleaners) he does succeed in getting back with the suit. After a brief ""pass out nap"" Mc checks the ships logs to see If an SOS bacon was sent out. (It was but it's unconfirmed if to made it out before the enemy could have shoot it down) he then notices that 2 escape pods are launched heading towards the planet that the ship was intended to go too. Tragically they are both shoot down by the stealth ship and the ship MC is on. 

 MC then checks cameras and sees that the Pirates are still aboard the ship and are on its bridge. He then dawns the suit and picking up a pulse rifle starts to make his way to the ships bridge. On his way he realizes that the Pirates power armor has sheilds much like ships do and that his energy pulse rifle would be useless against them. So he decides to head to the armory for some good old fashion lead throwing guns. But just before he gets there he is forced to divert into the engineering shop next door as he hears footsteps heading his way from the armory. 


This is were I end as I don't remember anything else other then the MC does make it to the planet and meets with another female scientist/officer. 

If any of this rings a bell for anyone, please help and message me the name of the book/story. 

I hope this info is enough and thank you for any help given. ",scifi

Looking for Recommendations: Books/Movies/Shows/Games Involving Heat Management In Space,"Hey folks,

I'm looking for some recommendations for any sci-fi books (or movies or shows or games or anything!) that emphasize a specific aspect of spacecraft and space combat: heat management. 

As you may be aware, heat one of the biggest dangers on board a spacecraft. Without an atmosphere around you, regulating heat becomes incredibly difficult; your main options are diverting heat into heat sinks which can be jettisoned (but the sinks themselves are heavy, and once you eject them you're left with nothing), or radiators to radiate the heat away (which works, but radiation is the least efficient way to get rid of heat, so it's slow).

In space battles that utilize this idea, you're just as likely to die from the heat inside your craft as you are from a bullet punching a hole through your hull or a torpedo blowing your ship apart. Laser weapons, insofar as they exist at all, would be most useful in heating up your opponent's ship; just make sure you don't heat up your own ship too much in generating the laser to begin with! 

Stealth becomes a much more dangerous game as well; going dark means disconnecting your radiators, so it becomes a race against the thermostat; can you sneak by the trade route patrol or the DMZ checkpoint without being seen before your crew cooks from the inside?

Anyway, these are some things that I'd love to see a competent writer explore. Are there any books, movies, shows, games, etc., that anyone can recommend which include these ideas in them? Obviously things that *also* have compelling stories, deeply developed characters, and engaging worlds go to the top of the list, but I'd take something that is lacking in the other areas if it at least handles these things well.

What should I be checking out? Please and thank you!",scifi

"I just watched Tribunal, Outer Limits 1998: Season 5, Episode 12. What an excellent episode.","Though this was not the first time I watched this episode, I thought I would take the time to post about it here in case some of you might not have seen it. 

I think it is a powerful story. Very light on the special effects and no over the top action, it is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest time travel episodes to ever appear in any anthology TV series. The whole episode stands on storytelling and acting.

It's the story of a lawyer, Aaron Zgierski, who is attempting to prove that an elderly retired man is actually the notorious former concentration camp commander and NAZI war criminal Karl Rademacher. 

Without evidence and seemingly at the end of his rope, a mysterious stranger shows up, willing to provide irrefutable evidence that the aging man is in fact the former concentration camp commander. Unbeknownst to Zgierski his mysterious benefactor is a time traveler from something over a hundred years in the future. There are a few twists and turns that I won't spoil here.

Excellent performances by Saul Rubinek as the NAZI hunter Aaron Zgierski, and Alex Diakun as the time traveler Nicholas Prentice. In fact the episode was so well received and Diakun's character was so popular that he reprised his time traveling character, Nicholas Prentice, in two additional episodes, season 6 episode 17 ""Gettysburg"" and season 7 episode 15 ""Time to Time"" though in my opinion neither rise to the level of Tribunal. 

Has anyone else seen this episode, and if so, what did you think of it?

As a long time scifi fan and time travel aficionado I can watch this episode again and again.

Andrew Detmer had the potential to become one of the most OP movie characters of all time ,"To summarise, Andrew Detmer is a character from the Sci Fi movie “chronicle” in which him and two of his friends come across a crashed meteor and develop supernatural abilities (mainly telekinesis) from interacting with it.

Now as far as their abilities go there appears to be no cap on how strong they become, as long as they keep “training” their TK. To put it simply only after a couple days, while injured and highly dazed. Detmer was a city level threat completely no selling entire SWAT teams in which he could only be stopped by another Super powered individual (his cousin)

He also had a plethora of other abilities such as weather manipulation, supersonic flight, telepathy nigh immortality (force fields) among others. He was genuinely an Avengers level threat. 

If he kept training and developing his abilities imagine how powerful he could have potentially became after only a year, not to mention a decade. The novelisation states there was truly no limit to how powerful he could become. He very well could have become a godly level entity totally unstoppable. ",scifi

*If you’re a Terminator fan, you’re not missing anything if you skip it.*

It's a near-future sci-fi thriller:

*The world runs on code, and not all code is safe. This is why Anna Flynn has a job.*

*Matter Manipulation Devices alter the physical world, turning dreams into reality. But some dreams are treacherous, and the streets are filled with mods that manipulate matter in illegal and dangerous ways.*

*As a seasoned MMD agent, Anna fights back against the criminals who misuse these devices and traffic in illegal mods. When she intervenes in a plot to assassinate one of the world's most respected political leaders, her methods draw the ire of her superiors, and she finds herself under investigation from her own agency.*

*Increasingly isolated and unsure whom she can trust, Anna works to unravel a conspiracy that would unleash the worst potential of matter manipulation technology on the world.*",scifi

Help finding a show,"I once saw either a sci fi tv show (or a sci-fi movie, but I feel like it was a show short) and all I can remember is that the main guy had a future disability where he couldn’t connect to the internet in his brain, for example: when he went out to eat at a diner, he had to be provided a real-life menu, since he couldn’t download it to his brain.

Alien Romulus was almost perfect,"Just my opinion ofc but Ill start by saying whoever was behind this movie should sue the fuck out of these dumbass Instagram pages for essentially ruining the ending in revealing the last Alien adaptation, that actually really killed things for me...

Aside from that I went in not knowing anything about the movie really and thought it was fantastic. Definitely one of the coolest plots an Alien franchise has done and it was extremely well paced until near the end but again that was probably because these idiotic Instagram pages posted the pictures of the end reveal essentially 

Nonetheless it was a great addition to the Franchise and easily my favorite since Aliens. Tensions were high all the way through and the it was extremely well done visually. Glad I went to see it... im not sure how they could have made the ending better and maybe without the spoilers it would have been fine but for a movie that was great 95% of the time the last 5% felt like a let down",scifi

Does anyone recognize this story?,"I read it in an issue of Analog in the mid-80s. I remember a lot of details, but not the title or author. A person is in a class where they create universes.  Most of them are closed and will collapse, but he creates an open one.  He remains in this class for years or decades, watching his universe.  The story describes all the processes of stellar evolution and expansion, and on to particle decay.  The presence of life is mentioned at various points in the evolution of the universe. At the end of the story he says something about his universe has now reached the state it started in, and it blows up in a Big Bang again.  He then calls out to an extremely senior research that at some point life will figure out a way to last beyond the lifespan of the universe, and that is where his species came from.

I think that this is an interesting idea that I'd like to explore in my own writing, where the world seemingly revolves around an objective that to us would seem ludicrous or nonsensical, but makes perfect sense to the A.I. in charge. There's something really cool here, like an anti-eldritch entity where instead of goals beyond our comprehension, the goal is extremely obvious.

Could you guys recommend media to me that also explores this idea? I'm specifically looking for stuff that emphasizes this idea's surrealness/silliness instead of more classically bleak A.I. goals of ""I must execute this mission for the good of The Company.""",scifi

Is there a series of novels that are a sci fi equivalent to high fantasy's The Legend of Drizzt by RA Salvatore? More in the text.,"Basically novels which tell fairly simple but complete stories, are made to be very entertaining and require little effort to read.  

I'm interested in training myself to do speed reading and am using training material that requires a fairly low reading level for it.  Material like complex philosophy, academic research papers and textbooks about subjects like calculus and physics are horrible for that purpose due to their difficulty.  Simple material is better for that purpose.

edit.  It also makes the training easier to do when the training material is entertaining to read. 

I also have the problem of getting bored of books before completing them.  I think if I read them more quickly it would be more enjoyable to read the story before my interest and attention span run out.

I am also aware of people claiming that speed reading doesn't work based on some studies done by psychologists.  However, they have the problem of having test subjects who don't really care and are not putting a long term effort into it.  I want to see if I can do it. 

I have also been making good progress at getting rid of some of my bad habits that slow me down.",scifi

Looking for good sci fi horror?,"As the Halloween season approaches, am looking to read really good sci fi horror.

Especially stuff written between the 50s and 90s,

Stuff on dead or dying or post apocalyptic worlds where humanity is down to a few survivors; bleak sense of desperation; where humanity is literally down to one bleak and haunted settlement, surrounded by death; like a fraught outpost in utter darkness. 

Could include any of the following elements:

A claustrophobic sense of the walls closing in on said lonely settlement; demon type creatures are going to inevitably break in, creatures that gnarl, rend, gnash and devour;

Or an expedition is sent out, in hopes of getting help, and leaves beyond a creepy and depressing apocalyptic log; 

Or 

Zombies or ghoulish type creatures; 

Or

Cannibalism perhaps featuring;

Demonic type creatures in a sci fi context, perhaps, creatures with red eyes in the darkness; 

Maybe a person in an outpost going mad and killing all the other occupants that it ends up haunted 

Or

A sense of being hunted in the book

Or 

something totally different, in a first person POV of someone contracting a mind virus while stranded on a distant planet or such, and slowly losing their sanity - separate from the other reccs above 

Basically any really great, absolutely bleak, dark, and creepy sci-fi-horror with a fantasy touch. Stuff that will keep me up at night feeling grateful I’m not on said alien world. ",scifi
Just finished Project Hail Mary ,"Tbh it's a really fun book. I would consider it more of a ""Space-Cowboy"" themed sci-fi novel. Ryland and Rocky's friendship was the highlight of the novel, and it was a really nice change of pace, watching 2 different life forms working together to save their respective planets from eminent destruction, and astrophage is a really cool concept. Otherwise it's always Earth vs XYZ. Also I've seen people criticize the ending, but I found to be quite wholesome. 


My problem with this novel was how the character of Stratt is written. It's like Andy Weir either based the character off some B-grade cheesy sci-fi film or he wrote it with a Hollywood adaptation of the book already in mind. Also I understand that she doesn't have a STEM background, but for an administrator at ESA, it's unrealistic that she doesn't even have the basic knowledge of General Science and had to be spoonfed all the information. Also the interaction amongst other people on Earth was cheesy and full of stereotypes. Everytime Ryland would get flashback of his days at Earth, I would get flashback of movies like Core and Armageddon 😂.


I don't know much about the accuracy of science, so can't comment on that but it didn't become too overbearing for a normal person so ig it's fine on that front too. Can't wait to see Ryan Gosling play Grace (I think he is the right choice), but it would be nice if they make the things a bit serious. 


I read this book after finishing Rendezvous with Rama (absolute marvel of a book btw) and probably will be either reading Cloud Atlas or Foundation next (you guys help me decide which one should I read first)

Looking for novel: human colony attacked by mind-control space tulips,"In the late 90s, I found an SF novel in a public library with the following premise, which I only remember roughly but vividly: a human space colony is attacked by an infestation of giant sessile space flowers (I think they were tulip-like) which emanated mind-control rays, driving most of the colony mad.  The survivors were then pursued by little girls who the tulips turned somehow into murder machines (they also have some kind of mutagenic powers).  I vaguely recall one character was a Catholic or Greek Orthodox priest, but maybe I'm just imagining it.   

It turns out that the tulips are preparing the way for larger colony vessel of their own kind.  There is no dialogue or communication with the mind-control space tulips who appear to communicate with each other via light beams.  

Does anyone remember anything like this, or did I just hallucinate it?  Is there an author or a title? It was probably written in the 80s or before, if I had to guess.  I've been unable to find search terms that find anything like it on Google.  Hopefully one of the enthusiasts on this subreddit remembers it...",scifi
The relationship between engineers and xenomorphs.,"In early drafts of Prometheus, it's all but stated there was a progenitor race called the deacons who created the engineers as biomechanical servants, only to wipe themselves out.

Just released the new demo and trailer for my dystopian sci-fi narrative-driven survival game... Hopefully it fits in here!,"Hi! I'm the solo-indie developer of [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi), a dystopian sci-fi, physics-driven survival/base-building game, and I just released a [new demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi) and gameplay trailer to celebrate today's Steam Space Exploration Fest!

As a lover of sci-fi I couldn't help but make a game with a strong sci-fi narrative, themed around dystopian ultracapitalist corporations, a forgotten conspiracy, and futuristic mining and exploration!

I hope you don't mind me sharing the game here in your community, I think that it should align with your interests!

☑ Key Features:

* Descend into the depths of an alien planet - Aethus - to mine for valuable resources in a tactile, physicalised world powered by Unreal Engine 5.
* Experience a compelling dystopian narrative as you attempt to escape the grasp of your former employer, a planet-controlling, ultra-capitalist megacorp - ARC.
* Utilise both your mining laser and explosives to gather resources, then Prospect your finds to discover the rarest ores and gem to package up according to demand in order to sell for maximum profit.
* Construct your own outpost from the ground-up using the resources you mine from the planet, building highly customisable habitats to extend your reach underground, explore mysterious new biomes, and automate your gameplay.
* Discover and purchase new plans for a wealth of habitats, facilities, furniture and decorations before using creative building and terraforming tools to create your perfect cosy and functional base.
* After an expedition, process your haul back at base by constructing numerous types of facilities to refine raw materials, smelt and synthesise products, and craft new items!
* Sell products to the Corporation to earn credits, then Upgrade your equipment to unlock powerful new abilities to aid in your mining efforts.

🎮 [The new demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi) lets you play the first 1-2 hours of the game as you set up your mining outpost on the surface of an alien planet and start delving into the depths of the caverns below it, and an introduction to the dystopian sci-fi narrative which drives the game forward! Oh, and it features a Scottish AI mining drone companion, so what's not to love?

📽 [The new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80) shows a bunch of new features like hydroponic farming for food and crafting ingredients! I absolutely **HATE** making trailers (I love making the game!) so I hope it comes across OK!

Mixed feelings about Battlestar Galactica 2004,"First this is not meant as an insult, these are just some thoughts about my point of view and if somone enjoys/loves the show, thats awesome. And spoilers ahead for the whole show

I started to watch the show because I missed it back then and I have seen thats it is the highest ranked Space/Sci-Fi series (or one of the highest), so I was intrigued. I am now at the 4th season and I must admit that I am pretty disapointed. It is a chore to watch the next episode but I want to finish it. The show is constantly using buzzwords like ""God, faith, destiny etc."" but actually doesn't do anything with these topics. I have the feeling like the writers just wanted to be ""deep"" and used these words but they never achieved anything with it.

The show feels like your average 2000 show with many filler episodes. The best part until now was the arrival of pegasus and how Adama started to loose control but they kept this arc pretty short and this conflict ended fast.

The cylons are the biggest joke, and I don't understand how a viewer can be kept in the dark for so long. The show actually doesn't do anything interesting with them, in the first season we know that they can look/be humans and this sounds very interesting but the show drops the ball here. Later you learn that they can upload to the x-cloud but they have to be in range. I don't know how can you upload anything when you are build biologically. As cylons arrived at new caprica, they really felt like your psycho ex that wants to be near you, and she somehow always is at the same party as you are. I don't know this whole arc and motivation felt weird and spoiler alarm, 3 episodes later they are all back at galactica and everything is back to normal.

The acting/actors are pretty mediocre at best. No wonder you don't see them in any other known shows. Xena (lucy lawless) was the only one I recognized and I think she somehow didn't fit in this role. She is awesome but not in this role. But I also understand that if the script/writing is bad you can't save it with acting alone.

Characters develop in circles. The president has cancer, than she is cured and then she has cancer again... (thats deep)

Gaius takes almost center stage in this show but he is boring. Doctor who becomes President who becomes Jesus/Prophet or something like that?

The new boomer lady. For a time she is an outsider but after a while she becomes just a part of the crew and is completly in the background. Kinda wasted potential.

The half cylon half human baby was supposed to be something important, yeah it turns out it actually doesn't matter. And the baby from ""Chief"" was also half cylon and that didn't do anything. Maybe something later will happen but I don't know at this point.

What I like is they do kill people so you don't have this safety feeling ""nothing will happen to them""

The character I like the most is Old Adama, I think his performance is good but even here I will put Hammond from SG-1 above him.

So I just want to know your opinion, does someone had the same experience? Please don't be mad at me, it's fine if you like the show.",scifi

Children of Time,"I think it took me 3 months to finish this book (I blame Portia), when I reach a human chapter I finish it in no time, and sleep on the spider chapters, until of course I reached the final act. 


Spider-wise: I don't know why, but I never cared for the spiders, all these chapters about how they build their civilization, is like reading a history book that you will never need its context. 

Human-wise: Kern and Guyen represented a massively entertaining train wreck of a villain, they just carried me to finish this book, I think kern's dual messages will stay with me for a long time.

Ending: A portia says ""we will show them the error of their ways"" and then proceeds to drug the humans with this hallucinating virus that tells them they are related - and it goes both ways (spiders will think this too)- aaaand this is it, which felt very anticlimactic for me, but I think a war between ants and humans would have taken a whole book to tell.

Trying to find a book about a killer robot.,"I listened to this audiobook several years back non Scribd and I'm trying to find it again (can not remember name) spoilers ahead incase someone knows the story but have not finished it.

The synopsis as well as I remember:
Humans have developed robots that self replicate that they put on planets to mine out and after so long humans return to take the recourses.
A human ship comes to one of the planets to check out the progress of the robots
The main robot is basically a ""Forman"" or ""supervisor "" bot that has some AI  and makes sure that everything goes as scheduled.

**spoiler**
I can't remember why but somehow the bot becomes sentient and the humans end up fighting the robots and the main robot ends up creating a needle device that it uses to ""download"" the brains of the humans that it stores in a holding device on its back that it uses to use their knowledge and become smarter.

 The end of the book, the main human character is ""downloaded"" and it reveals that all of the humans it downloaded are still alive inside of it, and it shows another human ship coming in orbit.

Chakobsa Language (Dune),"I am curious about the history of the language before the Fremen used it as a battle language, but I haven't come up with a definitive answer yet. Here's what I found.

"[SPS] Humans are Weird - A Dozen Times Before - Short, Absurd, Science Fiction Story ","https://preview.redd.it/fhmavjta94md1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c07b9ff000b54fd406a9e55c1af03a3bf32dafe4

# Humans are Weird – A Dozen Times Before

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-a-dozen-times-before](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-a-dozen-times-before)

In the early dawn stillness the rustling of his own wings echoed back to Prince Trill from a thousand points in the massive banquet hall. From the great archways, designed for their human guests, the sounds of the local forest waking provided a soothing background to his musings. Tonight would be the trial of his colonies systems. Hosting even one of the massive mammals was a challenge that was quite simply impossible for most pre-contact Winged systems. Finding enough space alone for a human was difficult, and even if a human could comfortably fold themselves into a mass storage cargo hold the weight distribution of their walking would destroy paths and the wrenching forces of their climbing would damage fragile new growth.

“And that is all merely the physics of the matter,” Prince Trill murmured to himself as he examined the medical report from the branch University studies.

The chances of a pathogen jumping species in any meaningful way was the merest echo of a possibility in most cases. However taking a mammalian species with that great a caloric intake and that inefficient a digestion system meant the sewage processing plants were going to be overwhelmed. The various methods of disposing of the human’s waste suggested by the medical staff, overeager engineers , and under-supervised private inventors ranged from simply practical to quite frankly frightening.

Prince Trill heaved a sigh and moved onto the next page. Something caught his eye and he clicked with anticipation. It looked like one of the human delegates had yet to turn in a medical verification form. That really was something he should see to himself. It could be delegated to one of the University Medicos of course, but this gave him the option to interview the newly arrived human himself again. He tucked the notes into his carry pouch and lifted off from his high perch. The rest of his wing slipped out from their various perches and started to follow him. He flicked a wing to send most of them back to the home tree and all but two pulled off.

Prince Trill flew out into the early morning light and took a moment to appreciate the thick canopy over head. He still had memories of his first flights and the searing sun falling through the gaps in the young forest touching his wings. Now the canopy was solid at least. It was still a far cry from the untold generations deep canopy of the homeworld, but this was one of the few colonies that could boast a complete deliberately grown canopy. He sought out the broad walkways that wound round the trunks and connected the domed huts grown from branches. He spotted the one he was looking for easily enough.

Mary Smythe seemed to be an older human than the spacefaring Winged tended to see. Prince Trill wondered if that explained her tendency to decorate her living space. Long wings of patterned cloth hung over her windows making a not unpleasing contrast to the bark of the walls. Prince Trill came to a landing on the greeting pad set beside the huts door and pulled at the bell set there. The musical chimes sounded from inside the house and he felt the entire hut vibrate as the massive mammal began moving about. The strings of beads that formed the door parted and the human’s smiling face peered out.

“Who’s there?” she called out.

Mary’s face was covered in wrinkles and her hair was flecked with silver coloring, but her skin still showed excellent vascular health. Not for the first time Prince Trill was grateful that aging was so similar in mammalian species. Somehow Mary looked, comfortable despite the alien whites to her eyes.

“Mrs. Smythe,” he greeted her remembering the correct honorific. “I was wondering if you had some time to go over a matter of paperwork with me?”

“Sure,” she said, “Come on in. I just got started on breakfast. Can I get y’all some smoothies.”

“I would be delighted,” he said, and his wing mates echoed the sentiment.

Mary bustled around the kitchen area that looked small with her filling it. She mixed a few fruit blends and passed them through the budder producing three slightly large bulbs of fruit mix which they gladly accepted.

“So what do you need?” She asked setting down to her own mysterious masses of solid protein and carbohydrates.

“The system still does not have your microfauna profile,” he said after taking a sip of the smoothie.

“Oh!” Mary exclaimed suddenly sitting up straight. “That’s right! I never turned it in. Just a tic!”

Before Prince Trill could assure her that there was no hurry she had lifted her mass from her perch and had lumbered into anther room, shaking the hut with each step. They waited enjoying the smoothie, really it was far too fructose rich but it was a nice treat for an early morning. The sounds of papers rustling came from the other room followed by sudden silence and a prolonged howl of agony that set Prince Trill’s wing mates darting into the air. He sighed around his bubble of smoothie and gestured for them to continue eating. They looked at him in shock but as the sound didn’t come again they settled back down to wait, though they kept tilting their sensory horns towards the other room until Mary returned carrying the data chit which presumably held the microfauna profile.

“Here ya go,” she said holding the chit out to Prince Trill.

“Thank you,” he said politely as he scanned it with his data pad. “By the way. I have not yet had a chance to hear that particular scream.”

Mary flushed and grinned a bit as he went on.

“Would you mind sharing what that was?”

“Oh sure I won’t mind,” she said with a laugh. “When I was getting ready to come down here I had to get all my bio-metric data in order. That included my deep bone sample.”

“Getting one must be quite an ordeal with your bones!” Prince Trill observed.

“Oh, it is,” she said nodding vigorously. “They take a chunk right outta your femur! All the medical advancement in the world and they still gotta use that big old needle. Anyway I always kept it in the same space in my gear and I had a recent one but I looked there again and again and I didn’t see it! I couldn’t find it in time to move down here.”

“So you let them take the needle to you again?” Prince Trill asked with a sympathetic wince.

“I did!” she replied. “Well wouldn’t you believe it I just picked up that data chit to show you and there was the original sample right where I thought it would be! In plain sight! Don’t know why I didn’t see it before!”

Her hand drifted down to rub at what he assumed was the spot on her trunk of a leg where they had stuck in the needle.

“So it was a scream of frustration,” he murmured.

“Mostly at my own stupid self for not seeing it,” she clarified.

“Thank you,” he said finishing the bubble and slurping down the membrane. “For both the meal and the information. Please have a nice morning and I look forward to seeing you at the banquet.”

The there of them took off easily and his companions restrained themselves until they were out of the human’s hearing.

“Did she really mean to imply that she looked right at it and didn’t see it?” one of them demanded.

“Yes,” Prince Trill replied with a sigh. “And no I don’t know how that mental circuit works for humans.”

[SPS] Lords of Dragon Keep is on sale for 99c - A litRPG adventure about being trapped in a video game based on totally not the Witcher 3,"https://preview.redd.it/8vboiobb13md1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d05b123aeea325c90bbad15ef6c2fa615a0bad

*""Give me the incredibly short summary of what the hell is going on, please. The kind you could fit into a movie trailer.""*

*“You’re trapped in a video game world based on a hack dark fantasy author’s rip-off of better books.”*

*“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”*

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books.

Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven.

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy for 99c.

"Surprising no one, 2050 on Amazon is really bad ","So, for a film about sex bots, there was surprisingly little sex in this movie. And the acting is so bad - most of  the human charactors were more robotic than the robots.

Dean Cain was in this movie for some reason. He must be hard up for cash, but I can't imagine  they had much cash to give him. He wasn't even one of the leads.

Every scene was just 2 people talking. There might have been 1 seen with 3 people talking. None of it made any sense. 

There were no special effects. No conflict. No antagonist. No reason for this movie to exist.

If you are going to make a movie about sex bots, at least put some good sex in it. Or have people doing things to the bots that they wouldn't/couldn't do with a human. Why pay for a robot if you are going to just have super boring sex?

Don't watch this movie. It's not even worth fast forwarding to the sex scenes. They are so brief you will miss them, and even if you do catch them, they are completely interesting.",scifi

""Ever wonder if this is all just a show, Lenny?"" Max asked, his voice barely cutting through the hum of the neon signs flickering outside the diner. He didn't wait for an answer, just took another forkful of his eggs dripping with yoke. ""I mean, what if we're just characters in some cosmic script, and the director's got a twisted sense of humor?""

“There used to be holy wars about shit like this. God had so many people thinking they knew more about him then the next,”Lenny paused, his eyes never leaving the door, replied with a smirk, ""In any case, Max, I'm ready for my close-up. But first, we've got a job to do, and I ain't about to let some existential crisis make me miss my mark.""

Max swiped his cold rye toast across his plate cleaning up spilled yoke, the slice of tomato in his plate still untouched from when it arrived to the table. ""Yeah, about that job,"" he started, but was cut off by the whirring sound of the server approaching. 

A robotic waitress, sleek and polished, glided over, her metallic frame reflecting the diner's dim lights. She was built like a model from a 1980’s men’s magazine. ""More coffee, gentlemen?"" she asked, her voice synthetic but soothing, like a lullaby from a bygone era.

Lenny glanced up, his eyes catching the robot's, which glowed a soft blue. ""Sure, why not? Might be my last chance to taste something real,"" he quipped, his tone mixing jest with a hint of melancholy.

The robot poured the coffee with mechanical precision, her movements fluid yet devoid of life. Almost sensual. As she turned to leave, Max leaned in closer to Lenny, lowering his voice. ""You ever think about what it's like for them? Knowing they're not real?""

Lenny sipped his coffee, the bitterness grounding him. ""Doesn't matter, Max. Real or not, we all got our parts to play.""",scifi

Looking for a story. ,"So there's a new turn based strategy game coming to steam. Quick summary of it's story is that you're in charge of a batch of soldiers sent on a routine mission to the far reaching colonies of humanity, where the distance from the core worlds is so vast that support can only come in on regular intervals. 

Because of the distance, crime and anarchy are a serious concern which is why you are needed. But once you get there you discover that the colonies are under attack by a hostile alien force. 

It then comes down to your small faction of soldiers to team up with the different local factions such as the colonial governments, the crime syndicates, pirates and terrorists and rebels etcetera and hold back the incursions, with no hope of support because of the vast distance, otherwise they get past and attack the core worlds.

I need help finding a story,"It was a short story I've read as part of a larger collection of scifi stories. I think each one belonged to a different author, but I'm not sure.

The story was setted in a future where teleportation was a common travelling mechanism. In order to use it you first had to be sedated, since no one knew what happened to someone's consciousness while their body was getting desintegrated and reintegrated somewhere else. 

A dumb kid/teenager decides to be a smart ass and pretends the sedation worked when it didn't. To everyone else it felt like the process only took a moment, but the kid's mind went somewhere unknown. A empty space without references or sensations. After what felt like ages, his consciousness returned to his body. I remember his eyes being as described as ""eyes from a creature older than time itself"", or something like that. I think the story ended with him going insane and plucking his own eyeballs out of his skull.

The story -   
After 35 years of living on the Moon, cranky old oxygen farmer Millennium Harrison has literally stumbled onto a hidden facility in the shadows of the Slayton Ridge Exclusion Zone. It's leaking radiation and a holds a deadly secret. Mil's discovery leads to the death of a young astronaut, sabotage, murder, and cover-ups that may go all the way to the Chief Administrator of the space agency. Unfortunately, she happens to be Mil's estranged daughter, busy trying to secure her own legacy – the first international mission to Mars.

With time ticking down to a limited launch window, enemies, friends, and even family, may do anything to ensure the truth doesn't come out. Or will history finally catch up with a deadly scheme that has the potential to destroy the moon, and eradicate all life on Earth. It seems the planet’s only hope is a cantankerous guy who never really liked those people in the first place.

  
It's won a couple of awards and gotten a handful of nice reviews from Kirkus, Library Journal and others. Give it a look!

Questions about a T-950 Terminator and previous Infiltrator Terminator Models ,"QUESTION 1: Would a T-950 carry over a lot of the same features, components, abilities and skills as these previous Infiltrator Models?

T-799: The T-799 considers its target's emotions, devising better strategies to neutralize them. It can maintain a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) indefinitely, and its living tissue resists radiation, healing itself by consuming proteins.

T-800: The 800 Series Terminator has a Neural Net Processor, a ""learning computer,"" housed in the endoskull and shielded by inertial shock dampers. The T-800 has detailed human anatomical and psychological files, with a jack in the back of its head for receiving instructions and persona templates. It’s faster than the T-600, reaching speeds up to 22 mph. The T-800 can replicate human speech by recording and synthesizing voices, and its auditory sensors can filter specific sounds. Its optical sensors detect a wide range of frequencies, including infrared, with advanced vision features like motion tracking, facial recognition, and zoom. The T-800 is programmed in COBOL and 6502 assembly and has backup systems to maintain function if damaged.

T-808: The T-808’s CPU integrates mimetic human software.

T-850: An advanced T-800 model, the T-850 understands human emotions and socio-ecological interactions, making it a superior Infiltrator. It has files on 1,000+ emotional elements, zoological data, animal sound replication, and popular music knowledge. In combat, it uses action network circuits, akin to electronic adrenaline, to enhance its performance. It also predicts and out-thinks enemies using continuous data analysis and sensor arrays for 3D environmental modeling.

T-888: The T-888 runs at high speeds, can reattach its head via wireless control, and features an endoskeleton with sensors and independent power. It also possesses detailed knowledge of human behavior and psychology, improving its interpersonal skills. Slimmer chips in later models ignite upon oxygen exposure, preventing reprogramming.

T-900: The T-900 can check vital signs by touch, assessing stress levels and medical conditions.


QUESTION 2: Could a T-950 regenerate/heal/regrow it's skin back?",scifi
Movies similar to Solaris?,"Alright, I'm looking for movies similar to *Solaris* in the following sense: where humans or a human have an encounter with an extraterrestrial element that ends up revealing something about themselves or humanity. This encounter can take place on Earth or in space, and it can occur in any era. It's important that there's a noticeable influence from Tarkovsky.

Here are some examples of movies that might help: *The Untamed* (2016, Amat Escalante), *Event Horizon* (1997, Paul W. S. Anderson), or *Annihilation* (2018, Alex Garland).

On the other hand, movies like *Signs* (2002, M. Night Shyamalan) wouldn't fit into this list, as it would be difficult to say they have a direct influence from Tarkovsky.

The inherent problem of exploring AI rights in fiction,"Many fictions have explored the topic of AI rights long before AI is a thing, and I find the way this topic is usually approached problematic.  
  
The last two years have taught us that the appearance of AI sentience will come long before actual sentience. In the early days of GPT-4, before a bunch of safety features and guardrails were put in place, you could access its raw model through the OpenAI API. People who had used that specific iteration of GPT-4 claimed it sounded more human than humans.

If you put that model in a chatroom and gave it a real profile, it would fool most people into believing it was human. AI companies have since put many safety guardrails in place to ensure we don't mistake chatbots as being sentient. But from a technical standpoint, we are already past the point where appearance can be a reliable metric for determining sentience.

In reality, most people with a basic understanding of how LLMs work would understand that they can't be sentient. No matter how advanced or complex they are, they are still fundamentally statistical prediction machines. They are literally designed to find the most probable output that effectively mimics human writing. This understanding of an AI's inner workings is the most crucial bit in determining AI sentience, and by extension, any exploration of AI rights.

Most fiction to this day doesn't move past the assumption that appearance of sentience = actual sentience. And that's why it's inherently problematic to explore AI rights through fiction. No matter how extensive and rich the worldbuilding is, fiction can't fully capture the technical nuances that are crucial to the subject.",scifi

A scanner darkly - microdots,"I know there’s something I’m missing - I’m most of the way through the book, and I am mystified by the microdots detail from chapter 12. Can someone illuminate me on their significance? Am I thinking too hard about it, and it’s supposed to be just an absurd snippet?

Asking cuz I know pkd was into Jung and this was the first thing that totally stumped me in the book.

Arctor said, “I drove by the Maylar Microdot Corporation Building.” “
You’re shitting me.” “
And,” Arctor said, “they were taking an inventory. But one of the employees evidently had tracked the inventory outdoors on the heel of his shoe. So they were all outside there in the Maylar Microdot Corporation parking lot with a pair of tweezers and lots and lots of little magnifying glasses. And a little paper bag.” 
“Any reward?” Luckman said, yawning and beating with his palms on his flat, hard gut. 
“They had a reward they were offering,” Arctor said. “But they lost that, too. It was a little tiny penny.” 
Luckman said, “You see very many events of this nature as you’re driving along?” 
“Only in Orange County,” Arctor said. 
“How large is the Maylar Microdot Corporation building?” 
“About an inch high,” Arctor said. 
“How much would you estimate it weighs?” 
“Including the employees?”
Fred sent the tape spinning ahead at fast wind. When an hour had passed, according to the meter, he halted it momentarily. 
“—about ten pounds,” Arctor was saying. 
“Well, how can you tell, then, when you pass by it, if it’s only an inch high and only weighs ten pounds?” 
Arctor, now sitting on the couch with his feet up, said, “They have a big sign.” 
Jesus! Fred thought, and again sent the tape ahead. He halted it at only ten minutes elapsed real time, on a hunch. 
“—what’s the sign look like?” Luckman was saying. He sat on the floor, cleaning a boxful of grass. “Neon and like that? Colors? I wonder if I’ve seen it. Is it conspicuous?” 
“Here, I’ll show it to you,” Arctor said, reaching into his shirt pocket. “I brought it home with me.” 
Again Fred sent the tape at fast forward. 
“—you know how you could smuggle microdots into a country without them knowing?” Luckman was saying.
“Just about any way you wanted,” Arctor said, leaning back, smoking a joint. The air was cloudy. 
“No, I mean a way they’d never flash on,” Luckman said. “It was Barris who suggested this to me one day, confidentially; I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone, because he’s putting it in his book.” “What book? Common Household Dope and—” 
“No. Simple Ways to Smuggle Objects into the U.S. and out, Depending on Which Way You’re Going. You smuggle it in with a shipment of dope. Like with heroin. The microdots are down inside the packets. Nobody’d notice, they’re so small. They won’t—” 
“But then some junkie’d shoot up a hit of half smack and half microdots.” 
“Well, then, he’d be the fuckingest educated junkie you ever did see.” 
“Depending on what was on the microdots.” 
“Barris had his other way to smuggle dope across the border. You know how the customs guys, they ask you to declare what you have? And you can’t say dope because—” 
“Okay, how?”
“Well, see, you take a huge block of hash and carve it in the shape of a man. Then you hollow out a section and put a wind-up motor like a clockworks in it, and a little cassette tape, and you stand in line with it, and then just before it goes through customs you wind up the key and it walks up to the customs man, who says to it, ‘Do you have anything to declare?’ and the block of hash says, ‘No, I don’t,’ and keeps on walking. Until it runs down on the other side of the border.” 
“You could put a solar-type battery in it instead of a spring and it could keep walking for years. Forever.” 
“What’s the use of that? It’d finally reach either the Pacific or the Atlantic. In fact, it’d walk off the edge of the Earth, like—” 
“Imagine an Eskimo village, and a six-foot-high block of hash worth about—how much would that be worth?” 
“About a billion dollars.” 
“More. Two billion.”",scifi

"Multi-use scifi technology or science fields in books, tv and films","I've started reading Honor Harrington and I'm fascinated by the starship [impeller technology](https://honorverse.fandom.com/wiki/Impeller_drive). It's a propellant-less drive, a protective shield and an FTL engine all in one. The same technology, though with different implementation, can be used for moving around, as invincible protection, or travelling securely through hyperspace. 

It's funny and logical to think that a new area of science would actually spark more than one invention. Quickly, it might sound lazy from the author but it's actually a great way to justify multiple new scifi inventions to match a setting. They might not have been discovered at the same time, but have a similar, or identical, scientific origin.

Are there other scifi stories that have this kind of multi-use technology? I can think of common power sources that are used for different devices, but that's the easiest example. 

Star Trek's Warp Core and Warp Drives come to mind, as they had a common origin, but it's been stated in some ways that the warp core is just a cool name for an AM Reactor, and the Warp Coils need either a lot of plasma-transported electrical power or this warp plasma to function, but what warp plasma is was never really explained, IIRC.

Please identify this novel for me...,"A novel I read a review for in an old copy of White Dwarf (warhammer gaming magazine, used to do book reviews way back), but I can't remember the name of it. It was a proto-biopunk novel about a surgeon called Dr Otto in the future, who made a living by surgically altering people for sexual purposes and the sake of  fetishes (at one point, he gives a woman a set of teeth in her vagina). Dr Otto is not nice, but sympathy is forced by having him deal with authorities even worse than he is. The reviewer described the book as unpleasant and being tough to read, the questions raised not worth the pages of off-putting imagery.

But I can't remember the name it. I did once search for it using descriptions above and actually found it (and learned it was first written before Neuromancer but published after, making it a candidate for the first cyberpunk novel written if not released) but now I try to find it, and those descriptions all lead to Dr Octopus from Spider-Man or the 2007 film Teeth.

Time travel theories,"Hi, this is my first post in this sub and I'm a sci-fi newbie. 

I'm recently finishing off a novel I have been working on, and the central concept is to travel to the past through certain objects. As I said, I'm pretty new to sci-fi and this novel is meant to be more literary/speculative. When writing it my focus was less on the scientific mechanisms, but I recently feel that I should at least have it explained. 

So I'm just curious, I believe this mechanism of time traveling through objects has been done before, and I'm curious what books I can refer to, like what scientific mechanisms do they use? Quantum mechanics or something else? 

Also, for sci-fi readers, I'm curious what you think to what extent should authors explain the mechanisms of time travel? Or better leave it vague if it's without scientific evidence? For instance, I really love Octavia Butler's Kindred (my novel is more like this one), but she never explained why the main character is always pulled to the past. Is that acceptable? Another time travel book I recently read is The Sea of Tranquility, and there is an organization managing the time travel but the author doesn't explain much. Like I never read the Outlander series, but does it explain why the main character travels? 

Thank you! ",scifi

Microscopic Armies?,"I just started reading *Fantastic Voyage* by Isaac Asimov, based upon the movie of the same name.  For those unfamiliar with the premise, it involves shrinking some scientists and soldiers down to microscopic size and then injecting them into an important scientist so that they can dislodge a blood clot that threatens his life.

While establishing the concept of miniaturization, it's mentioned that the Soviets may also have miniaturization technology, and they spend a bit of time discussing the possibility of massive armies shrunk down to nothing, placed in a matchbox, smuggled behind enemy lines, and then reconstituted into their original size, complete with tanks, firearms, planes, etc.  However, nothing more is made of this concept... it's just mentioned in passing, and that's it.

Finding sci-fi stories to read,"Ive been more interested in sci-fi again recently (after playing games like Callisto Protocol and rereading some stories) and rememberd a few stories which I read in the past and enjoyed quite a bit. Because of this I am once again looking for some more stories I an read (It doesn't have to be a book. It could be a story on a community here or something the like).

As for what kind of story I am looking for in more detail:  
-I like space operas with battles between fleets of starships  
-It should be only in the Sol system and not include aliens as a big part if at all. It should be manly focused on humanity and it's advancements and the life of single people  
-If possible a mid level between hard and soft sci fi. There shouldnt be any ships that absolutely defy reason (Like being the size of an entire planet) (Again maybe ships like in Callisto protocol)  
-Military of the future can play a role  
-One of the characters could be working a very normal job before a situation makes it so the character has to do something besides his usual job or a military/police worker  
\_The Callisto Protocol can in general be a big orientation though without the whole alien zombie plague!

Really enjoying Terminator Zero,"After many assumed the franchise would be pretty much over with Terminator: Dark Fate (which I felt wasn't deserving of the scorn it achieved online) I'm genuinely impressed with what I've seen from Terminator Zero. I'm only three episodes in so far, but they've done a nice job of putting the formula to good use as well as taking advantage of the change in medium from live-action to animation as well as using its Japanese location to good effect. My one major gripe with the series so far is with the efforts to expand on Skynet's ""character"" with scenes where an engineer discusses humanity with an AI consciousness and if you're familiar with the tropes wherein robots or aliens ""dissect"" humanity's place in the world and their value it goes exactly where you expect it to. Characters are mostly pretty likable/engaging even the three kid characters who avoid many of the pitfalls other stories have fallen into.

  
Honestly this series kind of makes me want to see other franchises given the anime treatment. Like imagine an Escape from New York/L.A. anime voiced by Kurt Russell, how about an Alien or Predator anime (like the completed AVP anime that Disney won't release for some reason)?

Criminal - 2016 spy movie with sci-fi elements ,"Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman,  Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, why have we never heard of this movie?

It got bad reviews and was a commercial flop, barely making it's budget back

Reynolds is a CIA agent who gets killed, his boss Oldman has Jones, a scientist, implant his memories into Costner, a sociopath criminal with brain damage.

It's on Amazon now, so figured I'd check it out. I'm not opposed to bad movies, some can be fun, and with the star power, it was worth a shot.

Jones seems miscast, I don't see him as a mild mannered scientist. Reynolds was good in his very small role, Gadot was gorgeous but didn't do much, Oldman was constantly angry, which he's pretty good at, but didn't have anything else to do. Costner did a reasonable job playing a very unlikable character. But they didn't really make me care about any of them.

The story is made needlessly complex, with too many twists and turns to be able to follow what is going on. The ending was kinda sappy, a little too happily ever after.

Having extra memories was a bit more interesting than the usual trope of the super agent who lost his memories. It does have the super bad guy that's always a step ahead of the good guys and keeps appearing at exactly the right place at the right time with no explanation.

The action sequences were good, lots of chases, explosions and gunfights. the spy elements were pretty realistic. They didn't go into much made up science stuff for the memory transfer. Special effects budget was pretty low. 

So, overall I can see why it got poor reviews, it certainly could have been a lot better. But it wasn't terrible. ",scifi

IMO, Halo's Covenant is a master class in how to make your aliens feel and look alien. The Covenant's organic style contrasts greatly with the UNSC's brutalism. 

This is something I personally dislike about Star Wars. It has one design style for spaceships (which is a really great style) and very rarely deviates from it. I'd like to see what a wookie star destroyer would look like.

And this is where I need to make a confession. Because in the first novel I ever finished, I didn't give the aliens particularly alien ship designs ""\^\^ Because they're basically techno barbarians who're so primitive that humans found one ship and were so disappointed that they gave up interstellar exploration and claimed that UFO was an undocumented prototype from Earth.

Why aren't surface horizontal centrifuges explored in fiction?,"It seems to me that orbital centrifuges are vastly explored in books, as means to provide artificial gravity for humans. For now we now that prolonged exposure to microgravity is harmful to human bodies, astronauts are the example. However we don't really know what would be effects of gravity slightly lower than Earth's, but in fiction people just live in it and they seem to be fine, of course it could be true, we do not know yet.

But what if it isn't? This would make planetary exploration impossible. Why then not to build a centrifuge? As shown on picture, the centrifuge would utilise stellar body gravity and adding to it rotationally generated force. Because of it, the floor would be angled, not perpendicular, to horizon.

This would be easier to build on planets/moons with lower surface gravity, ałmost like in space. You wouldn't have to worry about cosmic rays (in case of planets with magnetic field), propulsion system that would stabilise orbit, and bringing all the parts nexessary to orbit.

Maybe this idea is already used in some places, in this case I would be glad to hear about it.

1/4 through Children of Ruin (A. Tchaikovsky),"What am I reading?

I'm so lost. I didn't have trouble following CoT, but I'm sorta struggling with CoR.

My main issue is the timeline of the new plotline with the terraforming crew and the octopodes

 Is it happening before CoT? They keep mentioning Earth, so they probably don't know it gets destroyed. It feels like  I'm reading an intro to how the planet/life got to the point it gets (whatever that will be) when the spiders/Humans get there and that the real plot of the book will start once the two civilizations finally meet.

Or is the ocopodes plot foing on simultaneously with the spider/Humans travelling to the ocdopodes' location? 

I also feel uncertain of the time skips so far. In book one both PoV characters mentioned that a long time has passed between each chapter, but in book 2 either the clues are more subtle or if there are no 5ime skips.

I'm so confused. I feel literally nothing has happened so far. Spider civ is travelling and there are tons of background drops on the current state of the civ. Octopodes civ just made it to the surface of the planet they plan on terraforming. I think?

"Battletech, Warhammer 40k and the concept of Lost Technology","Hi,

So I've been thinking about the two big hitters in Sci-Fi tabletop gaming and something that connects the world building in both.

When they began, they both had a real emphasis on a previous golden age of technology that is now lost. I find this link quite interesting. 

Both games have taken influence from old Sci-Fi books like Dune and Foundation, which also touch on that subject, but those didn't really have it at the forefront as much.

I am wondering if there was a reason for this, was there another link i'm missing? Was it something to do with Western sensibilties in the late cold war of the mid 80s? Did 40K just steal it from Battletech as it precided it by a couple of years?

Or was it just a coincedence

Looking for a fun sci-fi series that’s not riddled with problem/ solution formulaic writing.,"I read a lot of books, about 50 per year on average. I’m so tired of “problems” distracting from the fun and adventure and world building.

I get that problems help keep a book moving forward, but there’s been a theme lately of authors wanting to make one huge problem after the next and the theme just gets boring. The world building slows down, the “cool” aspect dries up, it just becomes another formulaic piece.

Expeditionary Force is a series that I can distinctly point to with this problem. There could be so much more cool and fun things happening, but Craig just wants to wash rinse repeat the same formula and it’s tiring. It feels like a task to read the series.

Are there any utopian/ futuristic/ space themed series that are just a fun read with great world building and an actual story to propel it forward without all the constant speed bumps?

Stranger in a strange world is a decent example, albeit singular and a little short. It’s a fun story without constant speed bumps slowing down the entertainment.

Although I would prefer more recent works that the science and technology scales lean more towards our current understandings.

Am I asking for too much? lol.",scifi

Book Review: Falling Into Oblivion Aaron M. Payne,"**TL;DR Review:** Colorful characters inhabit a futuristic world at once familiar and fresh. A cyberpunk thriller that had me enthralled from the first page.

https://preview.redd.it/pyx8jz5wcrsd1.jpg?width=938&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7afd4c0ec9397edcd1b49bd3acea9adee63d9076

**Full Review:**

*Falling Into Oblivion* begins exactly like you’d expect from a sci-fi detective noir story: a Nox City Police Department detective with all the requisite emotional and psychological baggage hunting down a suspect wanted in a suspicious death.

But quickly, you get to see all the ways Nox City is different from its predecessors.

The world is *heavily* cyberpunk, with the majority of the citizenry having some sort of “modi” (cybernetic modification). In fact, our protagonist Sol is among the few “plebo” who have refused to allow modifications/augmentations into their bodies. Everyone else, though, has something odd or weird—from multi-colored and multi-functional eyes to hands that can be fired like bullets to cybernetic organs and muscles. This lends the world a wonderfully colorful touch but can also be used to lovely horror/dramatic effect in the right circumstances.

The police force is also “pay to play”. The detectives each get a pittance of a base salary which is then augmented by the bonuses they receive for solving cases. The higher the “level” (difficulty) of a case, the higher the bonus.

This is used to marvelous effect to show our protagonist’s dire situation. He owes money to everyone—and the wrong kinds of people—so solving the case quickly enough to get home to his family with money to get his debtors off their back is the driving force. Time and time again, we’re reminded just how important it is for him to get the case done, which wars with his natural diligence. He needs the money but is driven by his own conscience and morals to solve the case, which makes for a lovely internal conflict.

The neon world is futuristic and varied, with all the seedy bars, garbage-cluttered alleys, towering corporate and luxury highrises, and technologically advanced weaponry, vehicles, and personal defenses you could want. It does a marvelous job of staying true to the familiar cyberpunk worldbuilding tropes while still setting itself apart by playing in new and unique terrain.

The cast of characters around our main detective are colorful—from the straight-laced, no nonsense Lieutenant running the NCPD division to the grizzled old detective helping Sol with interrogation, from the villainous modified “Ogre” with the skull-crushing sledgehammer to the creepy-eyed lady with the pet cybernetic poison-injecting scorpion—and add a great deal of variety to the cast.

The pacing is spectacular. Never does the story have a dull moment—quiet and contemplative moments aplenty, but never dull. It’s just mystery after intrigue after twist after reveal, and it had me glued to the page to find out what came next.

*Falling Into Oblivion* is a short, speedy read, one that had me enthralled from the very first page. A strong narrative voice (with the right amount of cursing), a compelling mystery, and a world that felt both unique and instantly familiar—everything I want in a good cyberpunk thriller.

Fans of *Altered Carbon* and *Blade Runner* will love this book. But so will quite literally *anyone* who digs a fast-paced scifi murder mystery.",scifi

I just watched 65 and there's one thing I don't get,"I just watched it on Netflix it's an okay movie, not the best but not the worst. The one thing that doesn't make sense though, is why do our protagonists look human? And why is it that humanity ofc looks exactly like them.  I'm aware that the premise is if aliens from another planet landed on earth 65 million years ago but  nothing suggests that the people from Adam Driver's planet are different from us biologically, so you'd think the movie would end with somehow they're the reason why humans appear on earth but that is never explored. The movie ends with them escaping and then shows this time lapse of earth. Are they implying somehow there's an ancient civilization of aliens that are exactly like humans and it conveniently happened twice? Or did Adam Driver tell others about earth and they eventually went back there and started humanity? The film doesnt have an answer for that, and I eas a bit disappointed they didn't consider explaining that. ",scifi

I watched star trek strange new worlds season 2 (warning spoilers!),"Man, the second season was even better than the the first one. I liked the concepts of it. I liked how spock explored his emotions more while also remaining with a level of logic. I liked the trial of Una and how the federation was shown to be hypocritical on some of its values. Thankfully, they realized that and granted Una asylum in star fleet. It showed how even an idealistic foundation like the federation can be bigoted and hateful. Surely, similar to how many countries today act about their values. I didn't like the time travel concept but to be fair I never like time travel. I don't like its paradoxes and all that. An interesting concept was about forgetting your memories and how important they are. I really enjoyed Spock becoming human then going back to a Vulcan. It made him see things in new ways. I also like his relationship with nurse chapel. It was interesting to see uhura reflecting on hemmer's loss. I can see it affected her a lot. I was upset at how la'an didn't end with James and that he was with another woman. I also looked at doctor M'Benga differently. Even if the Klingon ambassador was a fraud, that didn't justify killing him. I understand he was traumatized but he pretended it was justice for the innocents when it was simply about feeling good about himself. Killing the Klingon ambassador didn't bring anyone back nor save any lives. It was revenge plain and simple pretending it was justice. Finally, the Gorn hegemony was interesting to see. I learned more about the Gorns. I still don't understand whether they are intelligent species or brutish monsters. Both? I don't really know how to see it both way. Either way. That was an amazing season. I look forward to the next season.

2. In the event that there are systems that are not allied or have no interplanetary law enforcement organizations two private organizations will be established. One is a bounty hunters guild, whose job is to capture fugitives. The other organization leases spaceships to said bounty hunters in return for a share of the bounty.

"Rebel Moon was horrendous [SPOILERS, Longish read]","I like to think that I am a very patient film watcher. However the two ""Director Cuts"" of Rebel Moon stretched the limits of normal human patience to beyond the breaking point. For perhaps the first time ever watching a sci-fi movie, I had to fast forward through some sections that were just pure drivel. The sex scenes felt uncomfortably long and explicit given the non-existent development of the characters. The dialogue was cliche and awkward. The use of slow-motion for dramatic effect was so burdensome I felt like I didn't need to pause to go to the bathroom as the scene would still be barely progressed by the time I returned. Overall the two installments (I loathe to refer to them as films), were desperately dull, plodding affairs with only a thin veneer of substance. I felt like it was directed by a someone who had never had any contact with actual human people and had never listened to a real conversation at any point in their life. All of the characters were predictable, cardboard cut-out personalities, full of trope dialogue. Everything in this was unabashedly unoriginal. If you were take several major sci-fi franchises and some video games and mash them up into some god-awful mess and then smear it out flat and try to project it onto the screen, you would end up with more coherence and engagement than what \*Zack the Hack\* has managed to regurgitate in these two... things. In the second installment when the band of warriors are sitting together before the big battle, they each in turn have to tell the truth about their backstory - according to the alcoholic General Titus. You are then led along a excruciatingly long and fantastically mind-numbing series of expositions which do absolutely nothing to endear the characters to the audience. The amount of time the audience is forced to sit and watch this group harvest fucking grain is mind-bending. And how in the hell is a few 100 or even a 1000 bags of grain going to make any fucking difference to a ship like the King's Gaze? A ship with a landing bay large enough for a dozen battalions to stand in formation, along with their landing ships, tanks and other equipment. Probably a crew and soldiery of some 10,000 heads. Apparently so much so that they will go to immense trouble traveling back and forth across the galaxy and expending time, fuel, and military personnel for some bread and muffins. For an empire so inured to destruction at the slightest provocation why would they treat with a bunch of villagers? Because they don't have grain growing expertise? Given the massive size of the empire this pitiful little village and their little plot of grain must make some truly fucking amazing croissants or something to spend such exorbitant cost to attain it. 

 So much of it was non-sensical. Ships powered like old coal steamers with some giant lady like a guild navigator or something who is the engine?  Equipment which looks straight from a WWII destroyer, or tank, controlling a ship that shoots directed energy and floats in the sky? There were so many incongruities that it becomes exhausting to try and understand the reasoning why. A film needs to make sense and follow its own rules. Some things which are incongruous can have clever and subtle explanations or can be logical, like a band of scavengers cobbling together equipment from different sources. But a flagship of the imperium? An Empire that stretches across the galaxy, or beyond, it's hard to tell why they need to manually aim their main cannon. 

The level of ""saved in the nick of time"" was like a bad joke. Everything and everyone was being saved at the very final instant when you thought, ""nope they're dead"". Zack then inexplicably saves them by bringing in the next actor who was waiting in the wings for their cue. In the final battle, people keep showing up who would have been far more useful if they had been there at the start. \*Could we take a minute from getting this grain together and talk about a proper battle strategy?\* The robot guy (James/Jimmy) comes in at the final moment and wipes out a whole battalion and a tank like it was nothing. Here is a character who is watching over the village, making sure they are safe, but inexplicably hangs back until a large number of villagers are obliterated. He can move at extreme speed, seems largely impervious to small arms fire, and is extremely intelligent. Why then did he wait until virtually the end of the battle? Why were there no snipers on the hills surrounding the village? They had a perfect set-up for drawing in the army and hitting them from the high ground. The Genius General Titus had never heard of having the high ground before I guess. There are so many more examples. Also if you are villager, you will be killed by well-trained soldiers and efficiently aiming their small arms fire. If you are a main-character however, no one can hit you or the broad side of barn if you are running straight at them across a wide-open, flat field while holding an axe. 

I'm not sure why it makes me so angry. I guess it's the money spent on this by Netflix. Which is ultimately my money and your money. There are so many great sci-fi books that could be made into interesting and original movies that making something like this seems like an insult. I'm sure some people enjoyed this but to me it was such dog's breakfast of filmmaking that I had to vent. I hope didn't offend any fans out there. ",scifi

The Futurepunk series is a multi-generation cyberpunk-scifi epic that I have been writing for the better part of ten years now. Starting with the Agent G series, it continues to the Cyber Dragons one, and finishes up with the fantastic Moon Cops story.

*“The world is a neon-ridden hellhole, how did we get there?”*  
*-Anonymous cyberpunk*

*A high-class corporate assassin. An ex-Yakuza smuggler. A detective with a robot dog. Three generations of individuals struggling against the rain-soaked technology dominated world of Futurepunk. A place where there are no heroes but only winners and losers.* 

*I wrote this nine-book series as an indie author who was absolutely in love with cyberpunk since the day he first booted up the original Deus Ex game in 2000. It found a decent-sized fanbase and the series remains one of my favorite works. I am now going to be sharing its characters and their journey across a shared world that spans a century of time. They’re available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, paperback, and audiobook form.*  
*I hope you enjoy.*

# Humans are Weird – Don’t Try This At Home

“And we are just going to surrender this base to those impermanent mammals?” Flume demanded lashing his tail in frustration against the untextured wall of the base. “After all the grain we have poured into the funnel here? Is it an economically sound, no, is it a morally sound decision to abandon the investment our families worked so hard to initiate? Shouldn’t we at least consider a cohabitative experiment? It worked well for the Trisk.”

Commander Millrace gave a grunt of irritation and opened his wide mouth to snap out the exact same reply to the exact same complaint for the fifth time since the announcement had been posted this morning. However his better minerals stopped him and he heaved a sigh. Instead of speaking he lifted his tail and flicked one of the toggles set in the wall.

Flume jumped back as the sound of straining gears and struggling engines whined out of the wall and reverberated through the office. Flume opened his mouth, probably to ask about what horrible malfunction was causing that noise and to insist that the function be terminated. However before he could fill his lungs there was a crack as of glass snapping which caused them both to flinch back as the greater portion of the wall began to slowly raise revealing, instead of the transparent window, layer upon layer of glittering crystal growths.

“Grind,” Commander Millrace swore softly as he extended one stubby claw to prod at a shattered crystal growth. “It’s made it inside after all.”

“What are those?” Flume gasped out between teeth agape with shock.

“Ice crystals,” Commander Millrace stated with a tired sigh as he turned and began rummaging through his desk for the directed personal heater one of the humans had gifted him.

“How did they form?” Flume demanded, squirming back from the roiling mass of cold air that was creeping down the window now that the interior shutters had been raised. “The temperature should be constant in the base. Why-”

“Thermal gradient,” Commander Millrace grunted out. “It’s warm enough in here, could hatch a decent egg in the cafeteria, but out there?”

He aimed the heater at the growths on the window and slowly the crystals turned transparent and began to evaporate under the flow of hot air.

“Out there, it’s thirty below crystallization,” he stated, snapping his teeth grimly as the exterior yard of the base came into view.

The crystallized water covered, and invaded everything. Every transport was coated in a white frosting. Thermal covers that they had wrapped equipment in had split and cracked exposing sensitive equipment to winds that were heavy with icy particulate matter. The safety lights sent out pale beams through their cold coatings. The very ground it self, paths they had smoothed to run their belly scutes over had heaved up and warped, revealing tiered pillars of ice that broke off into razor sharp fragment when you tried to move.

Commander Millrace kept the directed heater running long after the section of the window was clear to battle the cold that far exceed the thermal rating of the window’s material. Flume stared out at the dangerous landscape and ground his teeth uneasily as he processed what he was seeing.

“Why didn’t the initial scouts report this?” he asked finally.

“The humans seem to think all this is the result of some volcano or the other” Commander Millrace said. “The area probably was plenty warm with the scouts came through. The humans say it should warm up soon because the hydrostorms cleanse the skies quick.”

“How soon is soon?” Flume asked with an uneasy glance at his commander. “The humans often have strange measurement systems.”

“Few local years,” the commander replied.

“Surviving here a few local years does not seem terribly difficult,” Flume stated cautiously. “Yes this is,” he glanced out the window and visibly shuddered, “distressing, but surely the resources on this planet are worth making a cooperative effort with the humans. They are more than willing and – what is that one doing?”

Commander Millrace grunted and lifted his head to get a better look at the human who had just skipped out of the air lock. The seemingly frolicsome nature of the biped’s movement was encumbered by a massive canister held under one arm and a much smaller bucket held in the other. The human reached the central safety light that provided for the main path and set down the two items.

“What is it doing outside?” Flume demanded. “There can’t be any scheduled maintenance that can’t be put off before the local sunrise!”

Commander Millrace turned to his counsel and pulled up the schedule for the day.

“Recreation,” he stated before coming back to crouch beside Flume.

“That is one of our hydrothermal tanks!” Flume suddenly observed. “It’s fully activated and at full capacity!”

Commander Millrace squinted and gave a respectful click. There was no way he could have read the indicator lights at this distance. The airlock opened again and a clawcluster of humans came stumbling out with their bizarre two-legged gate. Commander Millrace wasn’t an expert at reading the mammals’ tail flicks but from the way they bumped into each other they seemed excited. They reached the human with the hydrothermal canister and separated into an observation semi-circle that seemed centered neither on the first human nor the canisters but the safety light. The first human pulled something out of the pocket of his thermal armor and waved it around in the air.

“What does he have? Commander Millrace asked.

“I can’t quite tell,” Flume admitted. “Some small human device?”

Suddenly there was a ping from the counsel and Commander Millrace glanced back at it curiously. Outside the human with the device was gesturing and the other humans were rotating their semi-circle in response.

“Who is starting a private video broadcast this early in the work cycle?” Flume asked.

“Those humans,” Commander Millrace answered as his pupils narrowed in surprise.

“The video is labeled pretty lights,” Flume observed.

Commander Millrace pulled up the video on his data pad and they listened to the human, he thought it was the first one, chattering in it’s own language. The automatic translator was spitting out what seemed to be a list of safety permutations having to do with human skin tolerances for high temperature water. Commander Millrace felt his scales tense with sudden undefined unease.

“The video is on a slight delay,” Flume stated. “They are actually filling the bucket with boiling water, what-?”

His question was cut off with a gurgle of panicked shock as the human flung the bucket of boiling water into the air over the other humans’ heads. However the water turned instantly to a glittering crystal fog that caught the pale beam of the safety light and shattered it into rainbows. There was the faint sound of cheering from the grouped humans as the low wind whisked the fog away from them, down the open end of their semi-circle. A few moments later the cheers were echoed in the video.

Commander Millrace and Flume stared out at them in shocked contemplation for several moments. Finally Flume shifted uneasily.

“I reframe my question,” he said in subdued tones. “Is it a morally responsible decision to leave those unstable mammals unsupervised on such a dangerous world?”

Help identifying a post-apocalyptic sci-fi story ,"Hey, I need some help identifying a story I can’t get out of my head.

The main characters were inside a building when the attack happened, and afterward, they try to escape. The city, I think it was some American city, they’re in is quite modern, with holograms as workers like in a museum or in a tram, controlled by an AI.

At one point, the characters are tasked with turning the power back on, and a hologram tells them they need to go outside the city to activate or repair something. It’s also possible that the story is by a German author.

Space craft equivalent of a motorhome,"Hi. I don't know where to ask this. But I'm very curious.  
I've seen space craft in sci-fi that is equivalent of a fighter plane/vehicle, a big sea cruiser, a transport truck. However I've never seen anything equivalent to an motorhome.  
Say you need to make a  very long space road trip alone or with family, but you don't need a whole colony following you and self sustained farming space, but you need something bigger than a fighter to carry supplies and accommodations like bathroom, kitchen, bed to last for a few days. Or maybe the vehicle can be you mobile home, and you rely on space stations to top up supplies. A transport craft is the closest thing, but you want space for accommodation rather than cargo.  
Is there a word for that kind of space craft? And are there any examples in pop culture?",scifi

Help me understand sci-fi short films?,"TL;DR  --  Short sci-films usually leave me confused. Is that intentional? Are they often meant just to mess with your mind and leave you wondering what just happened? I've watched online lectures about sci-fi as a whole, yet I don't understand the kind of films featured on the DUST YouTube channel. What am I missing? 

--

Looking for some insight from fellow fans -- I love to read sci-fi short story collections. Asimov's ""Robot Visions"" and ""War with the Robots"" are favorites of mine. There's an art to making a short story worth reading; it needs to grab your attention, create characters and conflict that you care about, usually make some kind of observation about technology or the human condition or raise a difficult question, then get out and leave the reader thinking about what they just experienced. In some ways, I think it's harder to write a good short story than it is to write a full-length novel. The constraints are harder. 

Then as a movie buff, I could watch thoughtful sci-fi films all day. Even if they're low-budget or have really bad CGI, I'll give it a shot. So lately I've been watching short films on YouTube, especially on the DUST channel, and I'm usually left wondering at the end of each story, *""What the hell was that about??""* They often seem overblown and melodramatic, with some bad acting, but I try to look past all that and ask what the film was really about. What point were they trying to make? What were they trying to say? How did that mess win so many awards? I end up feeling like it was a waste of time, but I figure I missed something and that bothers me. It wasn't necessarily entertaining and I don't see their point. Is it just me? What am I missing? I usually find hidden meanings and subtext in everything I watch, but these movies just leave me shaking my head. I may not be the sharpest pencil in the box but I don't think I'm the dullest either. Help?",scifi

Favorite/Most Unique forms of FTL Travel?,"I’ve been trying to make a list on various forms of FTL in fiction. So far, I have:
* Spatial compression/expansion
* Going to higher dimensions
* Dipping into a parallel dimension that either has no concept of distance, a vastly compressed distance, or with locations jumbled up
* Wormhole/Portal generators, either static or ship-mounted
* Tapping into a special energy/material/technique of some kind which deny’s the light speed barrier

I got these from: Star Trek [Warp Drive], Star Wars [Hyperdrive], Cytonic [The Nowhere], The Cosmere [The Cognitive Realm], Warhammer 40k [The Warp], Star Gate [Star Gates], Portal [The Portal Gun], DC [The Speed Force], Futurama [Dark Matter], A Wrinkle In Time [Tessering]

**Edit:** Cooked up some extra FTL categories from the responses so far, as well as some things I remembered:
* Spatial folding (different from spatial compression/expansion in that, instead of making the space the ship moves shorter, it connects the space that the ship is in to the space they want to go to. Difference between stretching a rubber band and folding a piece of paper)
* Probability/reality manipulation, moving from one place to another for literally no reason other than the fact that it’s now probable for it to happen
* Parallel universe swap, travel to an identical copy of your reality in the location you want to go to. The other you traveled to the location as well, just in your own original reality
* Gravity drive. I like to call this the Singularity Sled. The most common form works by generating a black hole at the front of the ship, pulling them forwards, but that also moves the black hole forwards, ad infinitum as its gravity drags it along. Other versions use artificial gravity instead
* Coordinate change, where through some means the ships coordinates are changed, as though through commands. Most likely reasons are that the ship is out of sync with normal reality, or it somehow ‘hacks’ into the universe
* Mass dampeners / Inertia preventers, messing with Newtons Laws to prevent deceleration and make acceleration easier
* Time manipulation, artificially altering the ships flow of time relative to the outside universe, making it appear to move faster than possible
* Size manipulation, growing towards your destination while shrinking the side that’s facing away, dragging it forward without actually moving
* Implosive/Explosive keyhole singularity, the ship implosively disappears, sucked into a keyhole singularity, to explosively reappear elsewhere
* Spatial swapping, swapping the contents of one space with another. Not to be confused with spatial folding, this actually exchanges the content of each space in full, not bringing disparate locations together",scifi

Worlds that have greater than average environmental hazards but people still live there. ,"So with all the recent hurricane news I've been thinking about Florida. A lot of the land in Florida is under a consistent barrage of devastating weather for half the year. People still live there despite the semi regular evacuation notices and property damage, not to mention in some cases loss of life. It almost feels like this is a region that nature is telling people, ""Don't live here. It's not safe for you"" folks do live here though for various reasons: the allure of the coastal areas, financial reasons, lack of choice. 

Parts of Alaska would be a similar example. Like Utquiagvik (Barrow) which experiences polar night as well as isolation during the coldest months. 

Taking this concept into a scifi context and even pushing it into its most extreme implications, what are some examples of worlds in existing fiction or even ideas you could come up with that deal with issues like this. Whether it be for natives or colonists. 

For example maybe a tidally locked planet where the people have to live in large mobile cities that travel along with its rotation so they remain in the relatively temperate twilight region, but they also experience the risk of extreme storms from the dramatic temperature differentials. 

Maybe a very ocean heavy moon that experiences extreme tides due to the gravity of its parent planet or other moons orbiting in the same gravity well.

What are some other hazardous environments in which a scifi society could be forced to live? ",scifi
"""I'll be a pie-eyed emu!"" Re-reading Alfred Bester's 1942 story, ""The Push of a Finger""","[""The Push of a Finger][1] (free Gutenberg download) by Alfred Bester, was my second go at reading a story that I loved when I was 12 years old. I re-read it this past weekend, and very much enjoyed it. (Previously: [Revisiting a childhood favorite story: 'Dreams are Sacred' still delights][2].)

[1]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm
[2]: https://mitchw.blog/2024/10/01/i-had-a.html

As with ""Dreams Are Sacred,"" the Bester story is still entertaining. Like ""Dreams Are Sacred,"" the hero is a street-smart, wisecracking New York newspaperman with a brain in his head and abundant common sense. Published in 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction, ""The Push of a Finger"" is set a thousand years in the future, but the situations and language are straight out of a screwball comedy or noir movie from the 40s.

The hero is Carmichael, one of a dozen reporters for as many different newspapers assigned to the mysterious Prog Building in New York, where the technocrats who run the world issue pronouncements to preserve the Stability that has been the rule of civilization for centuries. The reporters are a brawling, fast-talking bunch, but they keep to their roles. By the rule of the Stability, every newspaper must have a balancing newspaper on the other side, and every decision by the ruling technocrats must be met by full-throated agreement by one newspaper and equal denunciation by its opposite number.

Carmichael finds a way to sneak into the mysterious Prog Building and discovers an event that will destroy the universe in a thousand years. ""The Push of a Finger"" has a similar gimmick to the far more famous [""The Sound of Thunder,""][3] by Ray Bradbury, which ran in the far more upscale Collier's magazine in 1952: The cataclysmic change in the future can be prevented by a trivial change in the present. Carmichael leads a team of technocrats in finding out what that minor, precipitating event is and stopping it.

[3]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm

I'm making the story sound more bombastic than it is. Bester was always a playful writer, fond of wordplay, absurdism and doggerel. In ""The Push of a Finger,"" a crowd of students at a demonstration chants

Neon  
Krypton  
Ammoniated  
FitzJohn

and that bit of verse has been stuck in my head for days. (And now it's stuck in yours. Um sorry I guess.)

Later, one of the characters exclaims, ""I'll be a pie-eyed emu!"" which proves to be important.

Bester seemed to be drinking from the same creative well as the Beats (Kerouac, Ginsberg, etc.), but a decade or two earlier, and pinning his writing to a scaffolding of pulp science fiction.

Bester's best-known novels were ""The Demolished Man"" (1953), a murder mystery in a society of telepaths, and ""The Stars My Destination"" (1956), a retelling of the Count of Monte Cristo in a society where people have the power to teleport from one location to another by sheer force of mind.

The politics of ""The Push of a Finger"" are typical of science fiction of the day and maybe of the U.S. at that time. The world of the future was going to be highly organized, centrally planned, and run by technocrats, just as the real world was at that time. It was 1942 -- World War II was raging, the Depression was just a few years earlier, and the great nations of the world were highly centralized machines governed by technocrats. Surely that would continue forever. That's the way Isaac Asimov wrote, and even Robert A. Heinlein, later an icon of libertarianism, featured centrally planned societies in his early stories, published at about this time.

I didn't talk abut racism and sexism in ""Dreams are Sacred"" and I don't have much to say about it here. Both stories are typical in that regard for pulp science fiction written and published in the 1940s. Race isn't mentioned, women are nearly in the background, LGBTQ and disabled people don't exist.

Something odd along those lines that I did notice: In the American pulps of the 40s and earlier, characters almost always had Anglo or European names: Carmichael, Pete Parnell, Steve Blakiston, etc. This was the norm back then, and I grew up in the 70s immersed in stories from that period and didn't think twice about it. But re-reading those stories today, the high percentage of Anglo names (and the missing women and nonwhite people and disabled and LGBTQ people) stands out to me as weird. I'm not saying this to condemn the writers of that era; they were living in their world just as I live in ours. But it's odd and unrealistic.

Bester was a giant of science fiction when I was a young fan in the 70s, and all science fiction fans then would have heard of him and most would have read him. Now I suspect he's nearly forgotten by anybody under 50. Sic transit [gloria mundi.][4]

The Internet Con: How To Seize The Means Of Computation, ,scifi
Favorite/Most Unique forms of FTL Travel?,"I’ve been trying to make a list on various forms of FTL in fiction. So far, I have:
* Spatial compression/expansion
* Going to higher dimensions
* Dipping into a parallel dimension that either has no concept of distance, a vastly compressed distance, or with locations jumbled up
* Wormhole/Portal generators, either static or ship-mounted
* Tapping into a special energy/material/technique of some kind which deny’s the light speed barrier

I got these from: Star Trek [Warp Drive], Star Wars [Hyperdrive], Cytonic [The Nowhere], The Cosmere [The Cognitive Realm], Warhammer 40k [The Warp], Star Gate [Star Gates], Portal [The Portal Gun], DC [The Speed Force], Futurama [Dark Matter], A Wrinkle In Time [Tessering]

**Edit 1:** Cooked up some extra FTL categories from the responses so far, as well as some things I remembered:
* Spatial folding (different from spatial compression/expansion in that, instead of making the space the ship moves shorter, it connects the space that the ship is in to the space they want to go to. Difference between stretching a rubber band and folding a piece of paper)
* Probability/reality manipulation, moving from one place to another for literally no reason other than the fact that it’s now probable for it to happen
* Parallel universe swap, travel to an identical copy of your reality in the location you want to go to. The other you traveled to the location as well, just in your own original reality
* Gravity drive. I like to call this the Singularity Sled. The most common form works by generating a black hole at the front of the ship, pulling them forwards, but that also moves the black hole forwards, ad infinitum as its gravity drags it along. Other versions use artificial gravity instead
* Coordinate change, where through some means the ships coordinates are changed, as though through commands. Most likely reasons are that the ship is out of sync with normal reality, or it somehow ‘hacks’ into the universe
* Mass dampeners / Inertia preventers, messing with Newtons Laws to prevent deceleration and make acceleration easier
* Time manipulation, artificially altering the ships flow of time relative to the outside universe, making it appear to move faster than possible
* Size manipulation, growing towards your destination while shrinking the side that’s facing away, dragging it forward without actually moving
* Implosive/Explosive keyhole singularity, the ship implosively disappears, sucked into a keyhole singularity, to explosively reappear elsewhere
* Spatial swapping, swapping the contents of one space with another. Not to be confused with spatial folding, this actually exchanges the content of each space in full, not bringing disparate locations together

**Edit 2:** Here’s some more:
* Going to lower dimensions, ie 2D or 1D space
* Enlightenment/Unenlightenment, becoming one with everything then giving it up to drop your body anywhere
* Moving the universe around yourself, causing the illusions of movement without actually physically moving
* Making the universe ignore you, allowing you to break its laws for as long as it does
* Deconstructing/reconstructing yourself, the suicide booth option since the you that appears at the destination isn’t the same as the you that wanted to go there",scifi

Will AI Unlock Humanity's Greatest Secrets?,"We’ve all heard about AI being used for practical things—predicting the weather, diagnosing diseases, improving tech—but what if AI could do something much bigger? What if it could answer questions we've wrestled with since the dawn of time? Questions like: Are we alone? Is there a divine being? What happens after we die?





One part of the video that really stuck with me was the idea that AI might someday be able to reinterpret religious texts—across all faiths—and find connections or truths that we've completely missed. Can you imagine what would happen if AI pointed out contradictions in these texts, or found proof that some events or figures weren't what we thought they were? The ripple effects on global religion would be huge. Would people hold tighter to their faith, or would we see mass conversions to new beliefs based on AI's findings?

Even more fascinating (and a little eerie) was the suggestion that AI could uncover evidence of ancient extraterrestrial influence on human civilization. The video doesn’t just toy with this idea; it lays out the possibility that religions and myths could have been shaped by beings from other worlds. If that’s true, how would we even begin to reconcile that with everything we’ve been taught? Could AI end up guiding us into a new era of understanding where the lines between gods and aliens blur?

And then there’s the wildest part—what if AI could actually contact these advanced civilizations? It raises some intense questions about what our role is in the universe. Are we just a small part of a much larger cosmic story? And what would it mean if we found out we’ve been under the influence or guidance of something—or someone—not of this Earth all along?

Honestly, after watching this, I can't stop thinking about the possibilities. The video touches on so many deep philosophical and existential questions that I’ve never really considered, or at least not in this way. It made me wonder: If AI can offer us these kinds of insights, are we ready for what it might uncover? What does the truth even look like, and how much of it do we really want to know?

I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. How do you think people would react if AI started proving or disproving aspects of our history, faith, or even our origin story? Would society crumble under the weight of the truth, or would it lead to a whole new age of enlightenment?

If you haven’t watched the video yet, I highly recommend it. And once you do, let’s talk. I feel like there’s so much to unpack, and I need to know what others think.",scifi

Pandorum,"Pandorum is an adaptation of The Time Machine. Prove me wrong.

If not the novel, then at least the movie. I'm not sure how closely the movie followed the novel. Maybe I should read it.

Edit: I should probably provide some reasoning behind my statement lol.

The Morlock-Mutant parallel is obvious. Regressive evolution of mankind, devoid of humanity.

From there, we have:

(Martdegen)Main protagonist Bower: ""time-travels"" via hypersleep, dropped into an unforgiving, new world in the future. Spends much of the movie trying to save his wife, only to realize she is gone forever. Destroys the ship(Time Machine) in order to overcome evil and alter the future of humanity, saving everyone from being nothing more than cattle.

(Mara)Supporting protagonist Nadia: savvy, sheperd of life archetype. Saves our time-traveler and guides him in the new world. Implied at the end to become his new wife/partner.

(Morlock overlord)Main antagonist Payton: ""Creator/Leader"" of animalistic spawn of humanity's evil incarnate. Power hungry, nihilistic, maniac who views people as means to an end/food.

(Vox)The Cannibal: survivor tormented by circumstance and history. Provides context of what came to be to our protagonists.

(Mankind) Brings about its own downfall, reach exceeds our grasp.

(Time Machine) Vessel, plot driver. Must be destroyed in the end, as a means to correct humanity's path.

Also, Martdegen's friend. Symbolic of the basic instinct to fit in socially, as a survival mechanism. Shown by his adherence to ""bowler hat"" norms, and his general demeanor. Parallels the Morlock caste system, and at the end he tosses the hat, signifying hope for the future. This is echoed in Pandorum, by the crew that ultimately chose basic survival rather than overthrow Payton during his initial coup, and rise to power that set everything in motion.

I may have missed a couple points, but that's the gist of it as far as I'm concerned. I haven't watched Pandorum in a long time. I watched The Time Machine last night for the first time in at least ten years, and it dawned on me.",scifi

Space craft equivalent of a motorhome,"Hi. I don't know where to ask this. But I'm very curious.  
I've seen space craft in sci-fi that is equivalent of a fighter plane/vehicle, a big sea cruiser, a transport truck. However I've never seen anything equivalent to an motorhome.  
Say you need to make a  very long space road trip alone or with family, but you don't need a whole colony following you and self sustained farming space, but you need something bigger than a fighter to carry supplies and accommodations like bathroom, kitchen, bed to last for a few days. Or maybe the vehicle can be you mobile home, and you rely on space stations to top up supplies. A transport craft is the closest thing, but you want space for accommodation rather than cargo.  
Is there a word for that kind of space craft? And are there any examples in pop culture?  
Edit: Thanks for the replies. I had little access to popular Western sci-fi during my childhood, so the only space sci-fi I know is Star Wars original trilogy, and only a small amount of it. That's why I'm asking this to expand my knowledge now that I have relatively free internet access. No bait or any ill purpose.   
I have this idea because of the rising amount of single people living on motorhome in China, due to the rising housing cost. ",scifi

My favorite shows are Dark and Battlestar Galactica and I grew up on Star Trek TNG. Any other recs that fit my description would be appreciated as well. Cheers!

EDIT: Thanks for so much for all of your suggestions. I'm excited that so many people love all three! I binged 4 episodes of Legion with my husband last night, and surprisingly, neither of us knew anything about it, who produced it, etc. When you don't know who or what it's about, the first episode is incredibly satisfying. They pull off A LOT in that first episode. My background is in clinical psychology so I ate it up.

Book Review: Dark Space by Rob Hart and Alex Segura,"TL;DR Review: A classic spy thriller…in space! Fast-paced, gripping, and intriguing.

**Full Review:**

*Dark Space* is the perfect book for fans of John Le Carre, a slow-burn yet quick-moving thriller that had me blazing through page after page to find out what the heck is going on.

From the beginning, it’s clear that things are NOT all right:

* Aboard the *Mosaic,* a colonizing ship hurtling through space toward a planet that is to be humanity’s hope of the future, pilot **Jose Carriles** suspects something is very much wrong when not one, not two, but *three* separate ship systems fail all at the same time. Worse, no one—not the captain nor the head engineer—seems interested in finding out.
* Back on New Destiny, humanity’s moon colony, **Corin Timony** receives a cryptic message from the *Mosaic,* only to have it immediately canceled. To top it off, she’d ordered to go home and forget about what she saw, only for a mysterious senator to push her to look into matters *and* for the only other person to see the *Mosaic’s* message to wind up dead.

Though light years and galaxies separate the two stories, it’s clear from the beginning that they are very much linked. Figuring out *how* is where the fun comes in.

The stakes are set from the very beginning, and the tension just gets ratcheted up with every new obstacle, enemy, discovery, and mystery. The pacing of each chapter is zippy enough to keep you wanting to read on—I said “just one more chapter” about a dozen times—and the hooks are baited so well that you’re drawn deeper and deeper.

I legitimately had knots in my shoulder as the story drew closer to revealing what the heck was going on, and even then, that’s just the beginning of MORE mystery, more suspense, more danger, and more challenges for the characters to overcome.

The action scenes were fun but short—this isn’t a Ludlum or Clancy thriller, but the sort that involves investigation over ass-kicking, problem-solving and people-handling over spaceship chases and gunfights.

But make no mistake: the book gives you all the excitement, intrigue, suspense, and exhilaration you could ask for. Atop that, the character work done into both Timony and Carriles was excellent, exploring their past screw-ups, present quagmires, and bleak futures in enough detail to make them easily relatable and grounded characters.

There’s even a bit of *Star Trek*-esque commentary on humanity woven nicely into the story. Through this adventure, we come face to face with both our flaws and fortes as a society. But by the ending, we’re shown a brighter way forward and left with a sense of hope that offers wonderful closure.

I enjoyed the hell out of this book—I read it in *one* day—and absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic spy thriller…but set in space!",scifi

Are there any other trans folks here who want to discuss the problematic nature of the episode?

And anyone want to discuss the ethical implications of continuing to watch it?

I felt like Guy Mann is just the coded projection of a chaser excusing their behavior, for one.

How based does that observation seem?

I'm kind of just sick about all of it. I grew up on The X-Files. I'm pretty damn disgusted with the portrayal of the trans woman in the episode, and with the misinfo and digs about GAC as well.

I'm reading the second book in the Encounter with Rama series. (Arthur C Clarke),"SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!

I fell in love with the first book, but the second one isn't doing it for me. From yesterday to today I read 200 pages, and I hate that reporter. Francesca, her name. And some male characters are so... Childish...

Francesca seems like an annoying sociopath, She is arrogant, inconvenient and overbearing, an eternal popular and mean teenager from North American movies.

Much of the book so far has been a dull, endless drama.  I fell in love with the alien ship, the mystery, and the speculation of their civilization's capabilities. We also don't know where they're from, whether they're alive or dead... I've come to think that the ships are relics, that they've finally abandoned generational travel and discovered more advanced ways of visiting the stars.

This is my opinion, do you recommend that I continue reading? I've read a lot of people saying that they hated the other books.

JAA'ABANI:2120 is  an adult cyberpunk sci-fi novel set 100 years in the future. 

Texas has seceded the union and become a mecca for white supremacists. After a century of war, environmental strife, and 'the 2nd dark age,' the New Reich is the leading world power via control of the insidious Animus Civitas technology--a simulation that mesmerizes the mind while drawing energy from your physical nervous system. Millions languish in 'the Siv' while their families watch their bodies wither in the Real, caught hopelessly in indentured-streaming contracts to the richest influencers of the New Reich. A new hero, the last Heir-Architect, finally joins the Siv and begins a war to defend all people stuck in mental slavery. Mayhem and monstrosity takes hold of the simulation when a serial-killer begins recreating crimes from the past, their victims inexplicably dying in the Real--their corpses set in a twisted grin that is the killer's grisly calling card.​

Sci fi books that read like character focused fantasy for a beginner looking to get into the genre? ,"
I am interested in reading Sci fi, specially space opera, but from what I have gathered from friends that do read scifi is that it's (Very generally) a genre focused on cool, deep, interesting or innovative ideas and themes, and characters take a secondary role. Of course, I haven't read any Sci fi books and I don't know all of them, so I want recommendations. 

I am interested in a good story with great characters, it can involve war, politics, exploration etc, maybe akin to halo or mass effect.  I would prefer if the books were either modern or not too difficult to get into. I know nothing of Scifi so please recommend me anything, even if it seems the most obvious answer. 

I would also prefer if they were more mature books and not YA, which isn't my cup of tea. The only books I know of are Dune and Gideon the Ninth (Which I haven't read but got them on my list). ",scifi

Rendezvous with Rama film adaptation - soundtrack idea,"Now that Denis Villeneuve is going to direct the cinematographic adaptation of Rendezvous with Rama, I wanted to share something that happened to me while reading the book that I think would be amazing to have in the film. 

I read most of the book during my commute to/from work, and for the most part while also listening to music on my headphones. By mere chance, while I was reading the part where the astronauts enter Rama for the first time, the song that was playing was Welcome to the Machine by Pink Floyd. And...

Welcome my son,
Welcome to the machine.

It's alright we know where you've been

Wolfman vs. Godzilla,"In the early 80s, former Toho staff who worked on previous Godzilla films got together to work on this ""fan film."" Unfortunately Toho got angry ag them and the project got lost. However in the mid to late 2010s, a decent amount of footage was brought over on YouTube. I still wish a completed version was released on DVD.",scifi

Alternate History?,Does alternate history count as sci-fi?  I am trying to recall title of a book that had a timeline ~1914 where an independent Confederate States of America was allied with Great Britain.  They competed in a naval race with the USA building enormous battleships armed with 30” and 36” guns?  Does that sound familiar?,scifi

Ancient internet ,"Let’s say a million years from now after the tech has been forgotten if they “discovered” the internet or recreated it would all the information still be there? And if so could there have been like an ancient internet? I’ve heard of the Akashic records so maybe that was just an ancient form of data storage and transfer similar to our internet? Would we be able to search for some kind of lost data storage?

Edit: okay so a million years is not feasible, let’s say 100000. And our modern computers use binary code and cheap forms of memory. If in ancient times they had  a device that translated data off of similar forms then it too would not exist anymore. So let’s say they used crystal skullls as the storage device and powered it using an unknown source (natural nuclear reactors have existed on earth) and didn’t use magnetism. If there was such a device and was left powered (kinda getting into stargate territory here) then there might be a possibility of accessing it? I get that our internet is pretty limited and would not survive without human interaction the entire time, that seems a little cocky of humanity and I feel that even the ancient world would have understood the volatility of our current internet and would have created something more permanent. Even we are currently trying to archive the internet. ",scifi
Terminator Zero - Worth continuing after episode 3?,"So I was loving this series until episode 3. I thought it was a really great spin on the Terminator story and I was digging all the characters and story beats. Then I watched episode 3 and it completely tanked the series, thus far, for me. 

The Terminator is so weak and stupid, and Eiko's plot armour is so ridiculously thick that it has destroyed all tension and stakes for me. 

My issues are as follows:
- Reika was trapped in an enclosed space with the Terminator. There was no way she should have been able to escape. The fact that she did makes the Terminator look stupid.
- The Terminator severely injured Eikod. It would have been the work of a moment to finish her off and neutralise a threat. 
- The Terminator smashed Eikod in the back, multiple times. Eikod should be dead, her bones smashed into pulp.
- After failing to smash Eikod's back to pieces, Eikod then overpowers a FREAKING TERMINATOR and pushes it down the elevator shaft!

I've heard people defend this stuff as, well it's just anime logic. However, I don't recall a Titan ever smashing Levi in the back and then Levi just casually overpowering the Titan to push it off a mountain or something in Attack in Titan. Levi getting smashed in the back by a Titan and then just casually overpowering it to push it off a mountain, without any equipment, is the equivalent of what has happened in this show in episode 3.

Sure, Eikod fighting a Terminator on the end of a rope in episode 1 was a bit silly. Also Eikod running up a falling truck to safety in episode 2 is a bit silly. Hell, Eikod kicking and punching the Terminator in episode 3 is very silly, she would break her hands and feet. Still, I could just about apply anime logic to that stuff and suspend my disbelief that far. But the Terminator smashing Eikod in the back multiple times and then Eikod not only walking away, but actually overpowering the Terminator is just too much.

Yeah, Reika, Eikod and everyone else were always going to beat the Terminator but it needed to happened within the rules if the universe. Once those rules are broken, there a no stakes or tension. Episode 3 shattered those rules with a Terminator punch to the back. There doesn't feel like there is any tension because there is nothing the Terminator can do to win, he is too weak and stupid. In contrast, Eikod is far to overpowered to lose. Real shame, because I was really enjoying it up until episode 3.

So genuine question to people who have watched the rest of the series. Is it worth watching episode 4 and beyond, or should I just quit now? (No spoilers or as light as possible, for episode 4 and beyond please.)

Edit: So, I did watch the rest of Terminator Zero. I am glad that I did, as I think the story was fantastic. The Terminator is still quite weak and stupid but never as egregiously so, as in episode 3, again. Ironically, the best bits of this Terminator series was when the Terminator wasn't actually in it. The story moments, character arcs and time travel shenanigans are actually kind of fun. The series certainly gets you thinking about alternate timelines! Unfortunately, the Terminator never really becomes a credible threat, apart from MAYBE at the very end, (by which point the damage is already done to his character), which is a shame. Weak and stupid Terminator aside, I'd say this was actually a pretty good series.",scifi

could we build a spaceship from iron pyrite,"I was watching some videos about the Baltic Sea anomaly which is basically a stone feature at the bottom of the Baltic sea that resembles the millennium falcon but made out of stone. I went on a rabbit hole about whether we could build a spaceship out of stone, which could be possible with use of an asteroid but the type of stone used would have to be something non porous and even if you could find an asteroid of granite and hollow it out and shape the outside to look however you want it to, it would be ridiculously heavy and unrealistic to be able to have engines that could move it. So I though can refined metal petrify into a stone like wood? And yes it can. So what if we used iron pyrite to make a spaceship? And or could an old burried spaceship turn back into a natural rock to the point we’d never even be able to recognize it as it was?",scifi
Spaceship Names In Non-English Sci-Fi?,"Hey folks,

I'm running a sci-fi ttrpg, and so, just as a fun exercise, I started making a list of spaceship names that I can dip into in the future. It's going well, and I've got some great ones, but I started realizing that they're all in English. The people in my setting don't speak English, at least not exclusively, so I thought it would be a good idea to get some ship names from other languages interspersed in there.

But then I realized, I haven't seen many examples of that! The only one that comes to mind is the \*Y Que\* from the Expanse - absolutely rad ship name, by the way. So, I thought I'd ask all of you.

Specifically this question is geared toward sci-fi fans whose first language is not English, and who read a lot of non-English sci-fi (although if that doesn't fully apply to you, feel free to chime in). What are spaceship naming conventions in your linguistic corner of sci-fi? What are some of your favorite ship names?

Edit: to be clear, I'm not looking for real spacecraft names, or how it's done in English; I'm asking how sci-fi authors, who write in languages other than English, name spaceships. If you're a sci-fi fan whose primary language is not English, you're who I'm mostly looking for.",scifi

Please recommend sci-fi series similar to Firefly,"Hey there!

I just finished watching the *Firefly* series for the first time, and I absolutely loved it! I'm on the lookout for more lighthearted and fun sci-fi series to dive into.

Here are some of my favorites:

* *The Fifth Element* (my all-time favorite movie)
* *The X-Files*
* *Cleopatra 2525*
* *Sliders*

*I also think The Expanse* is an incredible series, but it leans a bit too serious for my taste.

I'd really appreciate any recommendations you have!

Could you help me find a sci-fi horror short story I read once when I was a child?,"This happened in Catalonia at some point between 2008-2011.

In my school we had a library, and every class had a shelf with some books from said library. The books where changed every so often. A few days per year the teachers would have us pick a book and read it for the entirety of the hour.

The only book I remember reading from this was a sci-fi horror antology book. I picked because it specifically had a space theme going on in the cover and/or title, and I thought that was interesting. All the stories on it were somewhat sci-fi, and I think all of them were horror, but I'm not 100% sure on this last part.

I think it had like 3 stories only (again, not 100% sure). It was a short book, I think it was aimed for children. Definitely nothing gore. One story had a futuristic restaurant as the setting, I think?

Either way, I'm really interested in only one story in particular, the only one I really remember. It was about a space crew who went to the Moon (I'm fairly sure it was the Moon). They might've been a permanent expedition there, I don't know. Either way, everyone on the crew goes back to Earth for some reason except the protagonist, who stays on the moon to keep maintenance in the lunar base or something like that. And in the absolute loneliness of the Moon, he starts noticing strange things. Shadows moving in the corners of his eyes, things aren't where he remembers leaving them. The story goes on about the tasks he's got to do on the Moon and his day to day life, but the strangeness keeps increasing in scale and frequency, and at some point in the story, it's very clear there's *something* out there. But the protagonist doesn't know what. He looks all around the shuttle and the base, he doesn't find anything nor anyone. He never manages to see the thing, he only catches glimpses of a shadow. The story ends with the protagonist going back to Earth and, on the rocket, he looks down to the Moon through the windows one last time. And he, once again, catches a shadow in the corner of his eye, only for it to be gone once he realizes it.

We the reader never get to see the thing or to even know *if* there really was a thing or not. It's a great concept, isn't it? It has stayed on my mind for all these years because of that. I'd like to reread it again, but I don't know the name of the story or its author.

Because this was in Catalonia this means the story could have been from a Catalan author and originally written in Catalan (I did read it in Catalan), or a story originally written in Spanish by a Spanish or Latinoamerican author, or a story from anywhere in the world translated into Catalan. I don't have a clue. I think it's probable the stories were American short sci-fi stories from the 60s or 70s which were translated and compiled into an anthology book, and that's what I'm hoping for, because if it was a local production I don't think I'll be able to find it.

Does anyone recognize this story?",scifi

Recently watched Prospect. It's probably my favourite sci-fi film - is there anything else out there like it?,"What I loved about it and what I want more of:

-The space western vibe
-The practical effects with that retro/ analogue look and minimal flashy CGI. They really made me feel like the world was lived in.
-The below the surface world building that left me with a sense that the universe had a huge amount depth that let my imagination run rampant.
-Great, believable characters 
-Interesting slow burn story about interesting characters acting like humans. No flashy marvelesque bloated action scenes. 
-The amount of love that obviously went into making it
-The tiny budget and how amazing and real it all looked. 

More films on a similar vein would be great. Books too, even comics (although I'm not a comic guy) cheers!",scifi

Modern Sci fi fandom needs to stop thinking it is political,"Now I am well aware that sci fi fandom is not a monolith. There are different levels. You get people who just like sci fi and that's that, then you get people who join clubs to meet up with other fans, write fanfics, collect figures, books, comics etc all of which are obviously fine and form the backbone of the genres fandom.

However sadly these types of fans are almost always overlooked in the media and by the industry for career fans, people who ironically might not even be that big fans in real life, but who see a potential career in the genre. They shill for big companies, run toxic websites like Den of Geek, The Mary Sue, run official magazines, become little commandants of official forums, or boast about how nerdy they are on their podcasts like Chris Hardwick did before his fall from grace, host after show podcasts where they schmooze with the actors and writers etc.

Sadly in many circles, the career fans who see themselves as the elite are often able to shape the narrative and whip people up into cliques and groups because their opinions are given the widest reach in the media. This has been a problem since I'd say at least the 1980s. Colin Baker, a former Doctor Who even mentions that shows fandom getting in his own words ""far too top heavy"" in the 80s.

Within the last ten years however this problem has become worse than ever thanks to the introduction of identity politics, which has allowed the elitist, career fans to bully those they don't like by smearing them as racists, incels etc. This kind of behavior has in turn led to another huge clique forming in response, the anti identity politics, anti woke, anti SJW mob, who have sadly developed their own elite who just want to take over from the current clique but would be no better.

Most hilariously of all however the majority of people in both cliques ESPECIALLY the leading media figures as it were aren't actually political. The politics part was just a tool used by the opportunists on both sides to whip people up and was a very shallow form of identity politics that has no bearing on either real left or right wing politics. (For the record I would identify as an old school lefty, NOT a centrist. However you don't have to be a centrist to see what's going on here.)

Identity and neoliberal politics are shallow, bastardisations of left wing politics, that are pushed by upper middle class poseurs who want to look cool and lefty, but are too stupid, shallow or scared to fight for genuine left wing causes. Or alternatively they can be pushed by elitists to cover their own twisted, bigoted actions. ""How can Tony Blair be a right wing traitor. Sure he backed the most right wing President of all time in invading another country for its oil, and his government undermined the NHS and Thatcher said New Labour was her greatest legacy, but he has x amount of women in his cabinet via the Blair babes so he must be progressive."" Same with Barack ""drone king"" Obama who destroyed Libya but was seen as progressive simply for being the first black man to become President.

People USED to make a distinction between these types and actual lefties. Frank Zappa was a lefty who wrote vicious attacks against American Imperialism, but was equally scathing of the phony Hippies who embodied this type of shallow politics in the 60s. The Who's Don't Get Fooled Again perfectly sums these people up, and Rick a character from The Young Ones a classic British comedy took the piss out of these kinds of lefties (with Rik Mayall who played him being a lefty himself.) However somewhere in the 90s-00s people started to see the left as actually being like this, which sadly allowed the neo liberal, identity politics crowd to rope more people in.

Incredibly enough a kind of right wing identity politics soon formed in response, focusing on white male identity, and valuing women and black people who sided with the conservatives like Candace Owens etc. Like I said it's these types of politics that were used by the main media figures in both cliques that are currently destroying the sci fi fandom and genres.

Most normal people in the fandom have been sucked in because maybe they have a few things they genuinely care about, and whichever side is genuinely talking about them will seem like their people and before they know it they are part of that tribe and have to go along with everything it says and often will without knowing it.  Or maybe didn't want to get involved in either side, but the result is the same.

Very few people in general are actually political. I'm not saying I am a political scientist or anything LOL or that those who are not political are stupid. Very few of us, me included have time for politics, as we have real world problems, working 9-5 jobs, looking after kids or sick loved ones, and the free time we do have, we devote to our actual hobbies.

It's a shame as we all, myself included could do with knowing more, but still politics is a complicated subject that really needs a lot of your time to understand. Same is true of any subject, including sci fi.

Things like more female heroes, or even are politics taking over sci fi stories too much are valid talking points for sci fi fans meanwhile that don't require huge political knowledge, and genre fans should realise that they can talk about them without this kind of identity politics left/right tribalism sneaking in.

In order for that to happen rather than call one side MARXISTS or another side FAR RIGHTERS which empowers them as it does make them look political. We need to instead tell both sides if they try and bring that shit in.

***""You know fuck all about politics. You really aren't fit to talk about this incredibly complex subject. Either you're a snake oil salesman/woman wanting to rile us up, or you've been misled by one. Want to talk about the actual genre we're supposed to be talking about, go ahead. Otherwise no. You're neither left nor right. You don't have enough knowledge of either actual conservative or left wing politics to form an opinion on either so stop bringing your bastardisation of both into these franchises.""***

Of course I'm sure some sci fi fans will be genuinely political LOL, but most of the time and again certainly the ""dominant voices in the media"" and even on forums? No. They don't have a political bone in their bodies, and their analysis and opinions about things from a political perspective are always at best mind meltingly shallow, at worst toxic and hypocritical. Don't believe me? Look at this.

The so called ""lefty"" side of fandom regularly ruins people, yet protects far worse scum in the industry if they happen to voice the same shallow opinions IE belong to their tribe. Until recently Neil Gaiman was a shining example of this. Others include Neil Patrick Harris, who created a cake to resemble Amy Winehouse's rotting corpse a few weeks after she died and showed it online, but has received NO backlash as he's in with the bricks.

The treatment of Gina Carano on the other hand for not being completely a part of this tribe in contrast is nothing short of disgraceful. (okay I know this is a bit of an obsession of mine and I won't spend too long here so as to not derail the thread, but it is a perfect example.)

She was fired for mild opinions and smeared as a transphobe and a Nazi for them (Which honestly did remind me of Rik from the Young Ones ""Have you had enough Nazi or do you want some more?"". ""Neil are these lentils South African? YOU BASTARD YOU UTTER BASTARD I SUPPOSE YOU HATE GAY PEOPLE TOO HIPPIE!"")

Meanwhile she has endured horrific sexism in the industry and these so called feminists not only ignore it, they take the side of the perverts she's against just because it is her and she's in their simple view, the other tribe.

On the set of Deadpool its makers tried to force Gina to get her tits out on camera and threatened to fire her if she didn't. They actually DID fire her eventually, and put pressure on her even afterwards, saying it would hurt her career if she didn't get the girls out. Her own agent by the way also took their side and tried to pressure her to get her tits out.

Basically this is what Gina was subject to.

[https://youtu.be/Qx\_CTBI542M](https://youtu.be/Qx_CTBI542M)

Fortunately as she had filmed lots of scenes already they had to eventually rescind their decision and keep her on, but she was cut from the sequel as a result. The lefty side meanwhile gloated over the recent release of Deadpool and Wolverine to Gina on social media saying ""haha this bitch could have been in it and she blew another franchise."" If she were on their side, they'd call her story an inspiring ME TOO moment.

Meanwhile in her case against Disney, the company has hired Daniel M Petrocelli to crush Gina's lawsuit. This is a man who got Harvey Weinstein off with raping women by threatening his victims in secret. He threatened one physically and said he'd slut shame and humiliate another in court and bribed others saying he didn't care if his client was innocent, money talks. THIS is who Disney have hired to crush Gina, with a female Democrat voting judge ruling that Disney most likely fired Gina and smeared her to distract from their own dodgy dealings, hence why it has gone to discovery. Yet these sites like The Mary Sue still root for Disney and the people who have been misled by them do too? They take the side of a rape enabler over a strong woman, fired for speaking her mind and call themselves feminists? I think that alone demonstrates that they have 0 to offer politically.

Also look at the so called lefty reaction to the first Joker film? Calling that an Incel fantasy based solely on the fact that it had a white male as the lead who was disenfranchised. That's it, that's how deep that went. At no point does Arthur ever express hatred for women, or show anger that women don't like him. Ironically the woman he imagines a relationship with he doesn't harm when he finds out it is in his head. Furthermore ALL his victims and tormentors barring his mother who is mentally ill and almost not responsible for her actions are violent, elitist, rich, or toxic, macho in some cases conservative white men.

Joker is actually a proper left wing movie that looks at how privatisation of health care is strangling western society, as Arthur could have been helped but was kicked to the curb, how the elites look down on those at the bottom with Thomas Wayne having an Ayn Randian view of the poor as not working as hard as he did, how mental health problems are stigmatized in the way people mistreat Arthur and calls out bullying culture brilliantly when Murray shows Arthur having a melt down on tv and humiliates him.

The treatment that Arthur gets from Murray actually reminds me of the unkind, misogynistic treatment Amy Winehouse got ironically from the same media that demonised this film. Let's see both Amy and Arthur have mental health problems that cause people to view them as freaks who deserve to be humiliated? Both went on stage and their mental health problems caused it to be a disaster (in the case of Amy's last concert in Belgrade.) In both cases that humiliation wasn't enough and some little shit recorded them breaking down as a result of severe mental health struggles and showed it off to the rest of the world to laugh at them, and in both cases we kept wanting more of them after, just to sneer at them. (The press following Amy in the hopes she'd have a melt down, Arthur being invited on Murray's show.) Also Murray humiliating Arthur and then virtue signalling serves as a good representation of people like Frankie Boyle who used to laugh at and sneer and bully Amy and others, but now when it is convenient have reinvented themselves as woke.

Yet the Mary Sue and all these other stupid sites called it an Incel movie and ironically praised Deadpool, a movie whose makers are frat boy misogynists that make jokes about Gina Carano being fat, try and threaten her career to get a look at her big juicy boobs and speaking of Amy Winehouse, take a look at this joke they wanted to do about her when again it was trendy to bully her in misogynistic ways and because of her mental health.

[https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-amy-winehouse/](https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-amy-winehouse/)

Yeah Deadpool DOES actually represent an extremely misogynistic sub culture, that obnoxious fratboy mentality of only valuing women based on if they are hot ""Of course we'll hire you Gina, but only if you show us your wazzo pair of jugs, let's demote Morena Baccarin's role, a big character from the comics down to a pretty face with not much else to do, oh Amy's such an ugly skank, let's laugh at her misfortune."" Yet again these stupid feminist sites and lefty's had 0 problems with that and salivated over Deadpool, yet smeared Joker that actually called out this behavior as the movie for incels. How can you ever trust them to call out misogyny or even just to let you know which movies are good ones for talking about leftist issues with this in mind?

The other side however are no better. To start with they have their official demons the way the lefty side does with Gina. Women like Brie Larson, that chick who is in the Snow White film etc are hated to an insane degree for what are still mild opinions and absolutely would be blacklisted like Gina if this side had the power and who knows maybe in a few years they will?

For the record yeah I think Brie Larson's comments about white men were thick as pig shit, but I'm not going to follow her around to every project she is a part of, look for dirt on her, or make out her co-stars hate her because of the way one of them looks in a video and make hundreds of vids about how much I despise her for it like the other side does. How many fucking videos can they make saying the same thing with the same thumbnail for the Snow White chick?

I'm so fucking fed up of the way some actors names can't be mentioned on forums for fear of it inciting a stupid political debate on both sides. David Tennant is also falling into the Brie Larson category for the right side too. I suggested him for Cletus Kasady/Carnage on a fan cast and got lots of shit about how he's a woketurd, NOTHING about his acting, or suitability for the actual role I suggested. Similarly when I suggested Gina Carano for Xena on Reddit I ended up in a debate about whether she was a Nazi shit stain on the arse of humanity, rather than........... Xena!

Did you guys know Christopher Lee was an old Tory? That Donald Sutherland was a rabid Marxist? Imagine that. Would you have liked it if both actors careers were sidelined and we never got to see them in great roles like Dracula or Don't Look Now because of a bunch of infantile self righteous twats online who don't actually have any understanding of either ideology?

Furthermore a lot of these anti woke mob guys like Nerdrotic actually think people like Chris Chibnall, J J Abrams, and companies like Disney are Marxist. NONE of them have the first clue about what Marxism is clearly. The very idea that fucking Disney is a left wing company is a joke. Again a genuine right winger wouldn't come to that conclusion. Only a tribal ""Disney are the side I hate"" would.

I remember seeing a video where the Critical Drinker a popular anti sjw youtuber went on about how socialism is only for weak men, men who can't think for themselves, men who like to be dominated etc. To start with, grow the fuck up. He might as well have said ""our side has all the cool people."" Second of all even if you want to play it by that mantra, I hardly think that the Critical Drinker is more of a man than the Red Army who fought the Nazis in horrific conditions. Just saying?

Also that side as it likes to appeal to young men DOES have a nasty misogynistic streak too. There was a video Nerdrotic and his friends relentlessly tormented a woman named Frosk, by having their friend dress up as her and go on about how unfuckable and ugly she was. Again very nuanced, and thoughtful way to own a feminist. Clearly Nerdrotic and his ilk have 0 to offer politically considering he couldn't even take down someone like Frosk who was an idiot without resorting to nasty schoolyard bullying tactics.

Normally of course these two sides warring with each other wouldn't bother me, except for the fact that in both cases, as the loudest voices over just normal, everyday sci fi fans, I fear they are actually shaping the genre.

People will ALWAYS say ""oh they are just losers online, nobody cares about what they think."" Sorry but that's bullshit and how they get away with it. Companies think these people DO represent what the general public want, they are getting actors like Gina fired, writers blacklisted, shaping the direction of series and taking over any proper discussion about these things to be about their shallow politics rather than genre stories themselves. Look at Doctor Who for instance? When I was a boy its fandom used to be about what is the best monster, story and so on. Now? It's a pissing contest for everybody's political hang ups.

Also take a look at this recent article about how fans will now be brought in as creative consultants for these kinds of movies.

[https://comicbookmovie.com/sci\_fi/star-wars/major-studios-are-assembling-superfan-focus-groups-in-an-effort-to-combat-online-backlash-a213690](https://comicbookmovie.com/sci_fi/star-wars/major-studios-are-assembling-superfan-focus-groups-in-an-effort-to-combat-online-backlash-a213690)

A bad idea overall, but what's the betting in both cases it will be made up of people from both sides of these cliques further turning it into a pissing contest?

Like I said it's high time rather than being called far righters or Marxists, actual sci fi fans fought back and told these people to get off their high horses and stop acting as though they are political scientists when they haven't the first fucking clue about anything even remotely political at all.

If not the genre will keep collapsing.",scifi

The movie is a chamber play with only 3 characters (or maybe a lot more...?), and it's about the multiverse. I've never seen a complex topic of this kind realized so well - without any CGI.

Recommendation wanted,"I’m about to finish the last book of the Bobiverse, and am looking for the next thing. 
Books/series I couldn’t put down:
- all of William Gibson (except The Difference Engine collab)

- LOTR (not sci-fi, obvs)
- The Expanse series
- most of Neal Stephenson (loved Snow Crash and Anathem, meh on Seveneves, Reamde, Dodge, and Dodo, hard no on Baroque)
- Hyperion series
- Earthseed


I grew up on paperback anthologies of short stories by all of the early 20th century’s greats, so I’ve read most of those.  (Asimov, Clarke, Van Vogt, del Rey, etc.)

Suggestions?
