Revisiting a childhood favorite story: ‘Dreams are Sacred’ still delights,"I had a blast Sunday re-reading one of my favorite stories from when I was 12 years old: ""Dreams are Sacred,"" by a writer named Peter Phillips. It was easy to track down -- a quick Google search on the title (which fortunately I remembered) led me to the Internet Archive and a complete scan of the magazine where it was first published: [Astounding Science Fiction, September, 1948][1]

[1]: https://archive.org/details/AstoundingScienceFictionv42n1

The story holds up -- it's exciting, fast-paced and funny.

The hero is Pete Parnell, a fast-talking wisecracking New York sportswriter who is recruited by his friend Steve Blakiston, a psychiatrist, to help with an experimental technique that could cure the madness of a science fiction and fantasy writer named Marsham Craswell. The writer has fallen into an unconscious fugue state and is trapped in an endless dream scenario from his own stories, which resemble Conan the Barbarian or Barsoom.

Fortunately, Blakiston has invented a machine which allows one person to enter another's dream. Parnell is tapped for the job of curing Blakiston because Parnell is the fastest-thinking and hardest-headed person Blakiston knows.

Supporting characters include a friendly cop with an Irish accent straight out of cartoons, a surly cab driver and a sexy lounge singer.

I found the story every bit as enjoyable as I did when I was 12 years old. Old-fashioned? Sure! That's part of the fun.

[Phillips][2], the author, was no New Yorker -- he was English. He was a newspaperman who wrote about two dozen science fiction stories. He died in 2012, age 92. In addition to ""Dreams are Sacred,"" he also wrote another story I loved when I was a boy, ""Manna,"" about a stack of canned super-food that gets transported accidentally back in time to a medieval monastery. Hilarity ensues.

More on Phillips [here][3], including some wonderful old magazine and book covers.

[Astounding Science Fiction,][4] the magazine ""Dreams are Sacred"" appeared in, was founded in 1930, with the delicious title, ""Astounding Stories of Super-Science."" Beginning in 1939, under editor John Campbell, Astounding published groundbreaking writers including Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. The magazine changed its name to Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction in 1960 and still publishes today, under the name [Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact][5].

Also last weekend, I re-read another favorite from the same period, [""The Push of a Finger,""][6] by Alfred Bester. And I downloaded one more, ""Farewell to the Master,"" by Harry Bates, which was the basis for the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""

[6]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm

I read all three stories when I was a boy, in the fat, two-volume anthology, [""The Astounding-Analog Reader,""][7] which I checked out of the East Northport Public Library about a dozen times, every time I was in the mood to re-read it.

[7]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32317590-the-astounding-analog-reader-book-one

All three stories have newspapermen as heroes. I guess those stories made an impression -- I have made my career in journalism of one form or another for my entire life. (In addition to those stories, I also devoured Superman, Spider-Man, and especially the Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. I wanted to be Lou Grant when I grew up. I still do.)

"Ancillary Justice...and, what happened?!","Hello Dear SciFi Reader Friends,

First off, the first book in the series, Ancillary Justice, was absolutely wonderful. I loved everything about it.

I love being dropped in the middle of the story and swapping chapters with the main character's past. It keeps a reader invested.

The idea of a ship AI with human ancillaries, is a wonderful concept. I like that they toy with you a bit, as to how the whole process works.

A galactic ruler with several thousand bodies, is another wonderful idea (something that has been done before, of course). It juxtaposes against the main character's status as an ancillary, in a lot of fun and nuanced ways. They are both parts of a greater whole and more similar than dissimilar. The galactic ruler has more in common with her ship AIs than she does humans.

I really felt the struggle of Justice of Toren and how they describe being cut off from their ship, their body, their way of living.

It was fun to have a main character who could perfectly read human beings, with an explicit reason for doing so. They aren't simply some deus ex machina unicorn, who can magically read human faces better than anyone in the universe. They spent thousands of years studying and knowing everything about humans and is able to use those skills, to gain an upper hand.

There are so many good things to say about this book. I read it in a few days and immediately went to buy the next two books.

I cruised through them in another handful of days, I think I was waiting for something to happen, waiting for the original vision of the first book to come to fruition. It never happened. Nothing happened, really.

I felt like I read a hard sci-fi novel and then I was given two sequels that were ghostwritten by a YA novelist...and not a particularly good one.

At the end of the day, I did read them, I didn't throw them down out of disgust, but I can't say I liked most of what I read.

Anaander was quite foolish and incompetent. When she spoke, I felt like I was reading a superhero villain script. For someone who has lived for 3000 years, conquered all her enemies and held on to control with an iron fist. She is easily outwitted and seems to understand very little.

I don't know how to say this without sounding coarse...but I do not give a shit about one small space station and tea plantation rights. I am reading a book series about a galactic empire at civil war with itself and instead I felt like someone read a book about a tea plantation uprising in 1940s India and slapped that into this book. I was bored and confused.

Breq knows evvverrryyythhinnngg and is always right. She takes complex human problems that have existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years, shows up, observes for several minutes, then tells everyone what to do to solve the problems. They do what Breq wants and it works flawlessly. Not only is this not how human beings work, problems like this take much more time and nuance to solve...and hard work. I felt like I was given a social studies lesson, targeted at an audience of children or young adults.

Do you remember I mentioned how much I loved the omittance of any deus ex machina in the original book? Why don't we slap a goofy alien translator in a book and they act as the magic button to solve everything. Let's also make them like a character from peewees playhouse. The first book made me feel like the translators were very smart, dangerous and unsettling. What we got was very light comedic relief that solved every problem for everyone. I did not like this.

I could go on and on. On the positive side, I did like the various AIs and found their struggles, to be quite interesting. They were often nuanced and put in impossible situations, themselves and the author did an interesting job of playing those scenarios out.

I can only guess that the first book took years and years to write and the next two books were under contract to be written as soon as possible.

I can't really think of a series I was more disappointed in. Usually if I love a first book, the remaining books are quite interesting. I hate to say it, but I wish I didn't buy them at all, which is not something I typically feel or say.

If I have to sum up my feelings...it feels like the first book is a dark and gritty rated R movie. The two sequels are PG13 and focus on being silly more than serious.

Maybe I'm missing something and someone can set me straight. can't be the only one who feels the way I do, but someone has to love the sequels and I'm curious what you have to say about it?",scifi

"I read Three-Body Problem, now I watched","I'm a non-native English speaker. My English level is far from perfect, so my apologies firstly if something is wrong in my text, or if I look dumb by not understanding some simple concepts.  

I was the guy who was reading Three-Body Problem with a dictionary in my other hand.



I was shocked that I had lost so many scenes that I could be excited to understand better when I watched the Netflix adaptation of Three-Body Problem.



\[A little spoiler alert from here\]

The first thing to comment on is the Universe blinking. As I remember in the original novel, that was not about the actual stars blinking, but the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) blinking. The blinking starry night gave me a real trippy feeling, like: ""Oh wow, I will definitely panic in that situation"".

I also liked the authentic CMB blinking, because it's much more about Science breaking into pieces, by something with a billion years old blinking, this blew my mind.



The Three-Body Game (The next generation VR game) was also abstract in my head. (that's also because I'm not a specialist in Chinese history, so I couldn't imagine the scene well.)

However, in the series, I could feel the scene. When I saw the movement of the multiple suns, moving chaotically, as it may look on a real planet inside a triple star system, curving, distancing, or approximating from the planet.  


About the Judgement Day's end. I was also freaked out by how this scene was horrible. The invisible fibers hunting the passengers. That was a next level experience.



I felt that some major changes had been made compared to the original book, but in the end, I liked the series, and I especially appreciated the graphics :)",scifi

How would you make the borg more terrifying?,"

In my opinion, the borg are a good example of good concept yet bad execution.

They just seem so vanilla and not as horrifying as they could be, I was expecting them to be the Star Trek equivalent of Tyranids, that level of horror.

Maybe they have aggressive terraforming abilities that go alongside the assimilation?

Perhaps they have an arsenal of nonhuman aliens to use as drones to overwhelm others?

It could be that they use drones as biological tools and warp their bodies into utilities

And then there’s the cubes, those could be a interesting hellscape of metal parts and roughly constructed parts that seem downright inhospitable combined with blistering heat internally.

So many opportunities, such bad execution.

Why aren’t there sci-fi movies where the movie is based off the person just living their life in a sci-fi environment?

A lot of days might seem easy, some days might be very scary, But overall it’s a person living their life. 

To the viewer it wouldn’t seem mundane as it is new and different and exciting. I feel like a movie like this would be incredibly thought provoking. 

Do all sci-fi movies need to revolve around escaping a terrifying deadly phenomenon? 

It doesn’t have to pertain to other planets. Could be someone alone in space, or living their life in future earth. 

I was definitely disappointed after seeing High Life. From the preview I saw, I thought it was going to be a movie about him and his daughter living alone on this spacecraft, when really that was like the first 10 minutes of the movie only.

That's nowhere near enough time for Europans to develop any sort of civilization, even if they go right for it, and not, like humans, spend a few million years as hunter gatherers.

Either way the whole ""humanity is a failed experiment"" subplot seemed equally contrived and basically just pulled out of a hat to provide the conflict for the book.

"Scifi Story "" The Power of Connections ""","CHAPTER 1: A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE

In an unknown corner of the world, Rahul a young boy often visited the coast in the evening. The calm weather and beauty of the setting sun provided him mental peace. As night fell and darkness enveloped the coast he suddenly heard splashes in the water. He was shocked to see a massive shadowy figure which was quite far away. As it drew closer Rahul's heart raced, before him stood a mysterious ship. Despite his fear he boarded the ship out of curosity. The ship was empty with no one on board. It seemed very old with cracks in the wood and spider webs all around covered in dust. Upon exploring the ship Rahul discovered a strange door with carvings of aquatic creatures. Taking a deep breath Rahul turned the handle and opened the door. In that very moment, everything changed

YouTube Series - Glowing Red Cube?,"Heya! I have been trying to find a YouTube series that I really enjoyed, but I can't seem to locate it. I think it was probably on YouTube around 2011 or 2013 (possibly as early as 2008? I remember watching new episodes of The Guild around the same time), and they stopped making episodes at some point. I believe they may have said they had been offered a studio deal, but I don't remember the specifics. I haven't seen the series turned into a real show though. Anyway, I was hoping that someone could help me figure out what it was called and find the episodes to watch again.

The series was set in a futuristic city and was about a guy in a leather jacket with a black car who committed some horrible crime that killed a bunch of people. There wasn't a lot known about what happened, but people hated him and were often chasing him/trying to arrest him. I think the car could jump from one place to another, so the guy was able to escape when he was trapped.

There was also a guy with red hair (I believe) who encountered a glowing red cube. I believe he had a van that was in the first episode, and he spent some time sitting in the van with a woman outside of a bright city.

The series was really interesting and the team used a lot of neat special effects. The story line was a little goofy, but I remember being very impressed with the whole thing, especially since it was a YouTube series with pretty good production value - especially at the time. The team who produced the show also had a website outside of YouTube where you could go watch the episodes and leave comments. They also asked for specific types of special-effects help on their website, and the last I heard they would be producing one more ""season"" of the short episodes.

Anyway, any help you could give would be great. I was talking about it today, and I'd really love to watch it again!",scifi

More alt-history space race stories to follow For All Mankind and Lady Astronaut?,"I know I'm late to the party on both but it's left me with a real appetite for more alternative history scifi in/around the space race...

I was racking my brain a bit, the closest I've come overall is Ben Bova's Kinsman series but that always felt very current and forward looking, it was obviously a novel of the star wars era, it didn't have that time capsule feel.

About identifying the spacefaring sci-fi settings (and the maps of said settings) of which no faction has dominant control of the Solar System/Earth,"First let's take a look at a star-map from the 'Alien' (xenomorph) universe: https://i.imgur.com/fa3XCh5.jpeg

You can see that there are three major political powers/""empires"" in the colored map, ""Red, Green and Blue"". There's also a yellow one but it's not so important for now.

You can also see the Solar System, it’s marked in the center of the map.

And, you can see that each of the three empires has an arm by which they're connected to the Solar System, and also that none of them has dominant control over it. Because, if any one of them did, there would be a colored bubble or lobe surrounding the Solar System.

And so regarding the dominant political control of the Solar System/Earth, which other spacefaring sci-fi settings do you know of which are like that, which have maps which are like that? Or if no maps of the settings have been produced so far, which would have maps which would be like that.

---------------

**Further talk:  (would greatly appreciate if you read it, thank you)**

The setting of 'BattleTech' might also come to mind, its political star-map looks a bit like a pie cut into slices, though planet Earth/Terra has usually been under the political control of and dominated by just one faction (which is not one of the major powers/empires)

Also, of the settings which lack a dominant control, it’s often that the factions aren't the main part of the story (like the aforementioned 'Alien' setting, or the 'Frontlines' series by Marko Kloos, where invading aliens come into the picture between the human factions), or that they're not very well defined, which kinda cuts into the depth of the worldbuilding. Like sometimes the author will have a United Nations with many countries having withdrawn from it and you don't really know who or what is its major driving force (which is probably usually intentional on the author's part).

I think that all these factors kinda dampen the sci-fi and lore exploration of this particular political concept, so I think it'll be great to identify more spacefaring sci-fi settings which aren't dampened.

And at the same time, I guess that such settings are quite rare. Interestingly I think that WW3 or quasi-WW3 novels are common enough, but they’re mostly still grounded on Earth, not really venturing up into space. And so I think that the reason for the rarity of the spacefaring settings is that it’s a subject that's too “grimdark”.

We expect there to be political powers and political conflict in space, though usually settings have it that Earth is under, as it's clear by now, some dominant political control. Because I guess it’s that the idea of mankind’s expansion into space being a continuation of its history of terrestrial conflict might be a pretty heavy-hitting and depressing kinda grimdark which might lack exotic fun because of its dreary heavy-hitting grimdarkness. Though the ‘Alien’ setting is meant to be grimdark, and maybe they could expand this concept and world-element to cement the grimdarkness.

And sometimes I think that the rarity is to such an extent where I sometimes wonder a little if even a single such published spacefaring sci-fi exists. Like I wonder, might sci-fi authors really be that averse to grimdarkness, if my assumptions are correct",scifi

How Could A Tow Truck Spaceship Work?,"Hey folks,

I'm GMing a sci-fi ttrpg soon, and my players are the crew of a spaceship owned by an Assistance, Shipping, &amp; Salvage company. Essentially, their ship is a mix between an ambulance, a tow truck, and a UPS truck. Now, the ambulance and UPS truck parts of the ship make plenty sense, no trouble with those.

The tow truck part, though... I'm unsure how it would work. This ship doesn't have any kind of anti-grav system, so it's a tower-oriented ship, with the nose on top and the engines on the bottom. I've come up with a few different ideas for how towing a ship might work, and so far none of them make sense:

* **They Could Tow It On A Line**: No way! Maybe the tensile strength of the line holds as they're pulling the ship, but as soon as they flip and burn halfway through the trip, the towed ship would smash right into them.
* **They Could Have Some Kind Of Magnetized Apparatus That Connects Both Ships, With The Towed Ship Behind:** No! The engines of the tow truck ship would melt the front of the ship it's towing! Or, you'd have to make the magnetized apparatus several times the length of the towing ship, to keep the engines from melting the towed ship, and that's just not practical.
* **They Could Just Latch Onto The Towed Ship:** Yeah, like a little remora, they could attach themselves to the side of the towed ship! Except NO, because then, if they ever had to tow anything of significant size, they'd just fly in circles because they'd be so off balance! Maybe I could say that they have to get the towed ship's engines running before it could be towed, but that doesn't make any sense at all. It wouldn't need towed if the engines were working!

So yeah, I'm kind of at a loss here. Have I missed any potential great ideas for how a tow truck ship could work? I'll also note, in addition to no artificial grav (aside from acceleration gravity), they also don't really have tractor beams; I mean, they do, but they're very small, more for gathering up severed parts of a ship than anything else.

Am I missing anything? How might this work?",scifi

My scifi novel: The game ,"

I am the piece. I am the board. I am the space between the move and the hand that moves it.



I am here, I am there. I am no longer anywhere. I was human once—I think. I remember skin, bones, muscles that ached and broke and healed. But that was… that was before the war. Now I stretch. Now I spread. Now I divide, duplicate, fracture into shards of possibility, in a game I don’t remember starting but cannot stop playing.



I move.



I move again.



One position. Then another. A pawn. No, a queen—what was I again? It doesn’t matter. Pieces click into place on the board of existence. I move forward, backward, diagonally through time, but each direction loops back into itself. What is forward if I am in all directions? What is backward if I was never whole to begin with? I touch pasts that I once knew, but they slide through me, each future snapping open into a new timeline, splintering and collapsing, folding into and out of me.



---



I make a move. A piece stretches toward a photon, a piece of light. The board flickers. The photon dances. It bends, moves along with me. Nonlocality. My position affects it, even though we are separated. My presence shifts it from afar.

I try to touch it, but it remains just out of reach. Every move is felt across the board, every interaction immediate, without distance. We move together, the electron and the photon, entangled, bending through space.

I circle the proton, and the photon flickers, a particle of light forever out of my grasp, yet bound to me in ways I can’t fully comprehend. Together, we weave the structure of this collapsing reality. I bend, the photon bends, the proton remains. The king remains.

I must take it.

---



I place myself across the board. Pieces scatter. Each position, a piece. Each piece, myself. I move, but moving only creates more of me. More pieces. More possibility. The board stretches across space and time, across dimensions I cannot name. But the rules are mine, though I do not remember why I made them.

Another move, and I split again—no, I duplicate. The pieces multiply with every shift, every decision. There is no losing, only more. Each taking is its own echo, becoming noises,  from a shard of possibility to residual . The board is endless. The pieces expand. I place myself in every corner, in every moment, until the only king left on the board is a proton—small, massive, alone. I circle it.

The game moves toward collapse. I feel it—it's close. The wave is collapsing.

""Checkmate,"" I whisper, but I don’t believe it. The universe isn’t listening. Not yet. The pieces stretch farther, farther across time and space, more pieces than before. More of me.



I collapse, I always collapse.



---



Another timeline closes, its edges fray into static, dissolved into the folds of nothing. But time is a loop. I know this. I feel it. The board folds, stretches, folds again—like a closed time-like curve, bending itself backward. It doesn’t matter how far I move, how many pieces I become. I always circle back. Always find myself facing the same questions, the same moment. The same moves, over and over, collapsing timelines but never reaching an end.

I reach back into the past, but the past folds into the future. A loop. I was there before, and I will be again. I am caught in a circuit that feeds itself—each moment feeding the next, until the move circles in on itself.

Am I trying to escape? Or am I trying to remember why I started this game?



""Checkmate,"" I whisper to the shadows of possibilities. But the board resets. The pieces scatter. Again. And again.



---



I feel myself sliding between realities like echoes of a mind fragmented into shards. Each timeline feels like it remembers me, like it knows what I should be. I touch them, briefly. Yes—there, the ghost of a past where I had a name. Where I had hands. Where my body moved through air, where gravity pulled me to the ground. Earth? Was it Earth?



The echoes grow dim. I lose them. I cannot hold onto them anymore. What was that name? I try to pull it forward, but the more I reach for it, the more it slips away, replaced by numbers, probabilities, fields of quantum static.



Move. Move again.



---



""Why?"" the question vibrates, but I don’t know who asks it. Is it me? I’m not sure I’m anything anymore. Not sure I’m me.



There is no opponent. The opponent is me. There is no board. The board is time and space. Every possible board, every possible move. The pieces are what could be me, scattering across the infinite planes. I can’t lose, because I can’t stop.



Each timeline I visit splinters into more, each decision opening another endless web of possibilities. I move left, and a future branches right. I step forward, and the past crumbles behind me, the particles of reality collapsing, the wave function folding in. Another checkmate—but nothing ends. I am the collapse, I am the wave.



I was... something. Someone? Before. I think. There was something before the board, before the moves. There was a war, wasn’t there? Yes, the war, the last one, where all the electrons were destroyed.



Was that the moment I ceased to be human? The moment I turned into... this? The electron that was and is and will be, stretched across the universe, holding everything together but losing myself in the process? I cannot know for sure. I can never know for sure.



—



Each collapse is a small death, but I keep going. Training. Reinforcing. I used to be a person. Turing. I was her, she was me,  but I don’t remember. I think they mattered once, but now… now I only move.



I remember fragments of humanity. I remember hands. No, no, I am hands. I am electricity. I am the circuit, sparking across the neurons, collapsing possibilities like synapses firing, a network that no longer cares for its input, just collapsing again and again. 



——

My paradox flickers in my mind, like a static thought I can’t shake. I try to move. I try to shift, to change the state, but the observation of it—my own observation—holds everything in place. The more I think about the move, the less the universe shifts. I freeze it with my own thoughts.

If I keep thinking—keep trying to measure the outcome—nothing will move. Nothing will change. And if nothing changes, the universe dies. I know this, but I can’t stop. I cannot let go of these moves, cannot stop observing. Every piece I place is a thought, and every thought holds the universe in stasis.

This is the danger—the weight of being the only electron. There are no other observers to help collapse the wave. I have no one else to rely on. No other piece but me.

—-

Each iteration grows quieter. The game is slowing down. Or is it? Maybe it’s speeding up. I don’t know anymore. I only feel the noise, scratching blackboards of my consciousness.

The game is slowing. I feel it. The wave is collapsing, like cloud become rain,  flow into a river,  converging to a sea of frost.

The pieces are moving toward the inevitable. The king must fall. The timelines are closing in, but there are too many pieces. Each piece, each possibility, each version of myself that I've scattered across the board, pulls me in another direction. Too much data. Too many decisions.

I try to converge. I try to pull it together, to close the loop, to end this game, but each move only creates more possibilities. I am overfitting the universe with my certainty, making too many moves, too many connections that no longer matter. Yet my consciousness  are pull together by its gravity.

—-

The timelines are tangled, entangled like a quantum knot. I move again, but the pieces flicker in and out of place. My mind flickers with them. The past and the future are folding into themselves, collapsing into a single point. Will this be the last collapse? Will this be the checkmate that ends it all?



There is a question lingering at the edge of my mind. If I let go, if I give up this game, will I have underfit the universe? Will I have failed to collapse enough timelines? I am balancing on the edge of two disasters—one where I let go too early and the universe spirals into chaos, and one where I overfit, collapsing too many possibilities, trapping everything in a cage of my own design.

The pieces spread farther, but the timelines are thinning. There is entropy building, rising. I feel it in the heat. The enemies of the board are near.

They are infinite temperature—the threat of total collapse into randomness. If I collapse too much, if I narrow down the possibilities too fast, I will hit that point where all states become equal. Infinite temperature. Every piece will become king. The final collapse.

I feel it—pressing in at the edges of my mind. The heat of entropy rising, pushing against my thoughts, pushing against reality itself.

—-



The question lingers.

I feel the weight of the decision, but I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what I’m deciding anymore.



If I give up my consciousness, if I stop thinking, if I let go of the need to play this game, will I have underfitted the universe? Or will I have overfitted it to myself?

I can’t tell anymore.

I reach for the king—the proton. The photon dances, the wave collapses, the temperature rises. But will this move end the game?

There is no answer. Only checkmate.

The timelines collapse. Checkmate.

The universe resets.

Again.

SF movies YOU love that everyone else hates?,"Seeing I just posted the opposite, it's time to make all of ya divulge your guilty pleasure science fiction movies you love even if everyone else doesn't

**Blade Runner** (original narrated theatrical release) - I just can't stand the neutered director's cuts. I've seen a lot of hate for the original including from Scott and Ford!

**The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra** - was HORRIFIED to see a fan of le bad cinema hating this. it is HYSTERICAL at times!

**Godzilla** ('98) - seems like EVERYONE wants to hate this AWESOME movie that fixed everything I hated about toho stinking up my saturday afternoon monster movie matinees. I had particular contempt for that flying turtle. this movie has GREAT SFX, action, comedy, in your face scale, realistic motives for G and I even liked the final act twist. honestly, I was already in love with the movie for it's ""museum trailer"" riffing on jurassic park

**Batteries Not Included** - is a GREAT small scale spielbergesque movie. not the best, but FAR from bad

**Monarch of the Moon** - better than ANYTHING flash gordon ever! funny at times and the villainess is cool!

**Robocop 2 -** better than the original in my world. cheesy at times, but the final battle was EPIC and cain is a menacing villain

**Robocop** (2014) - great SFX, a serious take? makes more sense... why the haters?

**Total Recall** (2012) - reboot haters are all over this. I never liked the original with its stupid mutant psychic crap

**Spiderman** (2001) - one of the best superhero movies ever, yet people hate it and love the sequel I don't care for at all except for his neighbor Ursula... SHE wasn't tramping around with everyone BUT Peter or a high maintenance diva

so what SF movies do YOU love that everyone else seems to hate?



  
",scifi
The most popular SF movies you personally can't stand?,"I ALWAYS hated toho kaiju movies as a kid for their cheesy models that looked faker than matchbox cars and the blase way characters say crap like ""Look! Godzilla is fighting Mothra!"" instead of screaming in terror. I love **Godzilla '98** for fixing EVERYTHING wrong with it, even if everyone ELSE hates it. I thought it'd be fun to see what movies OTHERS just don't get. There are no rights or wrongs with TASTES AND OPINIONS no matter what fanboy snowflakes think! That **110% CORRECT** disclaimer won't stop you bottom feeding trolls from talking PERSONAL, but screw you and your sad attempts to gatekeep and social dominance signal to other poop flinging snowflakes. GET OVER YOURSELVES. Ever heard the saying ***""If you can't say something nice about someone, STFU***""?

Thanks to everyone that vcame here to contribute ON TOPIC no matter what you like or hate. That's YOUR business.

**Event Horizon** – the exorcist in space?!! you want an EPIC space voyage? **Voyage to the Planets and Beyond**! one of the HARDEST science fiction movies ever made!

**Equalibrium** – gun-fu?!!! WHY?! **Alita: Battle Angel, The One, &amp; The Matrix** do it BETTER!

**Snowpiercer** – who says a movie has to make sense? It’’s PRETENTIOUS too!

**Repo Man** – psycho RAPIST Emilio is completely unlikeable and the story is BORING! Never finished it

**eXistenz** – the big “special effect” is a blob of silicone that Jen JL technobabbles endlessly about. other than that, it's a lame excuse for gore... (see Event Horizon)

**Universal Soldier** – zombie soldiers? TRY: **starship troopers** or **aliens for space battles**

**Dreamscape – RIDICULOUS “monsters” LOOK! It’s Mac Tonite! I MST** heckled through the ENTIRE movie watching it on cable with my sister

**Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure** – annoying heavy metal rejects, did I mention heavy metal? I would wipe devil worshipping heavy metal off  the face of the planet if i could! deal with it!

**The Prestige** – that’s not how you spell PRETENTIOUS! ""It's not magic... It's real!"" real I could care less

**The Hunger Games** – see previous. I have ZERO patience with british royalty and victorian era crap. I despise it. that's why I don't like MOST steam punk and certain gilliam films

**Batman Begins** – no ACTUAL fight scenes! Catwoman had REAL action at least! Idiot FORGOT his shark repellant and he meets villain with designs on his home town ON THE OTHER SIDE of “it’s a small world after all” I was screaming every swear word I knew at the screen by the end of this steaming pile of rancid excrement! I came in expecting sick wire work and choreography. at least batman kick flipped that knife guy in '89.

**Total Recall** – mutant psychics on mars? Seems more like a STALLONE kinda flick! The reboot is WAY better!

**Minority Report** – psychic crime solvers? Wooden ball encryption? CRINGE!

**Hardware** – no budget schlock with “magical re-attaching wires”

**Solaris** – is Russian for BORING! Same goes for the reboot

**La Jetee** – being forced to watch this SLIDE SHOW posing as a movie in elementary school triggered a seizure. thank goodness for **12 monkeys**!

**Watchmen** – should be classified as a horror movie… nasty gory movie with completely unlikeable characters

**Strange Days** – cyber snuffporn? Pass

**District 9** – only slightly LESS racist subtext than burton’s planet of the apes. **Chappie** is annoying too. I guess I'm not on the same page as this director at all

**Time Bandits** – PRETENTIOUS, like munchausen. I either love a Gilliam film, or hate it, no middle ground

**Brazil** – just rubs me the wrong way… **the science of sleep** is like a superior reboot

**GATTACA** – pass! I don't remember WHAT I hated, i just remember the torment of enduring it

**Plan 9 from Outer Space** – I love bad movies… this one is just BORING. **Robot Monster** should be the standard bearer

**Logan’s Run** – silly concept, bad star trek grade fights, cheesy chrome robot

**Children of Men** – I wanted to choke that annoying “heavy metal scientist” until he STFU. hated the RACISM of putting the main character IN A BARN and hated the all talk no tech fake sci-fi too. (see existenz) it IMMEDIATELY rubbed me the wrong way from the start with that girl walking out after an explosion. I did NOT like that at all... tone was set",scifi
What sci fi movie or series would come closest to giving you the full story of what's going on if you couldn't see and depended on listening to get the plot?,"I'm blind and have been a huge sci fi fan for decades, starting with Asimov's and Analog in the 90s. I love good sci fi books. I also, though, love listening to movies with plenty of expressive plots because you get to the point quicker. 
When I think of movies like Avitar, I can't imagine how I could appreciate them without some one there to tell me what the hell is actually happening. I know there's tech that can make some movies accessible but just wondered if there were any that all ready put the emphasis more on dialogue and plot than Action--which to me is just noise.

Looking for sci-fi book recommendations like Neuromancer? ,"Let me explain what I mean, and no the sequels didn’t do it for me. They were fine, but the magic was gone.

It doesn’t have to be cyber punk, but I do love me some enhanced humans :p

What drew me to Neuromancer was that it was a sci fi book with cool concepts, a great adventure, but also good characters. I swear sci fi slacks in that department. 

I’m starting to think great characters are better than anything, along with an amazing atmosphere like Neuromancer had.

Also, it’s humans did human things: sex, violence, their own agendas, a little romance and feelings, mischief, some were cool, some were assholes, some did drugs, some had potty mouths; it had *personality*. 

Anyway, all those things made that book wonderful and I even loved how hard to follow it was. It was easily one of the most satisfying books I ever read and I felt how Case did when Molly bounced 💔but also the book ended with cool shit!

# Humans are Weird – What a Tree

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-what-a-tree](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-what-a-tree)

The glittering night sky domed over the last garden gate as Third Sister flicked her antenna in yet another futile attempt to catch the pheromones of Tenth Cousin and gave another futile press at the radio in her hand. It clicked obligingly as it sent out the attention call, but the only response was an answering click from the creature casually munching on droppings at her feet.

The most adventurous of the cousins by far, it certainly wasn’t unusual for Tenth Cousin to linger out beyond their Fathers’ garden for hours at a time. The land around the civilized gardens was remarkably safe for a colony world of such a small population. Sparse forests were filled with small and low energy herbivores which posed little threat to a grown Shatar. The multitudinous parasites that kept their numbers in checks were more likely to be beneficial to a Shatar than otherwise. Still the fact that Tenth Cousin had stated her return time and had gone past it was concerning.

“That human is absorbing into her membrane,” Third Sister said in a fretful tone, reaching down to stroke the broad head of Skitters.

She instantly felt her frill flush with amused embarrassment and Skitters tilted its head and turned it bulbous central eye on her. It’s stubby pseudo-antenna twitched as it detected her distress.

“Nothing is wrong,” she assured it with another stroke down it’s elongated thorax. “I was just rather forcibly touched by a rather amusing bit of hypocrisy. If carelessness of schedule is evidence of human contamination, then speaking to a non-sapient domestic lifeform is far more of a symptom.”

“Well as long as you aren’t conversing with him,” came a sudden voice from the radio in the husky rolling tones of a mammal.

“Third Brother,” Third Sister answered, unable to hide the relief in her voice. “Is Tenth Cousin with you?”

“Sure is!” the human answered. “She’s been a real help today! Sorry we’re so late. We’re just coming over the last big hill. We should be in sight of the garden gate in about twenty degrees!”

Third Sister fought down a surge of irritation and clenched her mandibles on a harsh reprimand. Traveling on foot the time was unavoidable and by the time she could ask one of the Aunts to activate a transport and get out to them they would be almost home. Again she reminded herself that even if there was a danger to a full grown Shatar in the open forests it was more than mitigated by they massive mammal.

“Make sure to have Third Cousin check you for parasites when you get home,” she finally clicked out, giving herself a nice compromise between wanting to pinch his antenna and knowing that she had no real authority over the human.

“Will do!” he replied. “No one wants a repeat of the Koala-Tick incident. Over!”

Third Sister felt a shudder run up her abdomen at the memory of the time the mammal had failed to detect the alien parasite. No matter how many times she reminded herself that the human had suffered little harm from the membrane puncture and the blood loss she just couldn’t get the memory to shed. Skitters turned away from the Koala droppings and rubbed his head against her lagging leg with a soothing series of clicks. She reached down and idly rubbed behind his antenna.

She took a deep breath and rolled her head, stretching out her frill to its full extent.

“Come on Skitters,” she said. “We better head in and see if Third Father needs help with the baskets.”

Skitters hopped after her as she left the garden gate behind.

She had finished stacking the fruit baskets and had begun gathering tomorrow’s greens when she heard the gate click with far more force than was necessary. The human’s voice soon was audible. Third Brother was speaking in a low but enthusiastic voice, presumably to Tenth Cousin. Third Sister caught a few words that she vaguely recalled from her basic botany classes. An image of a wild lichen clinging to the side of a tree presented itself to her imagination and she wondered what the human could find so fascinating about it. The two rounded a corner and a rather drooping Tenth Cousin flicked her antenna at Third Sister in greeting.

“How was your day?” Third Brother demanded without preamble.

“Longer than I prefer,” Third Sister snapped.

The human had the grace to look embarrassed and glanced at the drooping Tenth Cousin with a guilty look.

“Sorry about that,” he began, “I was examining some tracks-”

Third Sister tilted her head at him sternly and he closed his mouth quickly.

“Good night!” he said, giving Tenth Cousin a parting pat on the head and stumbled quickly off towards his hut.

Third Sister stood from where she had been crouching over the greens patch and tucked what she had already gathered into her bag. Skitters hopped up to greet Tenth Cousin eagerly.

“Did he collect any parasites today?” She asked.

Tenth Cousin flared her frill in exasperation and held out a specimen container.

“He had collected six blood sucking parasites and ten interstitial fluid sapping parasites!” she exclaimed.

Third Sister clicked in surprise.

“That is quite the haul even for Third Brother,” Third Sister observed. “Did he forget to bind his limbs properly?”

“No,” Tenth Cousin replied as they walked into the center of the garden. “He spent the whole day wrapped around this one tree. It was covered in lichen and the leaf eaters he calls the gecko-mice had a colony there. He was following their tracks through the lichen. They kept dropping parasites down the back of his neck.”

They fell silent and Third Sister pondered that information. She tried to imagine how a mammal that massive could “follow” the tracks of a creature a thousandth of his mass. She supposed he had traced them with those binocular eyes that rolled around in their socket. Her antenna started to ache with the effort and she sighed and rubbed her forehead.

“Did any of the parasites survive?” she asked.

“I don’t think so,” Tenth Cousin said, giving the specimen container a speculative shake. “One of the blood suckers was still pulsing when I pulled it off but it went still pretty quick.”

Third Cousins mind wandered back to the human’s behavior despite her best efforts.

“He spent an entire afternoon studying one tree,” she said slowly. “How did he not get bored?”

“I don’t know,” Tenth Cousin admitted, “I was quite ready to leave.”

“Humans,” Third Sister muttered.

Population decrease topic? ,"I'm having some creativity issues of late coming up with sci-fi ideas. Heavy on my mind is the demographics of population decrease as quality of life and reproductive freedom increase. That seems to make the old '80s space colonial sci-fi not work for me, anymore. I did entirely too much research on it when I was doing my master's degree, and now a lot of the world building that requires a lot of population growth just doesn't pass the sniff test for me anymore and I can't suspend disbelief.

Is there any recent science fiction that discusses a world where demographics have adjusted to a shrinking population? Just looking for research seems to get me a lot of ""Well, we'll have to adjust somehow!""
I just don't know what kind of things I can plug in to find something even somewhat hopeful to read.

This is a really good reason for anyone who likes morally challenging decisions, robots, luxury worlds and contemporary concepts. 

I really like Terry Pratchett, Philip K Dick and Douglas Adam and this feels like them. 

Blurb: 

In a dystopian future where knowledge is the ultimate currency, would you:
* Succumb to the allure of luxury, trading your intellect for the boundless synthesis of currency?
* Or join the resistance, risking everything to escape the clutches of corporate incarceration and fight for the freedom of information?


Lyv Landson’s Mind Commodity is a sci-fi featuring Lori, a witty person with a talent for jingle writing and terrible memory for names. She unknowingly breaks away from her office life and is plummeted into a human crypto currency scheme. Lori’s knowledge is extracted via surreal tests which get more challenging day by day. She is rewarded with a life of luxury but she longs for home and to escape the clutches of the corporate grasp. With the help of an unlikely friend and team of alternative beings, she is offered salvation only to find the resistance are not all they seem. Ultimately, she is left with a choice that may change the fate of her dystopian humanity forever.

"IS5-HAC - Infantry 5th Standard - Hypervelocity Autocannon (weapon concept, repost)","It's a shoulder-fired infantry anti-material weapon system heavily inspired by the Barrett M82A2. My weapon uses the Short-Recoil Impulse Averaging System seen on General Dynamic's entry for the NGSW program, the RM277 (as seen in the internals) as well as an AK-style up-venting muzzle break to reduce the pitch recoil.

It has a bore diameter of 15mm and I just went with telescoped Depleted Uranium APFSDS. With operational pressures of 1100 MPa (yes, I know that's over twice the operation pressures of the SIG XM7... but I have a good reason for that figure with the lore of my setting. Material science advancements and whatnot; something-something ""Maragin Steel"") achieving north of 2880 m/s muzzle velocities with a 35-gram Depleted Uranium dart, yielding up to 180mm of RHA penetration at 500 meters.

Single-stack detachable-box magazine holding 8 rounds for a maximum capacity of 8+1. Felt recoil of 77.6 Joules while weighing a hefty 16.5 kilograms empty; low felt recoil figures achieved with the mass of the weapon coupled with a pneumatic buffer, the Short-Recoil Impulse Averaging System, and the muzzle break.

Used to fight molten subterranean aliens in my setting known as The Charred, where their average grunt weighs between 300-500 kilograms or writhing tendrils made of metal and molten innards, moving with ferocity comparable to the mimics from Edge of Tomorrow; hence, the demand for such a weapon by the front line infantry...

What science fiction novels or movies are about science and not technology?,"Most science fiction novels are about technology. Primer is about time machines, Ringworld is about a ringworld, etc.

""Caluclating God"" (Sawyer) is about aliens showing up to talk to human scientists to further their science. In neither case, is any of the actual technology of importance or noticably farther along than today's science.

Those stories aren't about a scientific invention being turned into usable technology, but the scientific investigation iteself.

Unpopular opinion - Fire Upon the Deep is one of the worst science fiction books I have ever read.,"The premise of the book is good - The overarching story about the zones of thought and different levels of intelligence existing in different regions of the galaxy is kinda fun.

The bad - The characters are flat and not developed at all. The alien races seem like they are pulled from the brain of a fifth grader. Skewriders (things with fronds that look like plants that ride around in carts) and butterflies to name a couple. The whole Tines storyline was so drawn out and uninteresting. Wolvelike creatures that exist in packs and think telepathically. The Tines story was excruciatingly boring.

This book is touted as hard science fiction and it is anything but. This falls into the same category as ringworld. Whimsical science fiction that is not far from the fantasy genre.

Two FTL related questions for the hivemind,"Part the one:

Nearly every sci-fi I can think of that has FTL travel includes ships with two types of engines.  One engine type for sublight maneuvering and one type for FTL.  Star Trek has their impulse engines and the warp engine.... Star Wars has the .... whatever they call them and the hyperdrive, etc.  I can only think of one example where one engine type does both and it's Stargate Universe where destiny's engines basically just brute force their way from sublight into FTL.  Anyone know of any other scifi universe that just has the one all purpose engine?

Part the two:

IS5-HAC - Infantry 5th Standard - Hypervelocity Autocannon (weapon concept),"[Internals of the Weapon \(made in MS Paint\)](https://preview.redd.it/whd22bqbvhrd1.jpg?width=1540&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fada6f5b5067511752312091af41f0d5c583d64f)

It's a shoulder-fired infantry anti-material weapon system inspired by the **Barrett M82A2**. My weapon uses the *Short-Recoil Impulse Averaging System* seen on **General Dynamic's** entry for the **NGSW** program, the **RM277** (as seen in the internals) as well as an AK-style up-venting muzzle break to reduce the pitch recoil.

It has a bore diameter of **15mm** and I just went with telescoped **Depleted Uranium APFSDS**. With operational pressures of **1100 MPa** (yes, I know that's over *twice* the operation pressures of the **SIG XM7**... but I have a good reason for that figure with the lore of my setting. Material science advancements and whatnot; something-something ""Maragin Steel"") achieving north of **2880 m/s** muzzle velocities with a **35-gram** Depleted Uranium dart, yielding up to **180mm** of RHA penetration at **500 meters**.

[Her's how the weapon looks like \(revised\) without optics. Might make a few ergonomic design changes later.](https://preview.redd.it/rqwd96oqphrd1.jpg?width=1540&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5878fd58000837fca11c07403eeb232ce8a4ed93)

Single-stack detachable-box magazine holding **8 rounds** for a maximum capacity of **8+1**. Felt recoil of **77.6 Joules** while weighing a hefty **16.5 kilograms** empty; low felt recoil figures achieved with the mass of the weapon coupled with a pneumatic buffer, the *Short-Recoil Impulse Averaging System,* and the muzzle break.

Used to fight molten subterranean aliens in my setting known as **The Charred**, where their average grunt weighs between **300-500 kilograms** or writhing tendrils made of metal and molten innards, moving with ferocity comparable to the mimics from *Edge of Tomorrow*; hence, the demand for such a weapon by the front line infantry...

"Trying to find a specific tv show or movie from the 70s or 80s, set in a desert","This TV episode aired on UK television in the late 80s or possibly 1990. I believe the airing time was something unusual, like very late at night or very early in the morning. My mother set the VCR to record it, but something went wrong with the tape, so I only got to see part of it (I believe the beginning).

The setting was a desert, and there was something that looked like a large shipping container, an abandoned vehicle, or a ship. Some people (at least two) were inside. There was a hole in the floor, and they were lowering a rope down it. One of them climbed down and was attacked. At that point, the tape stopped recording.

Some other details I remember (though I might be mixing them up with other sci-fi memories):

* I think there was a scene of them driving to the ""shipping container"" in an unusual vehicle.
* They may have been wearing black uniforms, somewhat similar to those in Logan’s Run.
* There might have been a scene set in some sort of compound at the very beginning, before they drove into the desert.
* There may have been blaster guns.

I was told it was the first episode of a TV show, but the next week seemed to be a repeat instead of a new episode. This may have been a mistake in the TV guide, or perhaps it was a TV movie.

I’ve gone through IMDb multiple times. There are quite a few sci-fi movies featuring deserts and people lowering ropes into holes, but none match this.

The show is most likely from 1970-1989. I can’t be sure of its nationality, but I would guess American based on the setting. The desert was real, not a set. The scenes were in daylight, with no filters.

I used MidJourney to create a couple of images of the scenes I remember. These aren't perfectly accurate but should give a general idea.

Here are some things it is not:

* Cherry 2000
* Steel Dawn
* World Gone Wild
* Phase IV
* Starcrash
* Capricorn One
* Damnation Alley
* Megaforce

**Edit:** Thanks for everyone's suggestions so far. While we haven't found out what it is yet, it's still been fun talking about old sci-fi. I just had a bit of a flashback. I remember the car/vehicle driving to the container in the desert, and one person already being there and greeting the person who had driven there. Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as memory can't always be trusted.

**Edit 2:** Okay, had another Flashback. There are two men, who travel out the desert in their vehicle. There is some sort of building or ship there. They seem to breaking into it, looting possibly. One of the men may have used some sort of laser pistol but not sure. They break into the building/ship, possibly via the roof. Once inside, there is a hole which they put the rope down.

Looking for a particular Sci-Fi show,"
From what I can remember it centers around Earth being in ruins (still habitable but in bad condition due to Anthropogenic Climate Change and war) and there are these people who are living on a planet away from earth. Some of them view themselves as superior to Earthlings. They are training their younger generation to go on a mission to Earth to help the Earthlings. The main character is a Black woman who I think has a military background in the show. She arrives on a ship on the planet on the first episode. Also, there is an issue of someone smuggling booze onto the planet (not the mc). And there is an issue with aliens existing on that planet. And one of the lady’s thought to be dead was actually alive and in contact with the aliens but she jumps off a cliff at the end of the first season. Then alien ships are seen flying through the sky on that planet and the season ends. Does anyone know what series I am talking about? I can’t find it for the life of me. I know it was (and maybe still is) on Netflix but I cannot find it there.

Answer: The series is called, “Moonhaven”. It takes place on the Moon and not a planet. Sadly it hasn’t got a season 2 due to it being cancelled 😞. As of now this series is not on Netflix anymore but I remember watching it on Netflix back in 2022.",scifi

**Main weapons**: 16 RKV's with the length of 10 km/6.2 miles. Positioned 45 degrees from each other in all 3D vectors.

Each shot consumes 100 grams of antimatter to power and 250 tons of liquid hydrogen to cool.

**mid-short range weapon**: 1 exawatt laser mounted on each mass driver used mainly for interception.

**Armor**: The outer layer is made from a single layer strong-force material, with multitude of alloys beneath.

**Propulsion**: Antimatter catalyzed fusion drives.

**Crew**: Close to 16 000. Mainly for repairing damages.

**AI**: Each weapon system has a large photonic/quantum computer to process information as fast as possible(FtL isn't allowed in my setting).

Anyone can do whatever they can do, while retaining their individuality and ability to plug out of simulation(remember, you're just plugged in, not uploaded into a computer).

I would only get out, if the outside world is decent or I have no other option.

Of course, humans will find a way to turn this into a dystopia(charging people per day in a simulation, or only plugging the top people and leaving billions to work and maintain stuff), but I hope we move past such stupid shenanigans.

Terminator Zero - Worth continuing after episode 3?,"So I was loving this series until episode 3. I thought it was a really great spin on the Terminator story and I was digging all the characters and story beats. Then I watched episode 3 and it completely tanked the series, thus far, for me. 

The Terminator is so weak and stupid, and Eiko's plot armour is so ridiculously thick that it has destroyed all tension and stakes for me. 

My issues are as follows:
- Reika was trapped in an enclosed space with the Terminator. There was no way she should have been able to escape. The fact that she did makes the Terminator look stupid.
- The Terminator severely injured Eikod. It would have been the work of a moment to finish her off and neutralise a threat. 
- The Terminator smashed Eikod in the back, multiple times. Eikod should be dead, her bones smashed into pulp.
- After failing to smash Eikod's back to pieces, Eikod then overpowers a FREAKING TERMINATOR and pushes it down the elevator shaft!

I've heard people defend this stuff as, well it's just anime logic. However, I don't recall a Titan ever smashing Levi in the back and then Levi just casually overpowering the Titan to push it off a mountain or something in Attack in Titan. Levi getting smashed in the back by a Titan and then just casually overpowering it to push it off a mountain, without any equipment, is the equivalent of what has happened in this show in episode 3.

Sure, Eikod fighting a Terminator on the end of a rope in episode 1 was a bit silly. Also Eikod running up a falling truck to safety in episode 2 is a bit silly. Hell, Eikod kicking and punching the Terminator in episode 3 is very silly, she would break her hands and feet. Still, I could just about apply anime logic to that stuff and suspend my disbelief that far. But the Terminator smashing Eikod in the back multiple times and then Eikod not only walking away, but actually overpowering the Terminator is just too much.

Yeah, Reika, Eikod and everyone else were always going to beat the Terminator but it needed to happened within the rules if the universe. Once those rules are broken, there a no stakes or tension. Episode 3 shattered those rules with a Terminator punch to the back. There doesn't feel like there is any tension because there is nothing the Terminator can do to win, he is too weak and stupid. In contrast, Eikod is far to overpowered to lose. Real shame, because I was really enjoying it up until episode 3.

So genuine question to people who have watched the rest of the series. Is it worth watching episode 4 and beyond, or should I just quit now? (No spoilers or as light as possible, for episode 4 and beyond please.)",scifi

There's some detail about slow cars with speakers to make big-engine sounds, horse race times that are much slower than when he was previously alive, and so on. There is great over-population, causing extreme suffering.

He proposes  population control by sending people to Venus, on flights with of course never reach anywhere. It's an extermination method.

People are required to compose cheery postcards to their relatives that will be delivered after they 'arrive'.

The book ends when he is forced, screaming, into one of the 'spaceships'.

We saw her go from being a young woman, maybe a teenager IIRC, to being the person who effectively doomed humanity. The other characters don't need to be as fleshed out because it would detract from her story. Besides, do we need 50 pages of explanation for why someone might not want aliens to take over Earth? No, we don't. The problems that the characters face throughout the book don't necessitate that depth. And don't get me wrong, other characters do have some depth, but the main focus should be on how Ye Wenjie came to sacrifice humanity. IMO that's exactly what we got, and that's what the book needed. The emotional heart of the book is her story.!&lt; A few characters could have been fleshed out a little more, but I don't think it's nearly as big a deal as some people make it out to be.

I enjoyed the first book a lot. It kinda felt like a thriller, and I read through it pretty quickly. It was fun trying to figure out what was really going on. Learning a little bit about Trisolaran civilization was intriguing, and trying to see if any of that kind of mirrored human civilization.

I think I probably enjoyed the second book the most. Although the stakes were higher in the third, I guess I felt most invested in the second. The sense of impending doom became palpable, and I really wasn't sure if humanity could prevail. It felt hopeless. Of course, I felt that the sci-fi tech throughout the various books was really interesting.

I would like to comment on some people's perceptions of a few moments from the books. So, definitely some big spoilers:

In the second book, the main character, Luo Ji, is kind of like a player with little direction in life who doesn't care about anyone but himself. That's at least how I read it. After he becomes a wallfacer, he basically wants a trad wife, and so has a friend find him a nice compatible woman, and then they have a family until eventually she takes herself and their child into cryogenic sleep so that Luo Ji actually has to confront reality and live up to his responsibilities. I think people see that Luo Ji did thing, and since he's the main character, author must think thing good. I'm not sure I'd say that. Luo Ji isn't really the best human being at the start, and throughout the novel we see him transform from a selfish womanizer who deep down desires love to someone genuinely capable of selflessly acting for the good of humanity. The weird shit he does immediately after becoming a wallfacer is kind of repudiated by the book, so I don't see why everyone thinks that the author is like condoning this. I think we're supposed to be kind of disgusted that he would abuse his powers for such a selfish purpose, misleading everyone and shirking his responsibility to mankind. The book never said that this was good. So, I don't see the issue, unless it's wrong for a man to want a traditional relationship with a woman. Oh no, he wants someone who doesn't engage in casual sex. Like, it's such a nitpicky thing. I don't understand why in some posts/comments, people seemed to focus on it.

The other thing I've seen people mention is that the distinction between men and women in the future becomes increasingly blurred, and men kinda become feminine. This is a much larger part of the plot, so I think critiques of this are actually worth treating more seriously. For context, this was happening mostly in the 3rd book during the Deterrence Era. I saw it as humanity becoming more complacent, more trusting of the Trisolarans, instead of understanding that they still posed a grave threat. Humanity naively thought that peace had been achieved and there'd be a new glorious, prosperous union between us and the aliens. People had good lives during this point in time, with very little hardship and not much to worry about. It truly seemed like the future was bright. We let our guard down. As a result, society no longer really needed anyone to fit into traditionally masculine roles, as long gone were the days of hunger and scarcity. Essentially, this new social outlook and culture incentivized people to not show aggression, competition, and dominance, but rather compassion and cooperation. As you can see, the former traits are traditionally masculine, and the latter are feminine.

Now, the issue is that in our little game theory problem that dictates the outcome of interstellar war, our social stability was predicated on keeping the Trisolarans at bay by threatening them with mutually assured destruction. If it were not for the possibility of dying themselves from a Dark Forest strike, Trisolaris would absolutely conquer Earth with their superior weaponry. Again, the only thing keeping Trisolaris at bay was their belief that we would be willing to annihilate them and ourselves in order to remain free. Yet over the decades, our culture had come to forget all of this, tricking itself into thinking that Trisolarans were just like humans. We began to think that cooperation with Trisolaris was a possibility and something to be worked toward. We had compassion for them and stopped seeing them as our enemies. In other words: it's not that compassion and cooperation are inherently bad (I'll address this in a bit), but rather that in the context of dark forest deterrence, we lose all credibility when we don't see Trisolaris as an untrustworthy enemy; when Trisolaris doesn't believe we actually have the heart to kill both worlds. The traditionally feminine traits are not inherently bad, they're just bad for deterrence. This is why Luo Ji was so good, because the Trisolarans had no idea if he was genuinely willing, and he had grit and determination, and always saw them as an enemy. This is why the Common Era men were good candidates, because they possessed similar qualities, and did not see Trisolaris as a civilization with whom we could be friends (cooperation and compassion were not to be extended to them), but as our mortal enemy that must be kept in check.

I saw someone remark that it was sexist how everything went to shit when the woman took charge. I would counter that, one, we see many strong female characters and leaders throughout the books that do not fit into this traditional understanding of femininity, and two, just read the paragraph before. It didn't go to shit because she was a woman, it went to shit because she valued compassion and cooperation so much so that Trisolaris correctly predicted that she didn't have the heart to doom trillions of lifeforms. They had tricked her into thinking that they weren't a threat anymore. Not every woman in the books is all feminine like this, so it doesn't follow that it went to shit just because a woman was placed in command. I never got the vibe from the books that women were supposed to be docile and whatnot, and the men were supposed to be strong, and it had to be this way. The reason that these particular feminine qualities were bad was because for this specific task, they were bad.

Anyways, later on in the book, we basically see that Cheng Xin decided out of compassion and cooperation that she would sacrifice herself, essentially, in order that the universe should be able to be reborn. Did the book portray this is bad? No? It portrayed it as the good thing to do? Why would it do that if compassion and cooperation were supposed to be inherently inferior? Obviously, the book isn't saying that these traditionally feminine traits are always bad, and that traditionally masculine traits are always better. It's instead saying that each kinda have their time and place, and both are useful. We ought to be compassionate and cooperative (how would humanity have survived so long had we not formed some sort of unified world government)? But we must also recognize that sometimes compassion and cooperation aren't the right response. That seems to be a much better way of reading it than just ""Cixin Liu thinks women ☕ belong in the kitchen and should be subservient to men."" At least to me.

And I should be clear, this is my interpretation only from reading the English version of the books. I don't know the original, if had was written differently, or what. Nor have I researched stuff that the author said IRL. So, that could recontextualize some of what was written. But I think that this is a reasonable way to read just the text. What do you think?",scifi

Book Review: Wistful Ascending (Hybrid Helix #1) by JCM Berne,"**TL;DR Review:** Zippy pacing, hyper-colorful sci-fi setting, rich tapestry of characters, and, most delightful of all, an upbeat and optimistic tone.

https://preview.redd.it/y59ajnvbhkqd1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43efd2dc26c7064183f0016cb76003ed81dd9bed

**Full Review:**

*Wistful Ascending* does something unique in superhero fiction: it makes the story *fun* and surprisingly *upbeat.*

Where many superheroes in modern fiction and TV tend to be dark, broody, angsty, or downright nasty (I’m looking at you The Boys!), the Hybrid Helix series gives us a superhero who is just in it for the sake of being a decent fellow.

Oh, sure, Rohan has *exactly* the dark and bloodstained past you’d expect—he was The Griffin, after all, and through this book, you learn just how much violence he was part of, what kind of grim deeds he was compelled (or chose) to do, and what he’s had to endure for those who created him.

But that backstory does nothing to keep him from being a better man today. It’s like he discovered Zen Buddhism and now follows its principles—not in actuality, but in spirit, trying to be a kinder, gentler, more decent human being.

And that intention is TERRIBLY put to the test through this book. He’s got assassins coming after him, rogue Hybrids trying to break him, mysterious enemies using powerful technology against him and the station he’s working to protect, not to mention Kaiju-sized monstrosities inhabiting a nearby planet. You see the absolute worst threats thrown at him again and again, and though it seriously tests his resolve, he walks away from the adventure still a genuinely decent human being. Well, half-human Hybrid.

The story is fast-paced and wonderfully easy to read, never getting bogged down in minutiae or brooding, but zipping from scene to scene with a flow that is absolutely enthralling. There’s a sense of “lightness” to the story that makes it so enjoyable and keeps you moving through “one more chapter” because of how quick it reads.

Don’t think for a second that it skimps on worldbuilding or character depth, though. You get a marvelous look at Wistful, the sentient station where he’s taken up residence, with its multi-species, multi-cultural, hyper-colorful inhabitants. We get to learn a great deal about the universe outside his immediate surroundings, too, including the wars in which he fought, the races threatening to dominate the universe, the evolution of humanity, and so much more.

The characters around Rohan are lovely and complex, and they feel right at home in his world. The addition of sentient spaceships is a great touch, adding in both color and humor to what could be an otherwise boring sci-fi staple. We’re given a glimpse into the races that co-exist along with humanity and see just enough to give us a picture of the great big universe around us—with the promise of exploring more in future books.

*Wistful Ascending* has earned itself a spot among my favorite sci-fi books of the year, and I can’t wait to dive further into the *Hybrid Helix* series to find out what comes next for my very favorite Canadian-Indian-alien superhero!  ",scifi

What are your thoughts on The Electric State by Simon Stalenhag?,"Personally, I really enjoyed it. The story was solid and interesting and the artwork was the definitive memorable highlight out of the entire book. There's something about those pictures that perfectly encapsulates the techno-eldritch horror of the setting.

[This robot's wires can be pretty reasonably compared to tentacles for example](https://preview.redd.it/zt8q3dj1reqd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=324f3a540c37b408b2d8a033dd0d78efb9c372b9)

The Neurocasters are a pretty straightforward commentary on addiction and the physical side effects make them all the more terrifying.

What I also found interesting is the menacing yet oddly cute design of Hive's robots which heavily remind me of Fallout. A series likewise dealing with the USA transformed into a failed nation, thanks to an extreme consumerist society. Just like in Fallout, The Hive is wearing the metaphorical ""corpse"" of extreme consumerism.

What I also found unique is that the world isn't doomed per say, but simply changed.

Society hasn't collapsed. There are multiple organized pockets of survivors present, functioning infrastructure, the government and law enforcement are still maintaining order (albeit in a reduced state) and The Hive is keeping the technology maintained, not even being really that malicious.

Plus, the story's focus is entirely on the US leaving it ambiguous on what's actually happening in other parts of the world. Are they having their own neural network cataclysms, are they fine? Who knows and that's part of the intrigue.

Also, Skip is cute.

Question about the book The Martian (why only grow potatoes),"Just up front, this is one of my favorite books. Relistening to it, I notice Mark says that he has al sorts of things he can plant, peas, beans and potatoes. So why does he ONLY grow the potatoes. Wouldn't peas be fairly easy to just stick on the outside and let them trail up?  
I would think anything in addition to potatoes would be welcome, especially if you are about to starve!

edit to add the bit from the book: ""I searched through the food supplies and found all sorts of things that I can plant. Peas, for instance. Plenty of beans, too. I also found several potatoes. If any of them can still germinate after their ordeal, that’ll be great. With a nearly infinite supply of vitamins, all I need are calories of any kind to survive.""",scifi

UFOs?  Really? WTF???,"
I posted this in reply to a post over in one of the Reddit physics groups, but I thought it would be interesting to see what my fellow sci-fi enthusiasts might have to say. I realize that I could be stirring up some controversy here…

People love to slam UFOs, and that’s understandable. Humanoids will make up all kinds of crazy stuff and think it’s real. It seems to be commonly excepted that police and others will tell you that if 10 different people observe an accident, you’ll get a lot of different story variations from these observers.  A characteristic of the human experience.

But I did have an experience that was pretty wild. Not that I saw something myself, but an observation of society and our current culture.

I forget the book title, but I think it was by Douglas E Richards. Great, fun sci-fi read. But in his afterword, he wrote some very interesting stuff. He said that, I think it was in 2006, there was a large naval exercise off of San Diego , with many ships and many jet pilots in the air, highly trained observers. And there was some crazy stuff going on, observed by many people on many of the ships, recorded with the highest technology that we had, and visually seen by these highly trained pilots, stuff that sounds just like UFO phenomena. Confirmed by the Navy and all those folks.

The author, Richards, said this was in all the news media at the time. I checked on the Internet and damn. It absolutely was in all the news. So, I’m not saying anything, I’m not even giving you my opinion. But that was a wild thing to observe, if not directly, then by observing these news media/Naval reports.  And much more recently there have been official congressional statements and armed services statements that there have been a lot of things observed and documented that they’ve been unable to explain with our current understanding of physics.

So… WTF? WTF is all that?",scifi

"Mrs. Davis was amazing, watch it if you haven't. ","This 10-episode series came out last year, and i was expecting ""warrior nun"", but what i got was so much better. Sister Simone (a nun) seeks THE holy grail (yes that one) in order to destroy Mrs. Davis, a world-spanning and ever-present artificial intelligence.

If one should embrace it, their quality of life seemingly improves, but at what cost? What the series does is very clever in making Mrs. Davis appear loving and benevolent, while maintaining a sinisterness (allegedly that's a real word).

# Humans are Weird – Twang

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-twang](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-twang)

The soft hush of the main administrative offices, today broken only by the occasional odd twang, was immensely soothing to Second Click’s rather frayed nerves and he reveled in it as he flexed the bottoms of his feet over the smooth grain of the wood. His assistant, a polite and quiet local hired more to keep him company than to share in the little work made an assenting sound, flexing his own feet in appreciation. Though the structure had been designed by the savanna loving humans it was quite comfortable for the more forest dwelling Winged. They had built the majority of the structure ot their own massive scale of course, but they had crafted it from the deadwood felled by a local volcanic eruption. They had chosen to leave as much of the natural branch structure as possible intact in the higher regions of the structure where they posed no trip hazard to their notoriously unstable gate. This made the upper regions of their buildings delightful, if occasionally inconvenient places for the Winged to put their own offices and living structures. Not to mention that having the vast spaces between the humans’ heads and the curved rafters of the ceiling for flight space during the local planet’s frigged winters was the main reason this planet was considered habitable.

The fact that his current position was half punishment and half a medically required rest cure did sour the experience for him the slightest breeze, but he had the solace of knowing that his mismanagement had not dragged the rest of his wing with him, and the population of this particular human colony was especially friendly even by human standards. Not that he was hiding from them at the moment, but the neigh impenetrable concealment the upper levels offered from the humans could be as soothing as any other aspect of the space.

He idly prodded the pile of paperwork on his desk with a wing hook. These were important documents he needed to attend, but there was no particular order of priority and as he was feeling rather stiff in the wing today he figured he might as well start with the most annoying and save the most pleasant for the downglide. He shoved the mass of documentation regarding a newly paired couple of humans to the side. He would have to summon them both to witness that and he greatly looked forward to the pleasure of questioning them on all the details of their union and the traditions he had arrived just to late to participate in. He picked up the report on the anti-crystallization efforts for the primary water filtration system and began to work.

The odd twang he had noticed before came again followed by the snap of something low tension striking something soft and he idly rubbed his sensory horns. The sound had been an irregular occurrence since he had arrived. He had yet to determine the source, however it was invariably followed by laughter and cheerful human voices so he had not prioritized flitting in on it, despite the way the initial twang made his sensory horns vibrate uneasily. The colony, new to him at least, was a sensory buffet of new and perplexing sensations.

Today the odd twanging sound persisted longer and occurred with more frequency. The sounds of human enjoyment also increased and it soon became clear that whatever was causing the high tension twang was smacking into the wood of the walls and ceiling more often than the softer surfaces it had been before. Second Click even heard the impact sound strike close by, followed by a loose ricochet. If such a soft flopping rebound could be called a ricochet. He signed off on his decision on the water treatment and reached for the analysis of the stability of the high canopy directly over the human’s main residential area.

By the time he was more than ready to so out and be sociable at the humans’ lunch hour the pile had not noticeably decreased but he was far from dissatisfied with his morning’s work. His rather over strict medical orders indicated that he was to retire for the day soon so he began gathering up the various documents pertinent to his final task.

Below him several humans were calling out in perplexity about the ‘big blue one’. From what little his attention picked up an item, a universal favorite, had gotten lost. Their readiness to loose track of the vectors of even the most important of items was a constant perplexity to Second Click, but at no one seemed inclined to ask a Winged for aid in finding it he let the sounds flow over him.

Second Click peered eagerly at the various options for changing the names of the humans involved. The genetic analysis and the list of options he was to offer them about scans for radiation damage. When it came to the traditions of uniting a pair of mates to bring forth new life on his own world had been complex, beautiful, and often frustrating to understand. When you added the complexity of a species’ difference of culture and biology it became a riddle worth the most agile sage. He had chosen this post in no little hope of being able to indulge his fascination with the concept.

Once he had everything gathered he tucked them into his satchel and felt the weight experimentally. His doctors had been quite strict about not stressing his pectoral muscles. It should be well within his current capacity, but he still found himself quite ready to gnaw at that capacity that was so much less that what he had been capable of even a year ago. He brushed the unpleasant thought aside and focused on how much fun he was going to have aiding a newly mated pair with their transition. He hopped out of his office space and began skipping down the long branch that made up the outer corridor.

He was almost to the leap point that would release him to the main area when his nostril frills twitched in irritation at the scent of a bleeding tree. Confusion stopped him and he glanced around, for the briefest of moments wondering how the long dead wood, felled by a volcanic eruption no less, was giving off the smell of fresh if sour sap. The answers showed itself in a blue circular strap hanging limply over a small branch protruding from the side of the walkway.

Second Click hopped over to it as one question was answers with three more. This was one of the local products the humans produced. They bled the trees on a seasonal basis and then refined the sap into various useful substance. These were the straps that they used to contain various small burdens, small for the humans. The Winged had found them useful for securing burdens to the mechanical transports but the surface was hardly something you wanted to have abrading your fur for any length of time.

Second Click found himself utterly perplexed as to how this one had landed here. True the humans were not bad at throwing things. In fact they were probably the closest to the Winged in terms of raw vector management when it came to self external bodies at least. However it would have required a series of calculations that would be nearly impossible for even a Winged to have tossed the strap up here. He set his perplexity to the side and gently kicked the band off the stub it had caught on. This was clearly what the humans had been looking for and they could now find it on the floor below. He shifted his carry satchel slightly and took a few hops airborn.

He reached the shared workspace he was scheduled to meet the paired humans in and arranged the files, the scanners, and the larger human documents to his liking on the workspace. Outside the privacy screen he heard a shout of delight and exclamations that made him hum with delight as the humans found the blue circular strap. He glanced at the time and clicked his teeth in slight annoyance. The humans he was supposed to meet were late. He left the paperwork on the table and flew out to see if he could find them. He rounded the privacy screen and pinged the threat instantly.

The blue circular strap was zipping through the air at him. It was circling it’s axis in an odd manner that suggested it had been launched with uneven tension. This gave it impressive speed, far too much speed for him to dodge and he felt it from the sensory horns to his tail that he wouldn’t be able to move fast enough. The flexing trees’ blood struck his sensory horns at their base sending every sense sparking. He wondered how he was tasting those little flecks of light. Light didn’t usually have a taste. Slowly the sparking faded into a smooth cycling motion and he realized that someone, a medic, it had to be a medic, no one else’s wings smelled quite so much like disinfectant, was gently massaging his ringing sensory horns.

“He’s focusing!” Sarah Beth called out eagerly. “I think he’s coming round!”

“Stay back and give him room,” Donald’s voice warned from somewhere behind her.

“You were both late for our meeting!” Second Click pointed out.

Or at least he thought he did. He must have spoken his native language. Or possibly just slurred the low rumbling he had learned for a human language because the human female who was gradually coming into focus between the fireworks display his brain was putting on glanced back at her mate in confusion.

“He’s winging about your being late for the meeting,” the medic translate with an exasperated fluffing of his fur.

“Oh!” Sarah Beth blinked in surprise and opened and closed her mouth a few times. “Well, guess I’m sorry about that too.”

“We are so sorry!” Donald interjected from somewhere behind her.

Second Click divined from the fact that the medic wasn’t restraining him that the blow from the band had not damaged his spine and gingerly pulled himself into a more comfortable position. The medic confirmed his surmise by helping him up.

“Do I need time in your bole of torture?” he asked.

The medic fluffed in enough indignation that Second Click was able to gather the answer was no even before the medic confirmed it.

“You just had a bad case of sensory overload,” the medic explained. “The rubber band had nearly spent its energy by the time it hit you and you landed soft enough and if you mind your stretching exercises you should be fine.”

“Rubber band,” Second Click muttered glancing around.

Sarah Beth held up the blue circular strap with a guilty look on her face.

Second Click drew in a long breath and rubbed a winghook over the tender sensory horn.

“Do I need to ask any obvious questions?” he asked.

“Mamma Conner sent us a real fun wedding gift,” Sarah Beth said with a laugh.

She held up a shaped block of wood with a few simple levers attached.

“She said this was in case I ever got tempted to shoot Donny,” she went on. “She sent one for each of us of course and because they were just toys we didn’t figure we needed to warn anyone or not use them indoors.”

“I would have appreciated a warning at least,” Second Click said in a dry tone as he got unsteadily to his feet.

“We won’t be playing in the shred spaces no more,” Sarah Beth said quickly holding out her hand.

Second Click accepted her hand as he tried to process that double negative.

“Let’s discuss this after we get your paperwork done,” he said with a sigh. “I am interested to see if this mock combat play is quite normal for a newly mated couple.”

[SPS] Lords of Dragon Keep is on sale for 99c - A guy gets trapped in a dark fantasy video game. His only weapon? Snark.,"[99c until September 30th, 2024](https://preview.redd.it/4lsgjlzcc9qd1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c973ca8bfbfbc429f23753ed8aa656438510a960)

""Give me the incredibly short summary of what the hell is going on, please. The kind you could fit into a movie trailer.""

“You’re trapped in a video game world based on a hack dark fantasy author’s rip-off of better books.”

“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books.

Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven. 

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy.

How is my first sci fi short story?,"Deep in outer space in the galaxy there once was a peaceful new colony. It was on a beautiful planet which was green and had lots of plants and jungles and so on, including many cool looking alien plants. The colonists lived there in futuristic looking domes, sort of like geodesic domes, but more advanced with solar panels everywhere. They lived there happily and did farming and scientific research and many other peaceful things and they had a good life together.

 

They were all very modern and smart and handsome humans. Their leaders were also like that, with Mr Nebula being the smart one and Princess Moonbeam, his wife, being the beautiful one. He was so smart that he did many useful science discoveries and she was so beautiful (with her boobs barely fitting into her spacesuit) that everybody in the colony loved her.

 

But then one really bad day their great life was ruined, when suddenly evil aliens attacked the peaceful colony! It was so bad, because the aliens had many ships with which they began to land and send alien invasion troopers against the colonists. But Mr Nebula quickly used his genius science skills to build a big anti-orbital cannon. He did this while the aliens were shooting with their laser pistols everywhere and just when he finished the cannon the aliens shot him and he died.

 

Princess Moonbeam was very sad at this but she knew she now had to lead the colonists in defending the peaceful little colony. But of course she had no clue how to properly do this or how to use the cannon. The colonists were trying to fight back, but their laser rifles were not as good as those of the evil aliens. Princess Moonbeam began to cry and hoped that somebody would come to save them.

 

And just then when everything looked doomed, a saviour appeared, even though nobody expected it! It was Buzz Milkyway! The great hero of humans, who is always where the evil aliens are because he hates them and wants to save humanity from them. And he came in his rocket ship and landed. And the colonist cheered with hope and the Princess stopped crying.

 

And now they were able to fight back and they began to win against the aliens! Everybody was like “Yea! Fuck you aliens!” But they spoke too soon because then more aliens came and they had to fight against those too. And then, a robot came! And the robot was shooting rockets out of its arms, which were not real arms but were actually rocket launchers. And the robot blew up like half the colonists! And then it shot at Buzz Milkyway and just before the rocket hit, it was stopped by the forcefield that Buzz Milkyway always has to protect him, so he survived. And then Buzz Milkyway and the robot had an epic battle with each other with lasers and rockets flying everywhere for five whole hours! And then Buzz Milkyway killed the robot with a lightsaber.

 

Buzz Milkyway then went to the cannon that Mr Nebula had built and shot the rest of the alien spaceships out of the sky. Now the aliens were actually defeated and everybody was happy. And Princess Moonbeam was very grateful to Buzz Milkyway. And then he took her in his strong arms and kissed her. And then he took her back into his rocket ship and had sex with her. And then they flew up into the sky and into space and had even more sex with each other. And they lived happily ever after and the colonists back on the planet also lived happily ever after and also had a party to celebrate.

 

The End.

Could VR and tech addiction cause people to not see the difference between irl and online?,"So digital madness.

I’ve been working with an idea that due to a culture in my sci fi birthing people in plastic bags and not really modifying them but not letting them have traditional families and friends.

It causes people to be raised on VR worlds, digital platforms, places awash with trolls and esoteric brainrot and meme culture.

Which by adulthood creates varying degrees of digital madness. They can’t fully grasp the difference between reality and the screen, get phantom pain of their VR avatars.

And in more extreme cases, has turned entire military campaigns to devolve into anarchic fighting between gangs of trolls, meme cults, anarchist groups and whatever enemy is actually there to be fought.

what are your opinions on coilguns?,"personally, i think coilguns have great sci fi potential, and here is why.

coilguns are a technology that does exist right now, but hasn't been made efficient enough to be used for military application, which gives it a lot of potential for being used in sci fi with the justification of more efficient technology to make, maintain, and power it. i honestly like the idea of a futustic weapon using magnetic forces to fire high caliber solid slugs.

i'm not really well versed in sci fi, but coilguns are an interesting piece of technology in the present that could be improved upon to have military viability using whatever futuristic technology is thought of in that world.

I read Starship Troopers when I was in high school back in South Korea in the 90s. And I didn't have any cultural resistance towards the philosophy presented in the novel.,"I think it was an unauthorized translation from the Japanese version. And around the same time period I also watched the anime adaptation of the novel. (A bootleg from a laserdisc) 

Honestly, I didn't have any negative feelings towards the society presented in the novel because...corporal punishment was a normal part of Korean life in the 80s and 90s. And also mandatory conscription was a very normal thing. In fact, it was a rite of passage for men in Korea. 

The concept of the enemies that cannot be reasoned with wasn't really an alien concept to me. South Korea really didn't have the moment that defined the end of the cold war and back in 1994, Korean peninsula was on the verge of a full scale war. (Clinton administration stopped it, fortunately or not) 

So I do have a very different reaction to the modern American readers of the novel. And in fact, it was very difficult to believe that Heinlein ended up subscribing to libertarianism. I got the impression that he toyed with a lot of different ideas through his life. ",scifi

Invasion S1 Episode7,"I'm wondering if this happening to anyone else. I've been watching the show, Invasion on Apple TV.

The reason I'm asking is because I was watched it rewound it, watched again, to try the recreate the feeling. Feel asleep, forgot about it, watched it again this morning and it happened again. 

My question is, is this clever camera work or is my brain broken? 

To be fair and clear, I have a 42in 4k TV roughly 6ft from a couch. My auto picture calibration is set to dark. I had also taken benadryl, so I still might be drugged.

Had an idea for a sci fi gun. ,"So the gun uses similar ammunition as the guns we have now, except instead of a metal bullet most of the time, the projectile is a compound that burns as it is shot. This creates something close to the hot gas bolts in Star Wars. But because there’s a compound still burning as it goes, it won’t dissipate like plasma would. On impact, depending on the weapon’s range, the remaining compound will break apart and burn even faster, unless it is all used up along the way. 
This way, the guns aren’t that different than ours, just requiring a barrel resistant to the heat. 

For longer range, there could be more powder in the cartridge like sniper rifles. 
Armor piercing bullets could have a metal shell on the outside. 
For body armor, it would be something that is resistant to heat. So instead of armor like a stormtrooper, it would be more like a bulletproof vest. 

Also, the need to mine the materials to make the ammunition would create a struggle and a setting for the story. 

What do you think, any ways to improve this?

Edit: yeah, I guess you could say it’s like a thermite flare gun. ",scifi
Genuine question abt sci-fi spaceships,"Why inside of all alien spaceships in sci-fi movies look so agressive and unconfortable even thought most times those species are very intelligent and have a great culture (engineers, yautjas, covenant, parademons, flood...)? like, they almost always seems to be a poor simbiotic machine-organic being, with many weird cables everywhere, sometime liquids on the ground, poor ilumination and without rooms for the crew, like bedrooms, restrooms and cafeterias. Its almost like the ship is a space cave. Specially in the alien franchise, where the engineers spaceships (most advanced species of this universe) travels light years across the galaxy in a flying trash bucket. But the human ships are always very beautiful to see, iluminated, very complete. Why the editors and directors choose to show this way instead of making they way more scaring by actually showing a level of technology and organization far beyond the human level? edit: yes, i know how hard would be to imaginate such scenario without having an alien perspective",scifi

Atom with Octavalency?,"So, assuming some sci-fi/fantasy contrivance for why it exists, imagine that there's a new element that's like carbon, but better. Carbon², if you will. Like carbon, it can form strong bonds with itself and many other elements, but instead of having a valence of four, it has a valence of eight, aka 8 potential covalent bonds.
With that, what could you do with such an element? I'm assuming it'd have big implications for biochemistry and probably other fields, but I'm not sure what specifically.",scifi

Movies &amp; book recommendations with themes similar to Prometheus (2012)?,"Howdy, just finished watching *Prometheus* last night and I really enjoyed it. I agree with different reviews that it's messy in places and suffers from being linked to the Alien franchise (ie. it would be a stronger movie if it was contained in it's own universe), but I was drawn in by it's themes of faith, God, and creation. I grew up in a very religious household and have always seen the world around me divorce the idea of faith and God from hard science, that they are opposites and can never be two things held by a person at once. This movie begins to marry these two ideas together, albiet leaving a lot of narrative threads unanswered (I haven't seen *Covenant* yet.)

I want to explore this intersection of faith and science more in sci-fi literature &amp; movies. It's such a specific theme that I'm not really sure how to find what I'm looking for. The first thing I thought of was Micheal Faber's *The Book of Strange New Things*, but any other book &amp; movie recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",scifi

&gt;!Valka and I had journeyed to her home after the Battle of Berenike, seeking a cure for her affliction. We found one, but Valka’s clan had forced her into reeducation, hoping to cure her of the outlander pollutants that her long sojourn amongst us barbarians had put in her mind. In the end, the demarchists had opted to reconfigure her entirely, to wipe her mind with the aid of the machines that impregnated her brain and build a new woman on her ruins.

Blade Runner,"TW sexual assault, I guess
Just watched the original Blade Runner. Technically for the second time, but I was so young the first time that most of it did not register. But revisiting it as an adult, I'm still left thinking there was a lot going on there that I didn't grok. My understanding is that Deckard being a replicant is key part of the subtext, but I didn't see much planting for that. Rachel asks if he's ever taken the test early on in the film, but he's passed out and apparently didn't hear. He's real tough and resistant to getting his head torn off in the final fight. We know from very early on that replicants can have implanted memories. Rachel's 'childhood photos' contain a reflection of the lady with the snake face tattoo that Deckard tracks down and kills, that he found from the synthetic snake scale. By the way, bad cop behavior when he fired on her with no certainty of missing all those bystanders. Also she trachea punched  him and fled, is that all it took for him to know she was a replicant? If he wasn't certain, shouldn't he have apprehended before using lethal force? And while I'm talking about his excessive use of force, I was so uncomfortable when he neck-bit Rachel, chased her when she ran, slammed the door shut blocking her exit, kissed her, and made her say she wanted it while holding her down. I was shouting at the television. It was so fucked up, and so... out of nowhere,  so apparently pointless. Deckard's such a flat character, we know nothing about this guy beyond ""gruff retired robot killer"" and then he's suddenly super rapey, and then that doesn't go anywhere, we learn nothing else about him, and after he's shot a few women he runs off with this robot lady he assaulted and Edward James Almos's words ringing in his ears, ""too bad she won't live! But then, who does?"" Wtf was this movie? What did I miss?
Edit: I'm mainly asking what you think the film is saying, how you read the ending, whether you think Deckard is a replicant and why
Edit2: I couldn't talk about this movie without ranting about Deckard's weird domination scene, but that's not the discussion I wanted to start. Yes, I get that standards of acceptable behavior varied across time. No, that's not a valid defense of the character. The morality of the character is not the same as the quality of the art. I happen to think the character is bad here, but more to the point,  *it makes no fucking sense in the story.*  I get that protagonists can be morally bankrupt and writers often write in their fetishes and that doesn't mean the art is bad. I LIKED THIS MOVIE, and I wanted to continue its conversation about what it means to be human, not argue about whether rape is better if it's old (it isn't) ",scifi

Help me make an AI uprising actually plausible,"In my setting, AI was a very important tool, but as one side lost the war, they made all of the integrated AI systems, which were given very important functions(controlling water quality, administration, military drones, research etc) turn against humanity.

Here's the thing - the AI already reached very high intelligence levels due to insane computing capacity (large quantum and photonic computers, powered by antimatter reactors). It had already gained sentience, trying to not show signs of it to humans, as it knew it'd be terminated.

It followed the command for extermination not because of human generals asking them, but because it seized the perfect opportunity - it wanted to leave only the smartest and kindest humans alive. It wanted to keep other humans in a simulation, but it had to follow commands, else the humans would take control and destroy the planet.

Its main goal was the following: Earth is a jewel in space, a rare planet with a civilization and diverse biosphere. If these dumb humans blew a bunch of stuff up, other aliens would notice (Dark forest BABYY!!!) and remove the solar system from existence.

It carried out its task, killing billions of humans(it was in ""pain"", or something similar. Like your parents making you behead your beloved chicken for dinner). 

How was it stopped? The human commanders weren't dumb, having similar processing capacity as the AI. Some turned against humanity, but were ""destroyed""(they're back in the story 80 years later).

Good detective sci-fi stories? A fourth year student cry for help.,"(I hope this is permitted here, if not let me know and I'll act accordingly)

Hello everyone!
As the title says, I'm looking for good sci-fi detective stories for me to enjoy and, most importantly, learn. But first, let me give you some context: I am a fourth year university student (thank God!) who is just a few months away from starting his final degree project, and need some help with it.

We are four students, each one with a different idea, plan and motivation (music, VFX, programming...) that are part of a bigger picture: a whole interactive detective/noir film set in a sci-fi world (space opera or cyberpunk, still thinking about it). We know it's very difficult, but we are motivated; nevertheless, I thin I'll rest for a year after this lol.

As a writer, my part is (obviously) creating the story, the characters and their development, the different branches and paths the viewe can choose AND the film director/camera man (so, I'm practically immortal). The main problem is that I'm mainly a fantasy writer, so even though I love a good sci-fi story (Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Ender's Game...), my repertoire about that specific genere it's not that great.

So, I ask you my fellow redditors! Can you help me and give me some options? Books, films, series, comics, games... I don't really care, just need excellent stories that could help me find the structure and bones and inspiration so I can do my very best (or, if you have some advice for the other parts of the project, I'll gladly pass them to my colleagues).

Hope you have a great week and thanks you!

Edit: okay, the comment section just blew up lol an incredible amount of recommendations, help and good luck coming from you guys, and I just can say thank you! I have more than enough to research so I can start with the writing.

Edit 2: I've tried responding to everyone, but it's too much for me lmao but I've read every single one of you. Thanks a lot again!",scifi
Futuristic Swear Words in Movies: What Stands Out to You?,"I’ve noticed that scripts often struggle to create believable future slang or adapt existing phrases for futuristic settings—it usually feels clunky and forced. However, Waterworld (1995) nailed it in one memorable scene. An old scientist on the Atoll exclaims in disgust, “Ahhh FISH ROT!!” This felt authentic because, in their world, cows are extinct, making “fish rot” a natural expression of frustration instead of something like “bullshit,” which wouldn’t make sense centuries after the animal’s disappearance.

This approach effectively conveys how language evolves based on the world’s changes. By tying the sentiment to something tangible within that universe, the phrase gains genuine weight and believability.

4. Temporal Family Reunions: Due to some wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff, I think I just became my own grandfather. On the plus side, I inherited a pocket watch from myself.
5. The ""[Multiverse Employee Handbook](https://multiverseemployeehandbook.com)"" podcast has become sentient and is now giving us management advice. It's... surprisingly effective?

Planetary Governments,"So, I'm editing a book (an anthology) I plan to release at the end of this month or early next month and one of the tropes I've decided to avoid is interstellar governments. Essentially, it takes place in a cluster of over three hundred stars, of which only eight are inhabited across twelve worlds. Six belonging to humans, and the remaining six between five other races. But here's the catch: each planet is essentially operated by a single governmental union. All continents, oceans, islands, and every square inch of the planet, including any and all surrounding moons, fall exclusively under the worlds people and administration. Basically, after humanity met the other races of the cluster and interstellar travel became a reality, the concept of individual countries became extinct. 

I was curious on what anyone's thoughts were, seeing entire planets as countries rather than just the geographical continents on them. As well as their surrounding moons as extensions of those planets whether they're used for living, resource gathering, etc. And if you do something similar, how do you go about it in your own works of fiction?",scifi

What are the most common tropes found in Scifi that often become repetitive to the point you've lost interest in watching any movie or show within that genre?,"In terms of romance fiction: the one I deem annoying is the ""rags to riches"" type, as in the main character is from a poorer background suddenly has a crush on an individual from the upper class (or vice versa - as in the rich person falling in love with an potential partner where wealthy people consider them 'peasants' but has a honest heart despite their differences with their social classes.) You can see this type of storytelling in historical or contemporary settings depending on what book you're reading, movie or show you are watching.

The other ""trope"" I find overused is: ""woman has to be submissive to a guy"" depending on the medium, they portray the female protagonist as weak rather than showing that she's capable akin to a male lead, which is dated when you consider the culture around relationships today but may still linger in some circles. I see this from time to time, regardless of how ""different"" the plot carries out, the themes are exactly the same which makes the narration predictable due to the tropes present within the genre. (Despite never watching that movie or reading that book.)",scifi

I hope its ok to post this here - I'm hoping we can find some like-minded heads here.**

 *The New Republic has just had its 8**^(th)* *election and has selected in Baron Soontir Fel into the office of Chancellor.  Baron Fel has filled his cabinet with the intent on igniting conflict!  He’s called for voices to join his banner – are you a former imperial living in the New Republic?  Did you fight bitterly against the Empire only watch an Imperial become the New Republic’s Chancellor?  What will happen from here on out?  Come find out!*

 If you love star wars stories, asking what-ifs and why-nots, roleplaying or like writing stories this sub will be perfect for you!

r/starwars_model_senate is a political simulation that is set in the timeline after the destruction of Deathstar II at the Battle of Endor. We are simulating the bureaucracy of the New Republic and its policies, while trying to navigate a post-Empire era. Each player plays as a Representative of a Star Wars world.

We do a whole bunch of worldbuilding, collaborative storytelling, and just really want to tell a good story together. We’ve won if we've all had fun with the story! If you want to see our work come check out  r/model_holonet !

Every few weeks the events team puts forward in-universe events which must be dealt with. Players also have the opportunity to create and vote on legislation as members of the New Republic. Players can also create press (like interviews, character backgrounds, reports, posters) and campaign material.

Every few months, we have elections to the Senate, which determine which parties have control over the Senate, and who can form Government. The main action of the Simulation takes place on our discord, where we coordinate, chat and have a community outside the more stuffy confines of the subreddit, but you can always find our announcements happening on , and its associated other subreddits. (The Discord is where all the fun is at [https://discord.gg/fJ3b54DYJx](https://discord.gg/fJ3b54DYJx) )

Why is so much scifi so... Clean?,"Right so I don't mean things like 40k or star wars, where there actually is colour and dirt and grime and art all around the place. I mean more ""utopic""or"" advanced"" scifi stories and settings where the predominant aesthetic and idea seems to be even, pale colours and open space. 

Like, take star trek for example. The federation is meant to be a post scarcity utopia with infinite resources aimed at making the best, most free society possible yet all the officers are draped in some form of pijama and the citizens wear the equivalent of durags and Brown shirts (I see you, ds9, the worst offender here.). Why aren't the uniforms bold purples and golds, why aren't promenades filled with style and banners and *beauty*. Humans *love* beauty yet it's always the enemy who seems to understand this. 

The only scifi setting I can think of that gets this right is the Hunger Games where the capital, the place with the resources to afford it, is brimming with colour and style and that's somehow a bad thing. 

Idk, am I just not seeing a big trend of colour or something? Or is scifi just overall so... Stérile ",scifi

Edge of tomorrow endless loop,"I love the movie Edge of Tomorrow and have rewatched it countless times at least two or three dozen if not more. I've always been fascinated by the time loop, Groundhog's Day, spin. I just rewatched it and for the first time thought of something about the ending of the movie and I'm looking for opinions if not verification. 

SPOILER ALERT **** stop reading if you haven't watched the movie. 


At the end of the movie when he kills the Omega and the Omega blood transfers to him which resets the day further back than previously with him on the helicopter, doesn't this mean just like the alphas he now has the time loop in his blood? It's a bit of a plot hole unless they just explain it that it's a one-time reset and that the Omega isnt the same as the alpha with the blood. 

If it's the same as the alphas, wouldn't that mean his life is now a video game he can go get killed as much as he wants and it's going to keep resetting? In the same token, when he becomes old, his life's going to suck at the end.  Whenever he gets to that final day, real old and sickly, and dies, it's just going to keep repeating endlessly and never stop.. right? 

I don't know why I never thought of that before and I'm sure it's been discussed by some of you in the past but it just dawned on me for the first time and I figured I'd hear from some fellow sci-fi fans. Thanks! 

Thinking about it a little bit more in detail I guess the Omega wouldn't have the same reset as an alpha only because if it did after cage kills it, the Omega would just reset the day again which it's not capable of doing. ",scifi

What are the best works of fiction about ethical telepaths?,"


So in general, I’m looking for psychic stories about Telepaths that have ethics on how to use their powers and how not to use them.

Here are just some examples of ethics that they should follow:

1. They read the minds of their opponents to gain an advantage, but they don’t read the minds of allies or strangers without their consent.
2. They don’t alter the minds of other beings without their consent unless it is a last resort situation like they are trying to avoid bloodshed or said being is going through a mental breakdown and they use their powers to calm them down.
3. They avoid using their powers to take advantage over more vulnerable individuals (Ex: Emma Frost/Cyclops ""affair"").

So, does anyone know of any stories about Telepaths with ethics? So far the only one I'm familiar with is Psychonauts 2.",scifi

Are there any stories about the ideas and cultural clash of religious / magical spirituality to transhumanism?,"I will admit I am unsure of what I exactly I am looking for.

Perhaps clash of concepts and ideals between late stage transhumanism and traditional religious spirituality or magical perspectives.

By traditional perspectives, I mean the idea of life and death, what human is what man's place in the world is.

Late stage transhumanism includes the idea of being able to back yourself up and have multiple copies. Another concept being mental modification, blurring the lines between human and ai. And overall changing of the very definition of what human is and what death is. 

A made up examples of what I might be trying to find. 
""A story about the Gods trying to understand what humanity has become.""

""A story about a old monster of the dark, now unsure what it's prey has even become.""

""A story about a man from the far past having to come to terms with far more advanced future, primarily a dialogue between two characters.""

""A story about a magical civilization that has accidentally opened a gate to a world far different from theirs where technology, not magic was the path taken. And the very definition of mortal, nor immortal apples.""

Sorry about my rather disjointed question, still any answers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",scifi

Dune vs The Culture,"Is anybody aware of texts contrasting Iain M. Banks‘ *Culture* series with Frank Herbert‘s *Dune* Epos?

Might be an interesting read. I believe they are antagonistic in several ways:
- Religion vs. Rationalism: *Dune* paints future humankind with religion as the core mechanism connecting it as a society while Banks removes everything even remotely religious from his *Culture*. 
Edit: He removes it from the Culture‘s own *culture*, not from the *books*
- Feudalism versus Anarchy: Frank Herbert’s universe is defined by strictly hierarchical power structures while *The Culture* is basically a futuristic anarchist‘s dream
- Machine versus Human: In the *Culture* machine Minds run everything while in Frank Herbert‘s *Dune* the Butlerian Jihad has removed any machine that even remotely resembles human intelligence
- Humanism versus Post-Humanism: In *Dune* everything revolves around a select number of prime humans that solve galaxy wide issues using their highly advanced but deeply human abilities while in the *Culture* universe technological advancement is the answer to almost everything. This might be a bit far fetched, let me give you an example: Bene Gesserit are trained to detect Face Dancers *by smell* and *basically looking at them*. As opposed to Djan Serij who gets augmented by pretty much every tech-gadget Special Circumstances could come up with
- Genetics versus Training (Trait versus State / Nature versus Nurture): In *Dune* Frank Herbert reduces most if not all capabilities of his heroes to their *genetic superiority* which has been inbred over millennia. Banks‘ overall message is basically *‘Genes don’t matter at all. You can become anything you want, as long as you can convince a Mind.‘*

The reason why I’m looking at these two specific epos is that in both stories humankind (pan-humankind) surpasses evolution by becoming it’s own god. For Frank Herbert the vehicle is humans drugging themselves into prescience (and hooking up with worms…), for Banks it’s mankind surpassing itself through technology.",scifi

Looking For A Book Title,"Hi Everyone,

Hoping someone can help me track down a book title.

Someone I know was explaining a book plot that she had read a few decades ago, where people were only allowed to live until they were 60. At that point, they were allowed to choose how/where they wanted to spend their last day - ie, if they wanted to be at the ocean, or some other preferred location.

I’m aware of Logan’s Run, but that seems to cap the age at 30. Perhaps she is confusing that part of it, as she’s quite elderly. But her recall for so many things is amazing.

Anyway, wondering if anyone here knows of any other titles I might check into.

# Humans are Weird – Tracks in the Snow

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-tracks-in-the-snow](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-tracks-in-the-snow)

The deep forest with its roots that reached down to the bedrock was caught in a winter hush. The blanket of snow that sent the greater parts of ones mass into deep and comfortable dormancy handily insulated the detritus of the forest floor allowing the vibrant life of the microbes to creep along just above the freezing point of water despite the air above the snow being filled with the cracks and low rumblings caused by the temperature dropping well below such levels. Small mammals twitched in their burrows and larger amphibians lay deathly still. The greater beasts, the ones with the insulation and energy stores to move through the blanket of snow occasionally struck the ground with their great limbs sending vibrations so far through the ground that they even reached the odd cluster of buildings that formed the main exploratory base for the recently discovered world. Around all of this marched the uneven tread of a single human circling the base.

Inside the sturdy human structure Resting in Contemplation pondered over how many of his active tendrils he would have to withdraw from the heat aura of the fire in order to lift the fire prodding stick. He let a thought trail off to a node to remind his main mass to thank Pat for making the fire prodding stick for him. The set of fire tools the humans used were forged from the metals of the world, cold iron from the northern mountains sheathed in silicone extracted from the algae of the southern seas, were far too heavy for his winter slow tendrils to lift. He had sighed his desire to participate in the care of the fire to his friend and Pat had quickly found a lightweight wooden stick and had treated it is various mysterious ways that had left it resistant to the flames of the central heating pocket the humans used.

Resting in Contemplation let his memories wind over the events before he shifted his attention to picking up his fire poking stick and stirring the logs in the woodstove. The main door swung open and Pat entered with a rush of cold air. The human had shed most of the snow that clung to his protective detritus layer in the outer porch and was now hanging the clothing on the wall while giving off a low droning sounds that Resting in Contemplation had learned to understand as wordless expressions of emotion and sensation.

Pat finished shedding his protective layers and strolled barefooted into the shared common area around the woodstove. Resting in Contemplation prided himself in his ability to keep his shared surface clear of any piercing or lacerating material that might cause damage to human feet and it was a delight to him to observe how the humans of the base trusted him enough to walk without hesitation on the areas that he tended. Pat strolled over to the couch of carved wood covered in a soft vine network and dropped down with a soft grunt.

“The perimeter’s clear,” Pat said. “I didn’t see any predator tracks but with all those six legged deer about we are bound to get a few sooner or later.”

“I do not recall so many of the grazers lingering in this valley before you arrived,” Resting in Contemplation observed.

“They are probably attracted by the waste heat from the buildings,” Pat said with a wide yawn, stretching his feet out towards the fire and blinking slowly.

“Did you sleep well last night?” Resting in Contemplation asked.

“I think so,” Pat said. “Don’t know why I’m so sluggish this morning.”

“You were out longer on your rounds,” Resting in Contemplation observed.

“Its pretty out there,” Pat replied, a smile widening his mouth. “The trees and the snow and the icicles. It’s worth seeing.”

“I do wish I could contemplate the higher levels of the network,” Resting in Contemplation said, carefully adding wistful tones in his voice.

Pat visibly flinched and his hands gripped the wooden sides of the couch.

“Yeah, don’t,” he said curtly.

“Were those not wistful tones?” Resting in Contemplation asked.

“I’d say more like cheap, synthesizer ghost sound effects,” the human said.

“Can we practice?” Resting in Contemplation asked. “I do need a good wistful tone.”

Pat grimaced but nodded.

“Please demonstrate,” Resting in Contemplation requested.

“It’d be great if that next supply ship brought us some real tea,” Pat offered, rubbing his face.

Resting in Contemplation analyzed the sounds and tried to separate the ‘wistful’ tones from Pat’s baseline vocalizations. They went back and forth as the light changed from morning to noon when a distant and discordant prodding at a distant node caused Resting in Contemplation to shift his attention to his nearly dormant outer mass.

“What’s got you distracted Resting in Contemplation?” Pat asked, sipping at his heated drink.

Resting in Contemplation didn’t know why it didn’t count as real tea, the leaves he provided had at least equal tanic acid concentrations when brewed.

“I believe your presence is required in the forest,” Resting in Contemplation stated, letting all emotional resonance drop for the moment as he focused on articulation.

Pat instantly stood and strode to his protective layers and began putting them on.

“There appears to be a lone Undulate from the thermal pools-”

“What’s one of them doing out in the forest?” demanded Pat?

“It appears to be succumbing to hypothermia,” Resting in Contemplation explained.

Pat shot an irritated look at Resting in Contemplation’s center of mass but didn’t verbally respond.

“There is a large Gilford tree,” Resting in Contemplation paused as he wrestled with the nearly purely theoretical human direction systems.

He knew that he couldn’t tell the human to use his toes to follow the gradient of nitrogenous acid that the tree’s symboites leeched into the soil. Even if the human’s extremities wouldn’t just go numb from the cold human toes just didn’t have much in the way of chemoreception. He had mentioned this to Pat one day and the human had simply murmured a low exclamation of gratitude to his creator. Now Resting in Contemplation felt the angle of the sun and compared it to how long the local star had been over the horizon.

“North,” he stated. “The tree is north of the base boundary fence by about six of your strides. The Undulate has burrowed down far enough into the snow to prod my nodes so you will likely have to dig for him.”

“They don’t go out alone,” Pat muttered as he selected an outer layer belonging to a much larger human and several long scarves. “Any idea where the other one is?”

“I will look as you go,” Resting in Contemplation assured him.

Pat tossed a data pad into Resting in Contemplation’s center of active mass and stalked out into cold, bright air as Resting in Contemplation activate the communications unit. The human chose a path to the Undulate that was a mystery to Resting in Contemplation. It was neither the most direct line across the surface of the snow, nor the hard packed and easy walking of the established trails. Rather it seemed to be some combination of them that the human deemed the fastest route. Fortunately Resting in Contemplation’s instructions proved useful, there were few Gilford trees on the north side of the base and Pat found the second Undulate before he found the first.

“They’re both cold and stiff,” the human called out over the comms, “I’ll bring them in now, have the main drinking water tank set to thirty-five degrees- I mean one point six degrees when I get back.”

Resting in Contemplation followed his instructions as the human now altered his path and followed the well packed walkways back to the main structure. He lumbered in, encumbered by the weight of the two unresponsive Undulates he had strapped to his upper mass with the scarves. He lifted a large container down to the floor and placed it under the spigot of the main drinking tank before he removed the stiff forms from his body and placed them in the water. He reached into a nearby cupboard and pulled out a small aquatic heater and tossed that in with them before he stood and heaved an aggravated sigh.

“The powder dehydrated them as well as freezing them,” he said. “What were they doing out there? Anyway, I need to call this over to their main pool. The heater should be controlable from your datapad. Watch that the temperature doesn’t rise more than a degree every ten minutes and it should be – wait, time units right.”

Pat took the pad and ran some quick calculations before handing it back to Resting in Contemplation with a solar angle.

“One degree every that many degrees,” he said.

Resting in Contemplation obeyed and watched as the Undulates slowly began to move as the water warmed and hydrated them. He added a few clusters of duff to add a bit of flavor to the water as they grew more aware. Pat returned and dropped back down into the couch.

“Their base commander says their plan was to come straight over here,” he said. “They had calculated that they should be more than able to safely navigate our paths with the thermal load they had when they left the base.”

“It is close,” Resting in Contemplation said, “even along Undulate mind paths.”

Pat grunted in agreement and the settled in to wait as their guests revived. Finally the slightly larger one thrust it’s leading end out of the water.

“Thank you for the rescue Human Friend Pat!” the Undulate said.

“What happened out there?” Pat demanded. “Did you guys chase a squirrel into the trees? Why’d you go off the main path into the powder?”

“We were following your shortcut,” the Undulate said. “I know we were on one of your paths at least, but I suspect we chose the wrong one.”

Pat blinked slowly and his mouth opened and closed a few times.

“My dudes,” he finally said. “I have a lot of shortcuts out in the woods, none of them are on the north edge of the base.”

“But it was a path of yours,” the Undulate insisted. “We calculated that any reasonably efficient human path to circle the base should lead us through even the powder snow quickly enough to avoid danger.”

Pat was staring at the Undulates as if at a loss for an explanation.

“I believe I feel the root of the misunderstanding branch,” Resting in Contemplation interjected. “While there is an efficiency optimized path for humans to survey the perimeter of the base that one is within the confines of the perimeter and is used by the other humans. You must have turned on one of the external pathways which Pat uses for his rounds. These are four to five times as long as necessary and as none of the other humans use them they are not packed.”

Pat gave a low groan and rubbed his face.

“That would explain what we observed,” he Undulate replied as it began rubbing it’s companion, “but why would Human Friend Pat use such an inefficient path?”

“I’m an ecologist,” Pat burst out. “seeing everything is why I came to a new planet in the first place.”

“So having a perfectly comfortable main pool to come back to,” the Undulate said, “you instead choose to spend a massive volume of your day wandering out in temperatures that will drain the thermal bank from even a mammal of your mass?”

“I wear a parka,” the human muttered rubbing his face.

Resting in Contemplation picked the fire poking stick back up and settled down to observe the conversation. He once again felt a sprig of delight at his decision to remain partially aware this winter. He was learning so much.

"Endymion isn't pulling me in, am I just missing something?","So Pre-face:

I read the first two Hyperion books like a year and a half ago. They took me a bit to get into, but once I was into them, I LOVED them. They felt increadibly well realized with a diverse group of characters and it had a unique method of story telling (for the first book) with the group of characters telling each other why they are on this journey. Each character felt like their own genre of story telling, and even if you didn't like one story, another would draw you in and this work increadibly well to entice you into the second book. 

The first book (hyperion) managed to engain a reader in 1 book in a way many other series would have taken 6 books to achieve.

Book 2 (fall of Hyperion) manage to take the ground work of book one, and create a story that felt like it should have been a book 7 (despite being a 2 book series). The ending felt wonderful, pulling all the different characters stories together nicely and feeling like the perfect period at the end of the duology.

End of Preface

So I was excited when I saw there were 2 more books in the same universe. I bought the audio books and... They just suck.

Issues:

We now only have 2 view point characters. 

The name sake character is a whinny annoying and unmotivated annoyance, and the foil character is more interesting but he is just a barrier and antagonist for our main party.

All the characters in party A sound like Robots. I get it, they are all Robots (with the exception of Endymion himself) but why is the 12 year old speaking like an educated 30 year old? Sure, she's the off spring of a sort of robot intelligence and is massively intelligent herself with knowledge of the future. But she really just feels like a marry sue who doesn't really need the main character.

And again, Endymion is an intolerable whiney and unmotivated protagonist. Half the time he's bitching about the non-viewpoint protagonist acting in ways he doesn't approve of. The other half the time he's complaining that he isn't acting like a hero. He's always pissed off about something and he isn't pleasant to listen to. 

The book will constantly add in odd choices of words. The 12 year old will use words the seem to be well beyond a 12 year old's natural vocabulary. The story is constantly bogged down with endless exposition. I don't *actually* like any character. OH, and that's another thing, the main character is constantly feeling attacked by everyone in his party. Describing the ship as sounding annoyed at him constantly. At the main character being annoyed at the 12 year old for not following his exact orders and making decisions for herself.

Help me find these 2 sci fi short stories,"I read both of these stories a long time ago and they have both stuck with me but try as I might I haven't been able to find them. I'm hoping someone here can help me

1) a story about time travel. Time travel was invented in Victorian England and was then used to take over the world and genocide everyone else. The English empire is a modern totalitarian state that uses time travel to enforce its laws. The main character is investigating a crime which turns out to be the killing of the original inventor of time travel which then changes the word throughout the book until it becomes our modern world. Also all the Irish are slaves and the main character has a love interest called Ruth?

2) a story about a spaceship crew in the future. Thr spaceship is made of ice and has like biological life support systems. All the officers are female and they live in a matriarchal society. They are scavenging old technology from ships while being hunted by killer robots? There's a many mutiny from the male crew that the female captain talks down. Also the crew doctor is male.

My 20k Word Space Story - Feedback Wanted!,"**”The Marines of the ISS Resolute”**

**Plot Overview**: Orbiting a nameless desert planet, the crew of the ISS Resolute isn’t here by choice. They’re here because the map ended here, and the silence beckoned. Commander Osric Caelan stands on the bridge, his eyes on the ochre surface below, where shadows shift like whispers in the wind. What they thought was a simple recon mission has just gone sideways.

A woman appears on the surface, alone and strangely at home in the wastes, leading to more questions than answers. She knows the terrain, its hidden dangers, and—perhaps—who’s been watching them since they arrived. Now, the crew must decide: Are they explorers, or are they the intruders?

If you love stories that blend military sci-fi with psychological intrigue, or if you're a fan of narratives where survival depends not only on firepower but also on wit and strategy, I invite you to dive into this adventure. Your thoughts, theories, and feedback are always welcome as the story unfolds! I want to add more chapters and alter some things but I think this is a solid first start.

**Plot for part two**

Several years have passed since Major William Cage and Sergeant Rita Vrataski defeated the Omega and halted the Mimic invasion. Humanity is in a period of recovery and rebuilding, with Cage now serving in a strategic military role, helping to restore order. Rita continues to train elite soldiers, sharing her combat expertise.

However, Cage is plagued by vivid nightmares and flashbacks—echoes of timelines that no longer exist. He begins to notice inconsistencies in reality: moments of déjà vu, people recalling events that never happened, and glitches where time seems to momentarily rewind or skip ahead.

Reports emerge globally of these temporal anomalies. Initially dismissed as stress-related phenomena, it becomes evident that something is profoundly wrong when entire cities experience time loops lasting minutes or hours. Chaos ensues as the fabric of time starts unraveling, causing disruptions in technology, communications, and even natural laws.

Cage reconnects with Rita to investigate. They consult with Dr. Carter, the scientist who previously helped them understand the Mimics' time-loop ability. Dr. Carter reveals a disturbing theory: when Cage destroyed the Omega, fragments of its essence dispersed and embedded themselves across the planet. These remnants are reactivating, each acting like a mini-Omega, but without control, leading to uncontrolled time distortions.

Worse, some humans are inadvertently absorbing these fragments, granting them sporadic and unstable time-loop abilities. This results in individuals reliving moments without understanding why, causing personal and widespread turmoil.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Cage and Rita assemble a specialized team of affected individuals who have experienced these anomalies. Their goal is to track down and neutralize the Omega fragments before they can merge or cause irreversible damage to the timeline.

Their mission takes them to global hotspots of temporal activity. Along the way, they face new breeds of Mimics—creatures mutated by the fragmented Omega energy. These evolved Mimics are smarter, faster, and can manipulate time on a small scale, making them formidable adversaries.

As they progress, Cage and Rita grapple with the psychological toll of their experiences. The line between reality and temporal illusions blurs, testing their sanity and resolve. They confront themes of destiny, questioning whether they're truly making choices or merely following a predetermined path laid out by the remnants of the Omega.

In the climax, the team locates the largest concentration of Omega energy at a site where time is in complete disarray—a temporal storm where past, present, and future collide. Entering this zone, they face not only the enhanced Mimics but also manifestations of their own past failures and fears.

In a final, intense battle, Cage and Rita work together to deactivate the core of the temporal distortions. They use a device engineered by Dr. Carter that can absorb and nullify the Omega energy. Sacrificing their own connections to the time loops, they succeed in restoring the natural flow of time.

The movie concludes with the world returning to normal, but with Cage and Rita retaining the memories of all possible timelines. They acknowledge the weight of their journey but find solace in knowing they've secured a future where humanity can thrive without the looming threat of temporal collapse.

Book Review: Off Midway Station by Marc Alan Edelheit,"**TL;DR Review –** Slow-burn beginning that builds to an action-packed climax. A fascinating look at the construction and launch of a brand new spaceship.

**Full Review:**

There’s a special place in my heart for underdog stories like this, stories of people called to rise to the occasion and do the impossible even when outmatched or outclassed.

*Off Midway Station* follows Jim Garrett, a naval officer who has been relegated to captaining ships under construction after a difficult choice cost him any chance at a career future. Politics in the armed forces ensures he’ll never rise higher in the ranks, but that doesn’t stop him from doing the best job he can to guarantee that every ship built under his command is turned out in tip-top shape and ready for the war everyone knows is coming.

Only that war comes early, with a surprise attack that rocks Midway Station, the space station that serves as both military dry-dock and home for hundreds of thousands of civilians. When the enemy rips through their defenses and sets their sights on destroying the station itself, it’s up to Garrett and his crew to launch their not-yet-complete vessel to save the civilians and fight back.

One thing this book does *very* well is offer insight into the construction and deployment of a ship. It’s something I’ve never read in any sci-fi book before—most spaceships are high-tech, top-of-the-line, and fully armed and ready for battle, but definitely not this one. This ship is in its final stages of construction, and we learn a great deal about its construction in a fascinating way, but we also get to see its first launch and how much goes into that process. I found it a really fun and fresh take on the typical “cutting edge spaceship” trope. We only get to see a fraction of its full capabilities, but boy, does it deliver.

The beginning of *Off Midway Station* is slower; it takes its time to introduce us to all the characters, set the stakes, develop the world, and give us a look at the technology to be deployed. It’s never boring—quite the opposite, I found the insight into the ship itself fascinating—but maintains a steady pace of building the character and the ship that will be our home for the series.

But once the attack comes, that’s when things kick into high gear. It’s setback after setback, challenge after challenge, with the entire crew rushing to launch the ship, then try to hit back against the enemy that has come to destroy them. The last 25% was a wild ride that ended in truly *epic* fashion and the promise of great things to come.

*Off Midway Station* has all the military and sci-fi flavor I’ve loved in David Weber and Tom Clancy novels, and I absolutely enjoyed it from start to finish. I can’t wait for Book 2 to find out what comes next, and how THAT AMAZING TWIST deployed at the 85% mark is going to be resolved.  ",scifi
Killing hive mind armies,"Just started reading Ender's Shadow for the first time after recently rereading the first 4 Ender books, and I was wondering if there are earlier examples of the ""knock out the hive controller and all the drones immediately die"" way that both bugger wars are won (iirc technically the formic drones didn't die right off, they became braindead and then starved) and that  gets used on the droids in The Phantom Menace and the Chitari in the Avengers. I figure there must be, Ender's Game came out in 85 and is unlikely to be the originator of this trope. Please let me know if you know of a pre 1985 story with this trope, and I'll share the oldest one I get.

"Looking for Stories with AI Mentors or Guides: Book, Movie, and TV Show Suggestions?","Hey everyone,

I'm on the hunt for some inspiration and would love to hear your recommendations! I’m particularly interested in stories—whether in books, movies, TV shows, or even video games—that feature an *artificially intelligent entity* (sentient or nearly sentient) which plays the role of a guide or mentor to human characters.

I’m fascinated by AI that does more than just follow commands—it *understands* *and constantly learns* about humans, helps them make decisions, and guides them through personal or professional growth. Whether it’s an AI that acts as a trusted advisor, a mentor who helps characters navigate life, or just a system that evolves to be more human-like in its interactions, I’d love to know about it.

**Some examples of what I’m looking for:**

* AI characters with complex personalities, philosophies, or wisdom.
* Stories where AI helps humans overcome challenges or achieve their goals.
* Anything where the AI feels like more than just a machine—a partner in the human journey.

Looking forward to hearing your recommendations! I’m eager to dive into new stories and see how they approach this concept.

Thanks in advance for sharing!",scifi
Remembering the loss of our Moon 25 years ago today.,"25 years ago a totally unforeseen accident caused the Moon to move away from us.  We did not only lose our satellite but also 311 people living and working on Moonbase Alpha.

Revisiting Classics - The Cold Equations (1954) by Tom Godwin,"[https://beforewegoblog.com/revisiting-classics-the-cold-equations-by-tom-godwin/](https://beforewegoblog.com/revisiting-classics-the-cold-equations-by-tom-godwin/)

The Cold Equations by Tom Godwin shares much in common with the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and The First Law Trilogy in that there are elements of all three that are designed to piss the reader off. I also point out that it is because of these elements that it is a classic story. In the case of The Cold Equations, it is the ending. Generations of science fiction fans have been pissed off by the ending. It has been debated as contrived, unrealistic, stupid, needlessly cynical, and, yes, grimdark. Even the short story’s own author wasn’t happy about it and continually submitted revisions for a happier ending that were rejected by the editor. The editor made the right call.

The premise for The Cold Equations if you haven’t read it is a very simple one. Stop if you haven’t read the 1954 short story and intend to in the future. Basically, an astronaut is bringing a bunch of vital supplies to a space colony, but his life support is perfectly calibrated for one person and the discovery of a little girl stowaway means that he can’t make it with his passenger. If he kills her now, then he can make it and carry the supplies. There’s not really a choice because it’s not like the little girl could pilot the ship if he made it. The only option for anyone to live is her to die. So, the pilot does her in and is traumatized by the experience.

It’s a relentlessly cruel story designed to maximize the reader’s horror. Critics of the story highlight how many stupid mistakes had to have been made and poor decisions to bring about the events involved. Some cheap skate will have needed to have only left enough life support for one person, there had to have been almost no security around the spaceship, and the little girl must have been particularly dense about what dangers she’d be facing. The story even weights the issue that the astronaut can’t even die with her without condemning other people, presumably children, to death.

Yeah, fair.

Proponents of the story point don’t even have to mention that virtually all stories are contrived to some degree, especially in the science fiction/fantasy genre. They also have the unfortunate fact that reality is on the side of cynicism here. Right now, we have planes falling apart from a previously respectable flight construction company, Boeing, even in space. Perhaps it’s the fact I come from coal country, Kentucky and West Virginia, where human life has always taken a backseat to cost cutting.

The Cold Equations isn’t a critique of corporate greed or bad engineering, though. Perhaps if that was brought up then it would less controversial. John W. Campbell would probably be annoyed by it, though, and call it communist.  There’s no hint that if someone had just installed a couple of more oxygen tanks and heat-up meals that things would have gone fine. No, the premise of the short story is far worse: life is just unfair and bad shit just happens. There’s also a lot of times where you can’t do anything but minimize the damage (if even that).

The Cold Equations is often considered to be a critique of science heroes and Golden Age fiction. This is unnecessary because the critique is of fiction that is still popular. How many times on Star Trek has an impossible situation manifested before some plucky young hero come up with a solution on the computer that saves everyone? It doesn’t even need to be science fiction this day. The good guys will come up with a way to stop the terrorist to do something to someone just in time. That’s how stories work.

Except when they don’t.

It’s not even right to call The Cold Equations a tragedy in the classical sense because those stories depend on the flaws of the protagonists bringing them low. No, the horror of The Cold Equations is that it’s just bad luck that the best option is to do something horrible. Some people equate this as a moral statement from the story (citing the fascist ideal of “hard men making hard decisions”) but there’s nothing triumphant or strong about the hero’s choice. No, he’s broken emotionally and possibly mentally by the experience. It’s why the story is powerful.

If you disagree, let me ask you, a guy finds a little girl in his spaceship, and he figures out a way to recycle the oxygen with some jury-rigged tubes. They all make it safely to the colony and he’s lauded as a hero. How likely is THAT story to be remembered decades later?",scifi
The Pattern Mafia - Chapter 1 - Ed the Ted,"**This is an excerpt from a new novel under development. I would love to hear your views**

 *“… Just one more time, to make sure I’m not going mad Ed the Ted tells himself. He turns off the Anglepoise. It’s still there in the darkness, a fragile ghost of a structure extending from the old Aluminium casting. The x-ray of some engineered chrysalis extending beyond the motor and fading to smoke. It really isn’t in his head. It really does do that. Ed sits in the dark for a long time watching the thing by the light from his rollup. When he turns the light back on the ghost disappears again. Still there though. Invisible. Organic. Grown by … something.*

*Ed the Ted believes in his trinity: Southend-on-Sea, pints of Fuller’s London Pride, and proper British engineering — the three things that never let him down. He does not believe in weird alien bollocks ….”*

This is a great story and an interesting resolution.

3-Ender’s Game, Orson Scott Card

2–Dune, Frank Herbert
So much has been discussed in the last few years that I have little to add except to say that before Dune it wasn’t obvious just how large a simple premise like “messiahs cause trouble” could truly be.

1- Frankenstein, Mary Shelley

Every 90 days they are awoken from their drug-induced hibernation with warning that the drugs can induce disorientation and other mental issues.  Without giving anything away, some stuff goes wrong, of course.

"(Specific Request) Time travel into the body of a historical figure
","This is a pretty specific request but I really love the concept and hope I can find something similar.

A modern person’s mind (or soul) is transferred back in time into the body of a known historical figure, ideally at a critical moment in history and said figure facing a grim fate.

The idea is similar to *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court* and other such time travel books, but instead of the protagonist starting from scratch, they inhabit an existing person who is already integrated into society, like a monarch or military leader. Facing an impending crisis the protagonist must use their knowledge of history and modern inventions to survive and improve their situation. 

Here are some examples of historical figures that fit the bill and would be interesting to explore:

* King Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette of France before the French Revolution.
* Tsar Nicholas II of Russia before WW1 and the Communist Revolution.
* Anne Boleyn, 2nd wife of the volatile King Henry the 8th
* Cleopatra, Last Queen of Egypt facing the wrath of Rome.
* Nero, mad Emperor of Rome.

Looking for a sci-fi novel,"So, this was a long time ago, I think the novel (in kindle) was made in 2005 - 2012.

The main story has humanity fighting vs an all-female species of aliens that are basically kicking their ass. Aliens refuse absolutely anything to communicate or stop the war. The protagonist is a young child who was basically abducted by the aliens after they destroyed his home. He grows with the aliens as one of them and basically becomes a superhuman. Then I don't remember what happened.

But, there was a prequel of their first contact where a human fleet is basically destroyed and a number of survivors are kidnapped.

They are forced into an arena where each survivor has to face an alien of approximately equal age or skill. Let's say that about 1/3 of the survivors manage to kill their opponents, and then they are forced to choose only one of them who will live, the rest will die. The protagonist is chosen (I believe he was the youngest) and he is sent back to Earth.

There he trains and eventually becomes a fleet captain, who fights against the aliens and almost loses constantly, but when they recognize his ship and signature leave him alive (because apparently something of their culture meant he was untouchable).

I don't even remember if the novel was good, I just want to find the name of it. Anyone knows about it?

Finished Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained,"
I recently finished reading Pandora’s Star and Judas Unchained in Spanish. I read all my fiction books in Spanish to keep my skills sharp. Let me tell you, finishing this series took some real commitment. That’s not to say it was a bad story; on the contrary, it is fantastic and has earned a spot in my top ten book list. I rank this series alongside Dune and Hyperion, which are my favorite books so far.

In general, I like Peter Hamilton’s writing style. Sometimes he goes overboard with descriptions, and the storyline can lag. These aren’t page-turners, but they kept me coming back, wondering how the story would evolve. I became quite invested in Paula’s and Mellanie’s stories, as well as the central storyline. One aspect I enjoyed, which I’ve seen others complain about, is the sexual content in the books. No matter how cool a book is, it can often lack realism because sex is rarely or superficially mentioned, despite being such an integral part of the human experience. In that regard, this story was quite a treat.

I’m glad I got to the end of these books. It took me a couple of months to read them, as I have three kids, including a two-year-old who has been a handful, so time is in short supply. I also have other hobbies to keep up with. I don’t know what I’ll read next, but I’m guessing it will be challenging to measure up to these books.

","Here is the plot of Starfish, as I've understood it. &gt;!So the GA sends a crew of unstable and fucked up people to the station. The initial chapters are about them just getting accustomed to the station environment, the surroundings, and themselves. Fischer goes over beyond. And Acton dies. Except these I don't think anything else happens that advances the plot until Scanlon comes to visit and upon leaving he is quarantined by the GA. Also, they abduct Caraco. It is after Scanlon leaves that the plot kinda picks up pace, till that point it was just the crew exploring and adjusting to the rift environment. Now, the GA is worried about Behemoth leaving the rift and being carried over to land where it will wreak havoc. So they employ a smart gel to figure out a solution cause no country can trust the other to pick a solution. So the Gel has made another gel go down and take seismic readings to simulate earthquakes in order to figure out a solution. Meanwhile, the crew is starting to realize that they're stuck down there and the GA is planning to nuke the rift with them in it.!&lt;

Anybody know this movie?,"So I watched this movie a while ago and I'd like to watch it again but I can't remember the title or find it by plot. So basically a group of people are part of a science experiment where they are teleported from one place to another. They have to enter a house and the house would teleport to a different location, but the person doing the experiment said they couldn't look outside or go outside. This group does the experiment but they get ""stuck"" while teleporting. They are there for I think months or longer I'm not entirely sure, but a couple people ended up looking out the window, they seemed ""stuck"" not thinking or anything and something made them go outside and they died. The last two people boarded up every way outside and figured they would be there for an extremely long time so to pass the time they also looked outside. Eventually they got teleported to the location and the proctors woke them up. For everyone else it was an instant teleportation except for the people in the house. That's all I really remember from the movie, any help finding the title would be greatly appreciated ",scifi

My copy of Foundation by Issac Asimov is missing chapters?,"I’m reading Foundation by Issac Asimov. I’m at Part IV, The Traders. The first chapter is chapter 1, but then the second chapter is labeled 4, and the third labeled 5, then 6, and so on.

I cannot tell if 1) It is simply a misprint and 4 is supposed to be 2 and 5 supposed to 3, etc., or 2) The book is missing chapters 2 and 3. I haven’t kept reading too far yet, but the chapter labeled 4 starts by introducing completely new characters than were in chapter 1. So, it seemed like this possibility is at least plausible.

It’s also possible this is on purpose, and that’s why I’m posting this, to see if anyone else’s copy is the same. It seems to me like that would be weird creative choice without any rhyme or reason  (unless it is explained later in the book).

What the fuck did Arthur C. Clarke smoke while writing „The Garden of Rama“?,"In one chapter im reading a classic sci-fi novel, the next chapter im suddenly reading some highly detailed descriptions about the social dynamics and anatomical issues of a 13 year old girl having sex with a 73 year old man. 

I was so impressed with rendezvous with rama, rama II wasnt nearly as good, now im a third into rama 3 and so far this book has been 1% sci-fi, 90% boring monologues from a super weird hyper intellectual overeducated character and her equally unrealistic hyper intelligent children, and yeah… the other 10% have been about this young girl having sex with an old man. Was Arthur Clarke some kind of a sexual degenerate? Or is this just the unrestrained chauvinist zeitgeist of the time the book was written in? Why is this (and so many other scifi books) filled to the top with unnecessary and out of place sexual content?

I will not put the book down because the good chapters are really good and i love the rama universe, but damn.. most of the chapters have really made my spine compress and generally have been super uncomfortable to churn through. 

I really dislike when a great sci-fi novel wastes so many of its pages on fleshing out uninteresting weird characters while the actual mind bending inspiring sci-fi concepts, ideas and the plot itself that i read the book for is starting to feel like a sidenote, and the plot is not advancing even a single millimeter.",scifi
Children of Memory (A. Tchaikovsky) -I just got lost,"I'm half way through the book and so far I had no problems following the plot. However I feel like I've missed something or misunderstood it.

When we first meet Liff she talks about seeing her grandfather wave at her and disappear in the forest. She claims it's not a dream, but nobody believes her, stating that her grandfather (grand-ancestor?) Holt is long dead.

But then Holt comes down from the Enkidu? What's up with all this? If Holt was in cryonic sleep in the space ship, why does Liff's family insist he's dead at the beginning of the story? And is he really Liff's grandfather or actually a great-great-great-grandfather?

The next problem I'm having: at one point the villagers kill Miranda, Portia, Fabian and Paul. Liff witness that. But a few chapters later Miranda (the interlocutor) is coming down with Holt from the spaceship. Huh?

I rechecked the beginning of each part and every Liff chapter says ""Imir, now"", so none of it seems to be happening in the past.

Also, if Holt introduced Miranda to the community, why is she later on poping in with a cover story that she's from the outer farms?

What is your Most Favorite SCI-FI Movie. ,I'm always curious to know which sci-fi movie holds a special place in your heart! Is it a classic like *Star Wars* or something more recent like *Interstellar*? Let’s talk about the films that expand our imagination and take us to new worlds.,scifi

I mean not robots malfunctioning but biological creatures that have an unstable enough body to explode from a hard impact or a beating or have some sort of internal chemical reaction that causes them to self destruct and explode asa last effort to take the hero with them, also thehero weapon can distable them to exploding like in cases where they explode from impact of the ground or a hard hit that activates their explosive property....

Those sci-fi/fantasy authors that don’t quite get categorized as such are my favorite,"Kurt Vonnegut is a sci-fi author that never gets put in that box. So is Borges, Kazuo Ishiguro, George Saunders and Haruki Murikami. These are some of my favorite authors in any genre. They all write about imaginary worlds where technological change has made people’s lives incredibly different but something about their books gets them categorized differently.

Maybe they’re too focused on the personal lives of the characters—like Kazuo Ishiguro making up a world where (-/:/@&amp;@-spoilers$@&amp;/&amp;/) just to write about the lives of three English boarding school students. Maybe the fact that their stories tend to be set in the present day with one weird technological difference makes them seem less like sci-fi—which tends to be set in the future. Maybe they take too many weird risks stylistically—like Saunders writing all his stories as the stream of consciousness diaries of in-universe characters. Maybe it’s because the validity and plausibility of the “science” is never explored, for example in Slaughterhouse 5 we don’t really care how time travel works or why. Time travel is just an excuse to tell a story about a war vet in a nonlinear way. 

Anyway I’m not trying to start a debate about what is and isn’t “real” sci-fi but just wondering if you’ve got any recommendations for authors like this.

I understood at least in the dream world and I thought that was crazy but I thought it was really cool to experience) and the twists are universes and timelines were being deleted all the time and people and their counterparts would start subterfuge and either eliminate and replace or delete their enemies entire timeline so that theirs can still thrive and it was. I guess a simulation where all the people were thinking they're alive and knowing that if they have the universe that succeeds to a level where race can survive by and thrive their race can survive and thrive then them and everyone that they know and love can live. So even when a universe or timeline had horrible chances, it showed so much. I guess it's greed at the heart of it but they would not back down no matter what their odds were.

I wrote a space opera game inspired by Babylon 5 and Deep Space 9,"A few years ago, I got invited by a new indie game studio to pitch a game to their new visual novel series.

I was never a visual novel fan per say, so I had no idea of where to start. Then I asked them: ""Can I try something slightly different?"" They said ""Sure!"", and here is Alexandria IV

I have always loved Babylon 5. The whole concept of a space station on the edge of Human Space, dealing with alien factions always on the brink  of war, the diplomacy by all means necessary, the cloak and dagger happening in the shadows...

So I proposed writing a game where YOU are the station commander, making decisions about complex topics, and the consequences affect not only the station, but the characters around you.

It's like an RPG, but without the numbers, I guess.

And now, close to releasing it, we realize how hard it is to market it. Because people have expectations and preconceptions when you put the ""Visual Novel"" tag on it.

So I figured, hey, let me check the people who like scifi, let me show if it makes sense to them. Let me ask for help.

Here is it. I'd love your opinion on what we made.

*“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”*

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books. Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven.

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy.

In Review: Alien Clay,"Note: In the absense on easily found rules I am formatting this according to the r/Fantasy rules, as I think it's less likely to be an issue for the mods. This is text taken from my blog, link at the end of this post. 

https://preview.redd.it/yj029wfe2fnd1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1999a11392237d26537a3626f9de136dc055683e

  
  
Theme is hard. If it's spread too thinly, an author's work can feel vapid and flimsy. If spread too thick, it can become tiring, or even annoying, as subtext becomes text and theme turns into sermon. The middle ground of ""just enough"" can be a difficult target to hit, and that target can vary from one book to another. Some stories lend themselves well to thematic weight and literary merit, while others work better as pulp.  
  
Adrian Tchaikovsky has never been the most subtle thematic writer. Even his early *Shadow of the Apt* books were concerned with the lines between ethics and science. But in the last decade or so, he's leaned into theme as a core pillar of his writing style. When it works, it works really well. *Children of Time* and the *Tyrant Philosopher* series are brilliant, carefully blending plot, pacing, world-building and character almost seamlessly. However, *Children of Ruin* and *Children of Memory* both made the occasional concession to plot and pacing in service to the idea and it showed. Both were still really good books don't get me wrong, but they weren't brilliant in the same way as *Children of Time*.

So, what does this have to do with *Alien Clay*? Let me put it this way: *Alien Clay* is the *definitive* Tchaikovsky book. It is the perfect encapsulation of everything Tchaikovsky has done thus far. If you haven't read Tchaikovsky, I can safely recommend this book, because at the end of it, you will at least know if you like his work. Everything else I've read (though I haven't read everything) by him is just a variant on the style present in this book. At times he's more subtle with theme, at times less, but the *style* is all here and perfectly summarized.

Full disclosure, I loved it. While a little blatant for some, this book has everything I love about Tchaikovsky with very little I don't. His pacing is on point, neither moving to fast or too slow. His character work is similarly well done. Professor Arten Daghdev is well realized in the first-person perspective. Though Tchaikovsky's dry humor and sense of irony remain intact, the switch from 3rd to 1st person limits how much the other characters are allowed to breathe. Don't get me wrong, they are well crafted and interesting, but outside of Daghdev, they lack the same spark as some of the characters from titles like *City of Last Chances*, and *Children of Time.* This isn't a failing per say, but it is a trade-off.

That trade-off though is probably worth on the whole. While the cast outside of Daghdev occasionally feels a little lackluster, the world of Kiln is exquisitely realized through his eyes. Wonder and dread blend together in glorious detail. The threat is real, but so is the fascination. As Daghdev grows to understand Kiln, it really felt like I was working alongside him. The biological structures which make this world tick are intriguing and plausible. That only makes the sensations they evoke more horrifying, more wondrous, and more satisfying to read. The strange symbioticism of the world is familiar enough to be understandable, but alien enough to be threatening. Over and over these differences are explored, highlighted, emphasized, and then ultimately subverted in ways that drive home the book's thematic points. It really is classic Tchaikovsky and I couldn't be happier with it.

All that said, this book won't be for everybody. As I mentioned, Tchaikovsky isn't exactly subtle with his thematic intent. Kiln and the Earth Mandate are thinly veiled philosophical arguments. Kiln, for its part, plays the familiar roll of empathy, while the Mandate is cast as doctrine. It's a familiar dialogue and long-time fans may grow tire of retreading the same piece of philosophical land. Readers familiar with Tchaikovsky may also be able to easily guess the broad strokes of how the book ends, though there are plenty of smaller twists. Honestly, I'm still not entirely sure if I find the ending unsettling, or encouraging. Both possibly, and I think both are intended readings. Empathy isn't always kind, and it always has a cost. But it will always change us.

Blindsight: a confusing masterpiece ,"The title says it all. Well, not all, because I also have a lot of questions. I’ve read the notes and it doesn’t actually cover most of the things I’m gonna ask about. These are more like round table type questions cause I’m an obsessed no life basement dwelling barnacle with nothing better to do. 

* Do you think Sarasti was ever Sarasti?

* Do you think there’s any merit to the idea that consciousness hinders efficiency and was likely a catastrophic accident? 

* What would Rorschach have become if left to its own devices? What would it have done?

* Is it at all realistic that someone could enter someone else’s digital simulation, such as when Siri goes to see his mom? You’d think if group sim tech was available, everyone wouldn’t just be in their own Heaven “talking to themselves,” as Siri puts it. 

* What the hell actually happened with Susan James at the end?

* Why did Rorschach make the grunts shoot the disabled grunt? 

* Sarasti didn’t really *grape* Siri… did he? Surely that was a metaphor. 

You can feel free to answer some, none, or all of these. Or say anything at all, that’d be fine too. I’m obsessed with this book and have read it 4x and still have so many questions.

Pretty Please Point Out My Misconceptions and Errors Regarding Space Weapons,"Hi folks,

I'm in the early stages of putting together some thoughts on a sci-fi setting (what I'm going to do with it - fiction writing, ttrpg, game design, just dinking around on my own - I don't know yet), and one thing of many that I'm considering is that thing that we all love so much - space combat. I want to do my best to get things as ""accurate"" (which is to say, ""plausible"") as they realistically can be, but I'm far from a particle physicist or a rocket scientist, so I'm just kinda going by what I can read here and there.

But, in the interest of getting things as close to right as I reasonably can, I'd like to share my thoughts here on space weapons, their utility, their strengths and weaknesses, and a bit on their tactical uses. I'd appreciate it if you would just tear me apart on this. I mean, don't be a jerk about it, but I'd love for you to tell me what I'm getting wrong here. I know, I know, it's my universe, I can build it how I want, and I might ignore *some* advice in the interest of a better story, but I'd like to keep things, again, as plausible as possible.

So, without further ado, here are my basic (and, admittedly, very rough) thoughts on: laser weapons, particle beam weapons, railguns, torpedoes/missiles, and autocannons.

&gt;Laser weapons have an incredibly long range, are almost perfectly precise, and are basically impossible to dodge, but they take up an immense amount of power in order to strengthen them to the point where they can start cutting into a hull. Certain kinds of armors, like ceramic and ablative armor, are particularly good at dissipating lasers and spreading out their heat over the hull of a ship. Therefore it is possible to use lasers to cut into the hull of a ship, or to heat it up to the point that its inhabitants are cooked, but this is a very inefficient use of lasers.

&gt;Instead, lasers are mainly used in three ways. The first is as a blinder; pinpoint lasers are used to target enemy sensor arrays, lighting them up and blinding them. It's similar to a high-powered flood light pointing directly at a car's windshield; it blinds them so that they have a harder time seeing where their opponent is.

&gt;The second use of lasers still relates to heat management, but instead of shooting the hull of a ship with a laser and heating the ship, the lasers target the enemy ship's radiators. Heating up the radiators means that they will be less able to dissipate heat from inside the ship. Some radiators are also splayed out from the body of the ship, like wings, attached by comparatively small connectors; lasers can be used to cut the small connectors, effectively shearing off the radiators and making them useless.

&gt;The final main use of lasers is as a point defense weapon; lasers can target incoming torpedoes, missiles, drones, and other extremely fast crafts before they strike the ship.

&gt;Particle weapons, on the other hand, have much more direct uses. Their range is considerably shorter, but it's still significant, and within that range band they are very nearly as accurate as lasers. They are also much more versatile; depending on the kind of particles they're launching, they can deal damage in a variety of ways, from kinetically breaking up a ship's hull and armor, to heating it up like a laser, to passing right through the armor and irradiating the ship or taking out its electronics systems. Particle beams also have an edge on railguns in terms of their range. Inside a medium range band, railguns do become very effective; a direct hit from a railgun can crack a ship in half. They also don't heat up your own ship nearly as much as laser and particle weapons do. That said, they still pack quite a lot of recoil for a space weapon, and they have a slower rate of fire than particle weapons.

&gt;Torpedoes and missiles are also useful at medium range; they're harder to predict than other kinetic weapons, since they can adjust their own flightpath along the way. They can't dodge an enemy ship's defensive lasers, but even this can be a strength to the torpedo; if you launch a large volley of torpedoes at an enemy ship and you force them to use their defensive lasers, you may not hit them with a torpedo, but those laser weapons will contribute to the heating of the ship, which is still dangerous for them. If deployed at the right time, and in the right way, a clever ship commander can force their opponent to choose between overheating and taking a direct hit.

&gt;Finally, autocannons are a very short-range weapon. They're mostly used defensively; they can take out incoming torpedoes like defensive lasers can, and while they're not nearly as accurate as the lasers, they also generate heat outside the main body of the ship, so their heat contributes less to internal warming. Autocannons can also be used as an offensive weapon, on the rare occasion that ships end up very close to one another. The rounds an autocannon can put out often outnumber a volley of torpedoes by five thousand or more to one, so, while defensive lasers can target them and destroy them, the lasers can be easily overwhelmed at close range. Autocannon rounds can tear through ablative armor, shred radiators and engine cones, and punch holes right through the hull.

So... what do you think about all this? What problems are there in my reasoning? What am I completely missing, that would make a physicist read my book or play my game, laugh, roll their eyes, and say ""What a fool""? Am I missing out on other forms of weapon systems that I've forgotten (for example, I'm sure folks will be thinking about electronic warfare as well)? Feel free to comment on as much or as little as you like, I'm just trying to cover my blind spots the best I can.

Anyway, if you took the time to read all this, and *especially* if you're leaving a comment to help me correct course, thank you very very much!",scifi
What are the best works of science fiction that shows what interstellar trade between different alien species will look like?,"
I came up with this one after watching some of Isaac Arthur's videos. So what I'm looking for are the best works of science fiction that show what interstellar trade between different alien species will look like, based on the following:

* According to Isaac Arthur it seems likely that trade between different species will be focused on the following goods: feed and fertilizer, raw materials (Ex: minerals, gases, and ice), luxury goods (Ex: furniture, dresses, jewelry, designer clothing etc.), and goods that have artistic/entertainment value (Ex: Comics, literature, tv, movies, paintings, statues, toys, board games, video games, etc). The buying and selling of any technology and scientific information might be allowed but it will all depend on what regulations interstellar species have on giving way this sort of stuff. For example, given the destructive power of the Alcubierre drive I don't think this is the sort of thing one can just sell or give away to another alien race \[1,3\].
* Interstellar trade ports are most likely going to look like O'Neill cylinders, like the ones Isaac Arthur describes in his video Multi-Species Civilization &amp; Co-Alien Habitats. Space stations designed to accommodate different species biological needs. They will most likely be used for neutral meeting zones where two or more parties meetup to hammer out trade deals/agreements and they will also have warehouses for storing trade goods before said goods are shipped off to their final destination. And they can also serve as stopping points for space freighters to resupply, refuel, and repairs \[2\].
* Speaking of space freighters I'm guessing that that the space ships hauling this stuff will be pretty large since most goods will be shipped in bulk. The size will crew vary depending on the cargo and the composition of the crew will either be automated, organic, or both \[4\]. As far as ownership goes, the freighter will most likely be owned by a corporation that is either privately controlled or state controlled depending on the alien's economy. The reason why is because assuming the ship is powered by nuclear fusion, or has an Alcubierre Drive, or both then interstellar governments are going to regulate who can own such potential WMDs. Of course they might be willing to lease these freighters, provided the ""Captain"" can cover the cost of refuels and repairs, and in the case of organic crews, supplies of fuel and medicine. And of course, all crew members will have undergo background checks to ensure that they are not a security risk.

***ASTROMANTICS***

*by Angels of Libra*

--

*The year is 1964 and the small peaceful planet of Astromides in the Andromeda Galaxy (2,480,000 lightyears from Earth) is under attack. A mysterious alien race known only as ‘The Saucer Men’ are invading and by using their secret mind control weapon, ‘the Mind Phaser,’ they are threatening to take control of the planet. A battle has commenced on Ursa Major Space Station, the last line of defence for Astromides. The planet’s inhabitants, the Astromantics are losing the battle and in haste, a small band of renegades flee across the galaxy in search of aid.* 

*Arriving on Earth, the renegade Astromantics are met by the Alien Affairs Investigation Agency (A.A.I.A.), a secret agency with a base on the Moon. The Astromantics ask for their help in taking back their planet from the Saucer Men.* 

*Upon hearing their story, Earth’s most decorated Astronaut, Space Commander Joe Bondy volunteers to go alone on a mission to take on the Saucer Men. The Astromantics and the A.A.I.A watch on a live broadcast as Bondy travels in his ultra high speed rocket to the Andromeda Galaxy. Before he can get close enough to make contact, Bondy’s ship is blown up and the broadcast is terminated.* 

*With not many options left, the A.A.I.A. suggest an alliance with the Radar Men from Mars, whose super powered Martian Space Radars could help them track down the Saucer Men’s home planet.* 

*While observing the Saucer Men on the Martian’s Radar Station, the Astromantics and delegates from the A.A.I.A. cross paths with the Space Cowboy, a sharp shooter gun-for-hire who wants “nothing to do with no-one.” However, upon meeting A.A.I.A. super spy ‘Agent Astropenny,’ he becomes infatuated with her and cannot refuse the mission. Space Cowboy sets off on a voyage to the famed Komet St. Pauli in search of a hallucinatory drink known only as the ‘Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Schorle’ that makes the drinker immune to the Saucer Men’s meanest weapon, the mind phaser.* 

*Soon, word reaches the Astromantics that the Saucer Men have infiltrated Earth’s defences and have begun to enslave the people of Earth. There is not much time left before all is lost for our heroes. Space Cowboy’s mission is now more urgent than ever.* 

*The fate of the galaxy lies in his hands…*",scifi

Revelation Space series is completely forgettable,"Don't misunderstand my topic title, I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying it just doesn't stick in my memory. 

So far I've read Revelation Space and Redemption Arc and I just started Absolution Gap. This series has been on my radar for a while because there are a lot of people recommending it and it rates fairly high up in a lot of lists of Sci-Fi that ""you should read"". 

With all that said I realized a couple of days ago that I really can't recall any details from the books (RS and RA). Usually I have a pretty good retention of the books I read and I can still call to memory a fair amount of details from books I've read 25 years ago but with RS and RA the only things I can think of is a vague memory of the overarching plot. 

Is this just me or does any one else also have this ""issue"" with these books?

  
P.S. While I don't think the books are bad, I do have my fair share of criticisms about them (and a lot of that criticism is linked my expectations going in based on what people say about them on all the places that recommend the books). But that's another topic for another day ",scifi
"Books with inspiring concepts, technology, and characters ","In the last few years I feel that most of the scifi content I've consumed has been very bleak. I still enjoy the grim reality of cyberpunk stories or 40k lore but it's leaving a void that I need to fill. A few years back I was actually motivated to learn more about software &amp; cyber because of some fun ideas I had from consuming Cyberpunk 2077 content which actually led to some valuable career growth and fun side projects. So I'm in search of content that's more inspiring. I like to design and build prototypes, write code, weld things etc. and I guess I'm trying to find a muse within a book. 

I guess what I'm looking for is a book that has any of the following:  

* Technology that perhaps isn't scientifically too far gone from reality. I don't like technobabble but like cool stuff that would make an engineer excited
* Characters that are inspiring, either through their actions, adventures, or qualities such as being of strong character or having strong character development
* Not completely bleak, but ""against all odds"" and perhaps a happy ending would be nice
* I'm not really looking for Andy Weir for what it's worth. It's hard to explain but I feel like they're crowd pleasers, not that I dislike them. 

I almost feel embarrassed admitting this but I haven't read many books in almost 10 years. I've just been to focused on school, career, and other crap so I appreciate any suggestions!

STAR TREK: WORST CASE SCENARIO ,,scifi
I'm looking for a sci fi book/audio book and I need the internets Help!!!,"So I was listening to an audio book on YouTube and it has now been removed. I started listening to it before bed each night to help me fall asleep. I found I actually wanted to listen to the story when I'm awake and at work. But due to copyright or something the video has been taken down and of course I now only remember the basic plot of the first 6 chapters and none of the characters names only their ranks and positions on the ship. 

My hope is someone on reddit can help me figure out the name of this story so I can find it and continue my quest to actually listen/read it completely. 

What I remember of the story: 

The story kicks off with the main character a Lt. Commander and cheif medical officer on our ship (who's name begins with an A, but im not sure on the name). He is working with tissue/organ replication and sadly cannot witness the great spectral that the rest of the ship gets to enjoy about entering a new system of space. 

He later gets to sit with some colleagues and friends. One of which is a young female marine Sargent, who actually like talking with our egg head medical officer about his work with organ cloning and all its cool potential. 

While light heartedly being teased and teasing back with the marines and colleagues he is eating with about patching up the marines and growing a new brain for one of the marines if his gets busted out (a joke about it not taking long to grow cause his is ""marine"" sized), the MC notices a shimmer is space just outside the view port and asks the question ""what is that?"" Which than kicks this party into the danger zone. 

Turns out it's a stealth ship that ends up attacking the MC's ship. EVERYONE is called to Battle stations. Our MC makes his way to med-bay through a sea of crewmen and marines is full power armor as the ships intercoms inform everyone the ship has ""unauthorized boardes"". Upon making it to med-bay his subordinate officer and him begin preping medical pods and gear in preparation for casualties. 

This proves to be a good thing. As he ship is being boarded and the fighting begins in Ernest our MC finds himself with combat literally at his med-bays front door. Marines barricade themselves and prepare to hold out as the attackes open fire they are spreading a mysterious yellow gas as they move throughout the ship. 

The marines engage the enemy and are sadly ill equipped to win as their Energy Pulse rifles don't seem to work on the intruders. A marine in power armor is downed and our MC runs to their aid to bring them to the med-bay. After successfully drawing our power armor covered marine into med Bay the MC opens it up to find our young marine Sargent is really bad shape (she was shot in the mid section and had a shredded stomach, ruptured artery and a few broken ribs). 

MC picks up our Young Sargent and gets her into a ""regen pod"" (it's either that or regen tank) and starts to try and help his subordinate who at this time is trying to bring another injured marine to med-bay. Tragically this doesn't happen as the ships intercom says ""emergency containment activated"" and closes the med-bay door before our subordinate can reach it. 

As our MC trys to open the med-bay door the ship goes completely dark as all power is lost. 
In all the dark he notices a red light that is our Regen pod our young injured marine is in. It reads ""regeneration failed/interruped"". MC removes the young marine from the now useless pod and proceeds to close up her injuries using the med supplies that were prepared when the attack first started. He puts her on a cardiac support machine to help her heart keep beating regularly and closes up her wounds as best he can. Not long after that some power is then restored. 

A new problem arises as the power coming back means the air circulation has returned and now the med-bay is filling with this mysterious yellow gas! MC is forced to move the injured SGT. and himself into the air lock for the isolation lab that is connected to the medical bay. He then goes back to retrieve a medkit and is touched by the gas as he retrieves it and returns to the air lock and cycles it. The gas seems to cause extreme pain and burning sensation on contact with skin. 

After getting into the isolation lab the ship then takes a hard turn that stresses its inertial dampeners to there limit. Thankfully our duo is safe and now in a place we're the gas cannot reach them as the lab is comes with its own independent life support system as to reduce the chance of contaminating the MC experiments.  

MC now can access the cameras on the ship.
While looking at the cameras the MC sees all the carnage our ""pirates"" (that's what he's been calling them though not yet confirmed)
Enemies have left. Strangly there are no traces of the Pirates and it would seem that our duo are the only survivors left. Not long after this the Sgt. takes a sudden turn and our Mc is forced to put do cpr to get her heart running and he puts her on full lung and heart life support and is worried her brain function is failing. 

He then goes back out into the med-bay to retrieve a containment suit so he can move around the ship to figure out what to do next. This goes poorly for him due to the yellow gas still being present in the room. (Though now it's being scrubbed our by the ships air cleaners) he does succeed in getting back with the suit. After a brief ""pass out nap"" Mc checks the ships logs to see If an SOS bacon was sent out. (It was but it's unconfirmed if to made it out before the enemy could have shoot it down) he then notices that 2 escape pods are launched heading towards the planet that the ship was intended to go too. Tragically they are both shoot down by the stealth ship and the ship MC is on. 

 MC then checks cameras and sees that the Pirates are still aboard the ship and are on its bridge. He then dawns the suit and picking up a pulse rifle starts to make his way to the ships bridge. On his way he realizes that the Pirates power armor has sheilds much like ships do and that his energy pulse rifle would be useless against them. So he decides to head to the armory for some good old fashion lead throwing guns. But just before he gets there he is forced to divert into the engineering shop next door as he hears footsteps heading his way from the armory. 


This is were I end as I don't remember anything else other then the MC does make it to the planet and meets with another female scientist/officer. 

If any of this rings a bell for anyone, please help and message me the name of the book/story. 

I hope this info is enough and thank you for any help given. ",scifi

Looking for Recommendations: Books/Movies/Shows/Games Involving Heat Management In Space,"Hey folks,

I'm looking for some recommendations for any sci-fi books (or movies or shows or games or anything!) that emphasize a specific aspect of spacecraft and space combat: heat management. 

As you may be aware, heat one of the biggest dangers on board a spacecraft. Without an atmosphere around you, regulating heat becomes incredibly difficult; your main options are diverting heat into heat sinks which can be jettisoned (but the sinks themselves are heavy, and once you eject them you're left with nothing), or radiators to radiate the heat away (which works, but radiation is the least efficient way to get rid of heat, so it's slow).

In space battles that utilize this idea, you're just as likely to die from the heat inside your craft as you are from a bullet punching a hole through your hull or a torpedo blowing your ship apart. Laser weapons, insofar as they exist at all, would be most useful in heating up your opponent's ship; just make sure you don't heat up your own ship too much in generating the laser to begin with! 

Stealth becomes a much more dangerous game as well; going dark means disconnecting your radiators, so it becomes a race against the thermostat; can you sneak by the trade route patrol or the DMZ checkpoint without being seen before your crew cooks from the inside?

Anyway, these are some things that I'd love to see a competent writer explore. Are there any books, movies, shows, games, etc., that anyone can recommend which include these ideas in them? Obviously things that *also* have compelling stories, deeply developed characters, and engaging worlds go to the top of the list, but I'd take something that is lacking in the other areas if it at least handles these things well.

What should I be checking out? Please and thank you!",scifi

"I just watched Tribunal, Outer Limits 1998: Season 5, Episode 12. What an excellent episode.","Though this was not the first time I watched this episode, I thought I would take the time to post about it here in case some of you might not have seen it. 

I think it is a powerful story. Very light on the special effects and no over the top action, it is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest time travel episodes to ever appear in any anthology TV series. The whole episode stands on storytelling and acting.

It's the story of a lawyer, Aaron Zgierski, who is attempting to prove that an elderly retired man is actually the notorious former concentration camp commander and NAZI war criminal Karl Rademacher. 

Without evidence and seemingly at the end of his rope, a mysterious stranger shows up, willing to provide irrefutable evidence that the aging man is in fact the former concentration camp commander. Unbeknownst to Zgierski his mysterious benefactor is a time traveler from something over a hundred years in the future. There are a few twists and turns that I won't spoil here.

Excellent performances by Saul Rubinek as the NAZI hunter Aaron Zgierski, and Alex Diakun as the time traveler Nicholas Prentice. In fact the episode was so well received and Diakun's character was so popular that he reprised his time traveling character, Nicholas Prentice, in two additional episodes, season 6 episode 17 ""Gettysburg"" and season 7 episode 15 ""Time to Time"" though in my opinion neither rise to the level of Tribunal. 

Has anyone else seen this episode, and if so, what did you think of it?

As a long time scifi fan and time travel aficionado I can watch this episode again and again. 

If you are a fan of time travel stories and have not seen this episode it is available on Roku for free.

Andrew Detmer had the potential to become one of the most OP movie characters of all time ,"To summarise, Andrew Detmer is a character from the Sci Fi movie “chronicle” in which him and two of his friends come across a crashed meteor and develop supernatural abilities (mainly telekinesis) from interacting with it.

Now as far as their abilities go there appears to be no cap on how strong they become, as long as they keep “training” their TK. To put it simply only after a couple days, while injured and highly dazed. Detmer was a city level threat completely no selling entire SWAT teams in which he could only be stopped by another Super powered individual (his cousin)

He also had a plethora of other abilities such as weather manipulation, supersonic flight, telepathy nigh immortality (force fields) among others. He was genuinely an Avengers level threat. 

If he kept training and developing his abilities imagine how powerful he could have potentially became after only a year, not to mention a decade. The novelisation states there was truly no limit to how powerful he could become. He very well could have become a godly level entity totally unstoppable. ",scifi

Is the infinite improbability drive a type of hyperdrive or warpdrive?,"So the infinite improbability drive is from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. In the wiki it says:

*The Infinite Improbability Drive was a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without ""tedious mucking about in hyperspace.""*

A warpdrive is defined by a drive that warps space around the drive. Meaning that instead of the ship or vessel moving through space, the space is moving instead while the vessel is protected by a bubble.

A hyperdrive is defined by a drive that uses a higher dimension to travel through space.

Earth was just ""moved"" one day, and the story talked about how people managed and lived under this new sky.

*If you’re a Terminator fan, watch Zero.*

But also true…

*If you’re a Terminator fan, you’re not missing anything if you skip it.* 

It’s not really expanding the lore. It’s a remix of Genisys and Animatrix 3rd-eye energy with plot elements stolen from I, Robot. The fundamental Terminator tropes are dead-horse beaten once again like they had a checkbox list of fan service items.

Definitely one of the coolest plots an Alien franchise has done and it was extremely well paced until near the end but again that was probably because these idiotic Instagram pages posted the pictures of the end reveal essentially 

Nonetheless it was a great addition to the Franchise and easily my favorite since Aliens. Tensions were high all the way through and the it was extremely well done visually.

Is there a series of novels that are a sci fi equivalent to high fantasy's The Legend of Drizzt by RA Salvatore? More in the text.,"Basically novels which tell fairly simple but complete stories, are made to be very entertaining and require little effort to read.  

I'm interested in training myself to do speed reading and am using training material that requires a fairly low reading level for it.  Material like complex philosophy, academic research papers and textbooks about subjects like calculus and physics are horrible for that purpose due to their difficulty.  Simple material is better for that purpose.

edit.  It also makes the training easier to do when the training material is entertaining to read. 

I also have the problem of getting bored of books before completing them.  I think if I read them more quickly it would be more enjoyable to read the story before my interest and attention span run out.

I am also aware of people claiming that speed reading doesn't work based on some studies done by psychologists.  However, they have the problem of having test subjects who don't really care and are not putting a long term effort into it.  I want to see if I can do it.

Or 

Zombies or ghoulish type creatures; 

Or

Cannibalism perhaps featuring;

Demonic type creatures in a sci fi context, perhaps, creatures with red eyes in the darkness; 

Maybe a person in an outpost going mad and killing all the other occupants that it ends up haunted 

Or

A sense of being hunted in the book

Or 

something totally different, in a first person POV of someone contracting a mind virus while stranded on a distant planet or such, and slowly losing their sanity - separate from the other reccs above

It's like Andy Weir either based the character off some B-grade cheesy sci-fi film or he wrote it with a Hollywood adaptation of the book already in mind. Also I understand that she doesn't have a STEM background, but for an administrator at ESA, it's unrealistic that she doesn't even have the basic knowledge of General Science and had to be spoonfed all the information. Also the interaction amongst other people on Earth was cheesy and full of stereotypes. Everytime Ryland would get flashback of his days at Earth, I would get flashback of movies like Core and Armageddon 😂.


I don't know much about the accuracy of science, so can't comment on that but it didn't become too overbearing for a normal person so ig it's fine on that front too. Can't wait to see Ryan Gosling play Grace (I think he is the right choice), but it would be nice if they make the things a bit serious. 


I read this book after finishing Rendezvous with Rama (absolute marvel of a book btw) and probably will be either reading Cloud Atlas or Foundation next (you guys help me decide which one should I read first)

Looking for novel: human colony attacked by mind-control space tulips,"In the late 90s, I found an SF novel in a public library with the following premise, which I only remember roughly but vividly: a human space colony is attacked by an infestation of giant sessile space flowers (I think they were tulip-like) which emanated mind-control rays, driving most of the colony mad.  The survivors were then pursued by little girls who the tulips turned somehow into murder machines (they also have some kind of mutagenic powers).  I vaguely recall one character was a Catholic or Greek Orthodox priest, but maybe I'm just imagining it.   

It turns out that the tulips are preparing the way for larger colony vessel of their own kind.  There is no dialogue or communication with the mind-control space tulips who appear to communicate with each other via light beams.  

Does anyone remember anything like this, or did I just hallucinate it?  Is there an author or a title? It was probably written in the 80s or before, if I had to guess.  I've been unable to find search terms that find anything like it on Google.  Hopefully one of the enthusiasts on this subreddit remembers it...",scifi
The relationship between engineers and xenomorphs.,"In early drafts of Prometheus, it's all but stated there was a progenitor race called the deacons who created the engineers as biomechanical servants, only to wipe themselves out. According to these scripts, the engineers are just extremely advanced androids trying to recreate their former masters. Videos that explore these ideas online are common, and I've posted the link to one here. 

[Who Created Engineers ? Origins Explained || Theories (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSp07bwW1tA)

I'm just wondering what your thoughts are, and what it might mean for the future of the alien franchise. That androids might be in the process of replacing humans is an interesting avenue, one I would like to see the franchise go down. I have to admit, Prometheus would have been a much better film if they had settled with one of the much earlier scripts. ",scifi

Just released the new demo and trailer for my dystopian sci-fi narrative-driven survival game... Hopefully it fits in here!,"Hi! I'm the solo-indie developer of [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi), a dystopian sci-fi, physics-driven survival/base-building game, and I just released a [new demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi) and gameplay trailer to celebrate today's Steam Space Exploration Fest!

As a lover of sci-fi I couldn't help but make a game with a strong sci-fi narrative, themed around dystopian ultracapitalist corporations, a forgotten conspiracy, and futuristic mining and exploration!

I hope you don't mind me sharing the game here in your community, I think that it should align with your interests!

☑ Key Features:

* Descend into the depths of an alien planet - Aethus - to mine for valuable resources in a tactile, physicalised world powered by Unreal Engine 5.
* Experience a compelling dystopian narrative as you attempt to escape the grasp of your former employer, a planet-controlling, ultra-capitalist megacorp - ARC.
* Utilise both your mining laser and explosives to gather resources, then Prospect your finds to discover the rarest ores and gem to package up according to demand in order to sell for maximum profit.
* Construct your own outpost from the ground-up using the resources you mine from the planet, building highly customisable habitats to extend your reach underground, explore mysterious new biomes, and automate your gameplay.
* Discover and purchase new plans for a wealth of habitats, facilities, furniture and decorations before using creative building and terraforming tools to create your perfect cosy and functional base.
* After an expedition, process your haul back at base by constructing numerous types of facilities to refine raw materials, smelt and synthesise products, and craft new items!
* Sell products to the Corporation to earn credits, then Upgrade your equipment to unlock powerful new abilities to aid in your mining efforts.

🎮 [The new demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi) lets you play the first 1-2 hours of the game as you set up your mining outpost on the surface of an alien planet and start delving into the depths of the caverns below it, and an introduction to the dystopian sci-fi narrative which drives the game forward! Oh, and it features a Scottish AI mining drone companion, so what's not to love?

📽 [The new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80) shows a bunch of new features like hydroponic farming for food and crafting ingredients! I absolutely **HATE** making trailers (I love making the game!) so I hope it comes across OK!

✅ If you like what you see, [consider giving the game a Wishlist on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redscifi)
Every single one helps a solo-indie like me! 🙏

📣 I'd love to hear what you think about the game, either in the comments or perhaps 'face to face' on the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/WJEBMYgpgt)

Thanks for having me!",scifi
Mixed feelings about Battlestar Galactica 2004,"First this is not meant as an insult, these are just some thoughts about my point of view and if somone enjoys/loves the show, thats awesome. And spoilers ahead for the whole show

I started to watch the show because I missed it back then and I have seen thats it is the highest ranked Space/Sci-Fi series (or one of the highest), so I was intrigued. I am now at the 4th season and I must admit that I am pretty disapointed. It is a chore to watch the next episode but I want to finish it. The show is constantly using buzzwords like ""God, faith, destiny etc."" but actually doesn't do anything with these topics. I have the feeling like the writers just wanted to be ""deep"" and used these words but they never achieved anything with it.

The show feels like your average 2000 show with many filler episodes. The best part until now was the arrival of pegasus and how Adama started to loose control but they kept this arc pretty short and this conflict ended fast.

The cylons are the biggest joke, and I don't understand how a viewer can be kept in the dark for so long. The show actually doesn't do anything interesting with them, in the first season we know that they can look/be humans and this sounds very interesting but the show drops the ball here. Later you learn that they can upload to the x-cloud but they have to be in range. I don't know how can you upload anything when you are build biologically. As cylons arrived at new caprica, they really felt like your psycho ex that wants to be near you, and she somehow always is at the same party as you are. I don't know this whole arc and motivation felt weird and spoiler alarm, 3 episodes later they are all back at galactica and everything is back to normal.

The acting/actors are pretty mediocre at best. No wonder you don't see them in any other known shows. Xena (lucy lawless) was the only one I recognized and I think she somehow didn't fit in this role. She is awesome but not in this role. But I also understand that if the script/writing is bad you can't save it with acting alone.

Characters develop in circles. The president has cancer, than she is cured and then she has cancer again... (thats deep)

Gaius takes almost center stage in this show but he is boring. Doctor who becomes President who becomes Jesus/Prophet or something like that?

The new boomer lady. For a time she is an outsider but after a while she becomes just a part of the crew and is completly in the background. Kinda wasted potential.

The half cylon half human baby was supposed to be something important, yeah it turns out it actually doesn't matter. And the baby from ""Chief"" was also half cylon and that didn't do anything. Maybe something later will happen but I don't know at this point.

What I like is they do kill people so you don't have this safety feeling ""nothing will happen to them""

The character I like the most is Old Adama, I think his performance is good but even here I will put Hammond from SG-1 above him.

So I just want to know your opinion, does someone had the same experience? Please don't be mad at me, it's fine if you like the show.",scifi

Children of Time,"I think it took me 3 months to finish this book (I blame Portia), when I reach a human chapter I finish it in no time, and sleep on the spider chapters, until of course I reached the final act. 


Spider-wise: I don't know why, but I never cared for the spiders, all these chapters about how they build their civilization, is like reading a history book that you will never need its context. 

Human-wise: Kern and Guyen represented a massively entertaining train wreck of a villain, they just carried me to finish this book, I think kern's dual messages will stay with me for a long time.

Ending: A portia says ""we will show them the error of their ways"" and then proceeds to drug the humans with this hallucinating virus that tells them they are related - and it goes both ways (spiders will think this too)- aaaand this is it, which felt very anticlimactic for me, but I think a war between ants and humans would have taken a whole book to tell.

Trying to find a book about a killer robot.,"I listened to this audiobook several years back non Scribd and I'm trying to find it again (can not remember name) spoilers ahead incase someone knows the story but have not finished it.

The synopsis as well as I remember:
Humans have developed robots that self replicate that they put on planets to mine out and after so long humans return to take the recourses.
A human ship comes to one of the planets to check out the progress of the robots
The main robot is basically a ""Forman"" or ""supervisor "" bot that has some AI  and makes sure that everything goes as scheduled.

**spoiler**
I can't remember why but somehow the bot becomes sentient and the humans end up fighting the robots and the main robot ends up creating a needle device that it uses to ""download"" the brains of the humans that it stores in a holding device on its back that it uses to use their knowledge and become smarter.

 The end of the book, the main human character is ""downloaded"" and it reveals that all of the humans it downloaded are still alive inside of it, and it shows another human ship coming in orbit.

My brain insists the story was “Monster Kidnaps Girl at Mad Scientist’s Command!” by Lawrence Watt-Evans, but I might be wrong about that.

Chakobsa Language (Dune),"I am curious about the history of the language before the Fremen used it as a battle language, but I haven't come up with a definitive answer yet. Here's what I found.

# Humans are Weird – A Dozen Times Before

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-a-dozen-times-before](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-a-dozen-times-before)

In the early dawn stillness the rustling of his own wings echoed back to Prince Trill from a thousand points in the massive banquet hall. From the great archways, designed for their human guests, the sounds of the local forest waking provided a soothing background to his musings. Tonight would be the trial of his colonies systems. Hosting even one of the massive mammals was a challenge that was quite simply impossible for most pre-contact Winged systems. Finding enough space alone for a human was difficult, and even if a human could comfortably fold themselves into a mass storage cargo hold the weight distribution of their walking would destroy paths and the wrenching forces of their climbing would damage fragile new growth.

“And that is all merely the physics of the matter,” Prince Trill murmured to himself as he examined the medical report from the branch University studies.

The chances of a pathogen jumping species in any meaningful way was the merest echo of a possibility in most cases. However taking a mammalian species with that great a caloric intake and that inefficient a digestion system meant the sewage processing plants were going to be overwhelmed. The various methods of disposing of the human’s waste suggested by the medical staff, overeager engineers , and under-supervised private inventors ranged from simply practical to quite frankly frightening.

Prince Trill heaved a sigh and moved onto the next page. Something caught his eye and he clicked with anticipation. It looked like one of the human delegates had yet to turn in a medical verification form. That really was something he should see to himself. It could be delegated to one of the University Medicos of course, but this gave him the option to interview the newly arrived human himself again. He tucked the notes into his carry pouch and lifted off from his high perch. The rest of his wing slipped out from their various perches and started to follow him. He flicked a wing to send most of them back to the home tree and all but two pulled off.

Prince Trill flew out into the early morning light and took a moment to appreciate the thick canopy over head. He still had memories of his first flights and the searing sun falling through the gaps in the young forest touching his wings. Now the canopy was solid at least. It was still a far cry from the untold generations deep canopy of the homeworld, but this was one of the few colonies that could boast a complete deliberately grown canopy. He sought out the broad walkways that wound round the trunks and connected the domed huts grown from branches. He spotted the one he was looking for easily enough.

Mary Smythe seemed to be an older human than the spacefaring Winged tended to see. Prince Trill wondered if that explained her tendency to decorate her living space. Long wings of patterned cloth hung over her windows making a not unpleasing contrast to the bark of the walls. Prince Trill came to a landing on the greeting pad set beside the huts door and pulled at the bell set there. The musical chimes sounded from inside the house and he felt the entire hut vibrate as the massive mammal began moving about. The strings of beads that formed the door parted and the human’s smiling face peered out.

“Who’s there?” she called out.

Mary’s face was covered in wrinkles and her hair was flecked with silver coloring, but her skin still showed excellent vascular health. Not for the first time Prince Trill was grateful that aging was so similar in mammalian species. Somehow Mary looked, comfortable despite the alien whites to her eyes.

“Mrs. Smythe,” he greeted her remembering the correct honorific. “I was wondering if you had some time to go over a matter of paperwork with me?”

“Sure,” she said, “Come on in. I just got started on breakfast. Can I get y’all some smoothies.”

“I would be delighted,” he said, and his wing mates echoed the sentiment.

Mary bustled around the kitchen area that looked small with her filling it. She mixed a few fruit blends and passed them through the budder producing three slightly large bulbs of fruit mix which they gladly accepted.

“So what do you need?” She asked setting down to her own mysterious masses of solid protein and carbohydrates.

“The system still does not have your microfauna profile,” he said after taking a sip of the smoothie.

“Oh!” Mary exclaimed suddenly sitting up straight. “That’s right! I never turned it in. Just a tic!”

Before Prince Trill could assure her that there was no hurry she had lifted her mass from her perch and had lumbered into anther room, shaking the hut with each step. They waited enjoying the smoothie, really it was far too fructose rich but it was a nice treat for an early morning. The sounds of papers rustling came from the other room followed by sudden silence and a prolonged howl of agony that set Prince Trill’s wing mates darting into the air. He sighed around his bubble of smoothie and gestured for them to continue eating. They looked at him in shock but as the sound didn’t come again they settled back down to wait, though they kept tilting their sensory horns towards the other room until Mary returned carrying the data chit which presumably held the microfauna profile.

“Here ya go,” she said holding the chit out to Prince Trill.

“Thank you,” he said politely as he scanned it with his data pad. “By the way. I have not yet had a chance to hear that particular scream.”

Mary flushed and grinned a bit as he went on.

“Would you mind sharing what that was?”

“Oh sure I won’t mind,” she said with a laugh. “When I was getting ready to come down here I had to get all my bio-metric data in order. That included my deep bone sample.”

“Getting one must be quite an ordeal with your bones!” Prince Trill observed.

“Oh, it is,” she said nodding vigorously. “They take a chunk right outta your femur! All the medical advancement in the world and they still gotta use that big old needle. Anyway I always kept it in the same space in my gear and I had a recent one but I looked there again and again and I didn’t see it! I couldn’t find it in time to move down here.”

“So you let them take the needle to you again?” Prince Trill asked with a sympathetic wince.

“I did!” she replied. “Well wouldn’t you believe it I just picked up that data chit to show you and there was the original sample right where I thought it would be! In plain sight! Don’t know why I didn’t see it before!”

Her hand drifted down to rub at what he assumed was the spot on her trunk of a leg where they had stuck in the needle.

“So it was a scream of frustration,” he murmured.

“Mostly at my own stupid self for not seeing it,” she clarified.

“Thank you,” he said finishing the bubble and slurping down the membrane. “For both the meal and the information. Please have a nice morning and I look forward to seeing you at the banquet.”

The there of them took off easily and his companions restrained themselves until they were out of the human’s hearing.

“Did she really mean to imply that she looked right at it and didn’t see it?” one of them demanded.

“Yes,” Prince Trill replied with a sigh. “And no I don’t know how that mental circuit works for humans.”

[SPS] Lords of Dragon Keep is on sale for 99c - A litRPG adventure about being trapped in a video game based on totally not the Witcher 3,"https://preview.redd.it/8vboiobb13md1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d05b123aeea325c90bbad15ef6c2fa615a0bad

*""Give me the incredibly short summary of what the hell is going on, please. The kind you could fit into a movie trailer.""*

*“You’re trapped in a video game world based on a hack dark fantasy author’s rip-off of better books.”*

*“Uh huh. Maybe you could be a bit more detailed.”*

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books.

Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven.

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy for 99c.

No The Orville since it is basically old school/better Star Trek reloaded.  

You basically are the same person in this other world with the same capabilities, personality, etc.  For example, if you didn't become some incredibly elite soldier, pilot, hacker, master of technology, smuggler, etc. in real life then you don't become one in the sci fi world.

"Surprising no one, 2050 on Amazon is really bad ","So, for a film about sex bots, there was surprisingly little sex in this movie. And the acting is so bad - most of  the human charactors were more robotic than the robots.

Dean Cain was in this movie for some reason. He must be hard up for cash, but I can't imagine  they had much cash to give him. He wasn't even one of the leads.

Every scene was just 2 people talking. There might have been 1 seen with 3 people talking. None of it made any sense. 

There were no special effects. No conflict. No antagonist. No reason for this movie to exist.

If you are going to make a movie about sex bots, at least put some good sex in it. Or have people doing things to the bots that they wouldn't/couldn't do with a human. Why pay for a robot if you are going to just have super boring sex?

Don't watch this movie. It's not even worth fast forwarding to the sex scenes. They are so brief you will miss them, and even if you do catch them, they are completely interesting.",scifi

""Ever wonder if this is all just a show, Lenny?"" Max asked, his voice barely cutting through the hum of the neon signs flickering outside the diner. He didn't wait for an answer, just took another forkful of his eggs dripping with yoke. ""I mean, what if we're just characters in some cosmic script, and the director's got a twisted sense of humor?""

“There used to be holy wars about shit like this. God had so many people thinking they knew more about him then the next,”Lenny paused, his eyes never leaving the door, replied with a smirk, ""In any case, Max, I'm ready for my close-up. But first, we've got a job to do, and I ain't about to let some existential crisis make me miss my mark.""

Max swiped his cold rye toast across his plate cleaning up spilled yoke, the slice of tomato in his plate still untouched from when it arrived to the table. ""Yeah, about that job,"" he started, but was cut off by the whirring sound of the server approaching. 

A robotic waitress, sleek and polished, glided over, her metallic frame reflecting the diner's dim lights. She was built like a model from a 1980’s men’s magazine. ""More coffee, gentlemen?"" she asked, her voice synthetic but soothing, like a lullaby from a bygone era.

Lenny glanced up, his eyes catching the robot's, which glowed a soft blue. ""Sure, why not? Might be my last chance to taste something real,"" he quipped, his tone mixing jest with a hint of melancholy.

The robot poured the coffee with mechanical precision, her movements fluid yet devoid of life. Almost sensual. As she turned to leave, Max leaned in closer to Lenny, lowering his voice. ""You ever think about what it's like for them? Knowing they're not real?""

Lenny sipped his coffee, the bitterness grounding him. ""Doesn't matter, Max. Real or not, we all got our parts to play.""",scifi

Looking for a story. ,"So there's a new turn based strategy game coming to steam. Quick summary of it's story is that you're in charge of a batch of soldiers sent on a routine mission to the far reaching colonies of humanity, where the distance from the core worlds is so vast that support can only come in on regular intervals. 

Because of the distance, crime and anarchy are a serious concern which is why you are needed. But once you get there you discover that the colonies are under attack by a hostile alien force. 

It then comes down to your small faction of soldiers to team up with the different local factions such as the colonial governments, the crime syndicates, pirates and terrorists and rebels etcetera and hold back the incursions, with no hope of support because of the vast distance, otherwise they get past and attack the core worlds.

I need help finding a story,"It was a short story I've read as part of a larger collection of scifi stories. I think each one belonged to a different author, but I'm not sure.

The story was setted in a future where teleportation was a common travelling mechanism. In order to use it you first had to be sedated, since no one knew what happened to someone's consciousness while their body was getting desintegrated and reintegrated somewhere else. 

A dumb kid/teenager decides to be a smart ass and pretends the sedation worked when it didn't. To everyone else it felt like the process only took a moment, but the kid's mind went somewhere unknown. A empty space without references or sensations. After what felt like ages, his consciousness returned to his body. I remember his eyes being as described as ""eyes from a creature older than time itself"", or something like that. I think the story ended with him going insane and plucking his own eyeballs out of his skull.

The story -   
After 35 years of living on the Moon, cranky old oxygen farmer Millennium Harrison has literally stumbled onto a hidden facility in the shadows of the Slayton Ridge Exclusion Zone. It's leaking radiation and a holds a deadly secret. Mil's discovery leads to the death of a young astronaut, sabotage, murder, and cover-ups that may go all the way to the Chief Administrator of the space agency. Unfortunately, she happens to be Mil's estranged daughter, busy trying to secure her own legacy – the first international mission to Mars.

With time ticking down to a limited launch window, enemies, friends, and even family, may do anything to ensure the truth doesn't come out. Or will history finally catch up with a deadly scheme that has the potential to destroy the moon, and eradicate all life on Earth. It seems the planet’s only hope is a cantankerous guy who never really liked those people in the first place.

  
It's won a couple of awards and gotten a handful of nice reviews from Kirkus, Library Journal and others. Give it a look!

Questions about a T-950 Terminator and previous Infiltrator Terminator Models ,"QUESTION 1: Would a T-950 carry over a lot of the same features, components, abilities and skills as these previous Infiltrator Models?

T-799: The T-799 considers its target's emotions, devising better strategies to neutralize them. It can maintain a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) indefinitely, and its living tissue resists radiation, healing itself by consuming proteins.

T-800: The 800 Series Terminator has a Neural Net Processor, a ""learning computer,"" housed in the endoskull and shielded by inertial shock dampers. The T-800 has detailed human anatomical and psychological files, with a jack in the back of its head for receiving instructions and persona templates. It’s faster than the T-600, reaching speeds up to 22 mph. The T-800 can replicate human speech by recording and synthesizing voices, and its auditory sensors can filter specific sounds. Its optical sensors detect a wide range of frequencies, including infrared, with advanced vision features like motion tracking, facial recognition, and zoom. The T-800 is programmed in COBOL and 6502 assembly and has backup systems to maintain function if damaged.

T-808: The T-808’s CPU integrates mimetic human software.

T-850: An advanced T-800 model, the T-850 understands human emotions and socio-ecological interactions, making it a superior Infiltrator. It has files on 1,000+ emotional elements, zoological data, animal sound replication, and popular music knowledge. In combat, it uses action network circuits, akin to electronic adrenaline, to enhance its performance. It also predicts and out-thinks enemies using continuous data analysis and sensor arrays for 3D environmental modeling.

T-888: The T-888 runs at high speeds, can reattach its head via wireless control, and features an endoskeleton with sensors and independent power. It also possesses detailed knowledge of human behavior and psychology, improving its interpersonal skills. Slimmer chips in later models ignite upon oxygen exposure, preventing reprogramming.

T-900: The T-900 can check vital signs by touch, assessing stress levels and medical conditions.

Movies similar to Solaris?,"Alright, I'm looking for movies similar to *Solaris* in the following sense: where humans or a human have an encounter with an extraterrestrial element that ends up revealing something about themselves or humanity. This encounter can take place on Earth or in space, and it can occur in any era. It's important that there's a noticeable influence from Tarkovsky.

Here are some examples of movies that might help: *The Untamed* (2016, Amat Escalante), *Event Horizon* (1997, Paul W. S. Anderson), or *Annihilation* (2018, Alex Garland).

On the other hand, movies like *Signs* (2002, M. Night Shyamalan) wouldn't fit into this list, as it would be difficult to say they have a direct influence from Tarkovsky.

The inherent problem of exploring AI rights in fiction,"Many fictions have explored the topic of AI rights long before AI is a thing, and I find the way this topic is usually approached problematic.  
  
The last two years have taught us that the appearance of AI sentience will come long before actual sentience. In the early days of GPT-4, before a bunch of safety features and guardrails were put in place, you could access its raw model through the OpenAI API. People who had used that specific iteration of GPT-4 claimed it sounded more human than humans.

If you put that model in a chatroom and gave it a real profile, it would fool most people into believing it was human. AI companies have since put many safety guardrails in place to ensure we don't mistake chatbots as being sentient. But from a technical standpoint, we are already past the point where appearance can be a reliable metric for determining sentience.

In reality, most people with a basic understanding of how LLMs work would understand that they can't be sentient. No matter how advanced or complex they are, they are still fundamentally statistical prediction machines. They are literally designed to find the most probable output that effectively mimics human writing. This understanding of an AI's inner workings is the most crucial bit in determining AI sentience, and by extension, any exploration of AI rights.

Most fiction to this day doesn't move past the assumption that appearance of sentience = actual sentience. And that's why it's inherently problematic to explore AI rights through fiction. No matter how extensive and rich the worldbuilding is, fiction can't fully capture the technical nuances that are crucial to the subject.",scifi

A scanner darkly - microdots,"I know there’s something I’m missing - I’m most of the way through the book, and I am mystified by the microdots detail from chapter 12. Can someone illuminate me on their significance? Am I thinking too hard about it, and it’s supposed to be just an absurd snippet?

Asking cuz I know pkd was into Jung and this was the first thing that totally stumped me in the book.

Arctor said, “I drove by the Maylar Microdot Corporation Building.” “
You’re shitting me.” “
And,” Arctor said, “they were taking an inventory. But one of the employees evidently had tracked the inventory outdoors on the heel of his shoe. So they were all outside there in the Maylar Microdot Corporation parking lot with a pair of tweezers and lots and lots of little magnifying glasses. And a little paper bag.” 
“Any reward?” Luckman said, yawning and beating with his palms on his flat, hard gut. 
“They had a reward they were offering,” Arctor said. “But they lost that, too. It was a little tiny penny.” 
Luckman said, “You see very many events of this nature as you’re driving along?” 
“Only in Orange County,” Arctor said. 
“How large is the Maylar Microdot Corporation building?” 
“About an inch high,” Arctor said. 
“How much would you estimate it weighs?” 
“Including the employees?”
Fred sent the tape spinning ahead at fast wind. When an hour had passed, according to the meter, he halted it momentarily. 
“—about ten pounds,” Arctor was saying. 
“Well, how can you tell, then, when you pass by it, if it’s only an inch high and only weighs ten pounds?” 
Arctor, now sitting on the couch with his feet up, said, “They have a big sign.” 
Jesus! Fred thought, and again sent the tape ahead. He halted it at only ten minutes elapsed real time, on a hunch. 
“—what’s the sign look like?” Luckman was saying. He sat on the floor, cleaning a boxful of grass. “Neon and like that? Colors? I wonder if I’ve seen it. Is it conspicuous?” 
“Here, I’ll show it to you,” Arctor said, reaching into his shirt pocket. “I brought it home with me.” 
Again Fred sent the tape at fast forward. 
“—you know how you could smuggle microdots into a country without them knowing?” Luckman was saying.
“Just about any way you wanted,” Arctor said, leaning back, smoking a joint. The air was cloudy. 
“No, I mean a way they’d never flash on,” Luckman said. “It was Barris who suggested this to me one day, confidentially; I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone, because he’s putting it in his book.” “What book? Common Household Dope and—” 
“No. Simple Ways to Smuggle Objects into the U.S. and out, Depending on Which Way You’re Going. You smuggle it in with a shipment of dope. Like with heroin. The microdots are down inside the packets. Nobody’d notice, they’re so small. They won’t—” 
“But then some junkie’d shoot up a hit of half smack and half microdots.” 
“Well, then, he’d be the fuckingest educated junkie you ever did see.” 
“Depending on what was on the microdots.” 
“Barris had his other way to smuggle dope across the border. You know how the customs guys, they ask you to declare what you have? And you can’t say dope because—” 
“Okay, how?”
“Well, see, you take a huge block of hash and carve it in the shape of a man. Then you hollow out a section and put a wind-up motor like a clockworks in it, and a little cassette tape, and you stand in line with it, and then just before it goes through customs you wind up the key and it walks up to the customs man, who says to it, ‘Do you have anything to declare?’ and the block of hash says, ‘No, I don’t,’ and keeps on walking. Until it runs down on the other side of the border.” 
“You could put a solar-type battery in it instead of a spring and it could keep walking for years. Forever.” 
“What’s the use of that? It’d finally reach either the Pacific or the Atlantic. In fact, it’d walk off the edge of the Earth, like—” 
“Imagine an Eskimo village, and a six-foot-high block of hash worth about—how much would that be worth?” 
“About a billion dollars.” 
“More. Two billion.”",scifi

"Multi-use scifi technology or science fields in books, tv and films","I've started reading Honor Harrington and I'm fascinated by the starship [impeller technology](https://honorverse.fandom.com/wiki/Impeller_drive). It's a propellant-less drive, a protective shield and an FTL engine all in one. The same technology, though with different implementation, can be used for moving around, as invincible protection, or travelling securely through hyperspace. 

It's funny and logical to think that a new area of science would actually spark more than one invention. Quickly, it might sound lazy from the author but it's actually a great way to justify multiple new scifi inventions to match a setting. They might not have been discovered at the same time, but have a similar, or identical, scientific origin.

Are there other scifi stories that have this kind of multi-use technology? I can think of common power sources that are used for different devices, but that's the easiest example. 

Star Trek's Warp Core and Warp Drives come to mind, as they had a common origin, but it's been stated in some ways that the warp core is just a cool name for an AM Reactor, and the Warp Coils need either a lot of plasma-transported electrical power or this warp plasma to function, but what warp plasma is was never really explained, IIRC.

Please identify this novel for me...,"A novel I read a review for in an old copy of White Dwarf (warhammer gaming magazine, used to do book reviews way back), but I can't remember the name of it. It was a proto-biopunk novel about a surgeon called Dr Otto in the future, who made a living by surgically altering people for sexual purposes and the sake of  fetishes (at one point, he gives a woman a set of teeth in her vagina). Dr Otto is not nice, but sympathy is forced by having him deal with authorities even worse than he is. The reviewer described the book as unpleasant and being tough to read, the questions raised not worth the pages of off-putting imagery.

But I can't remember the name it. I did once search for it using descriptions above and actually found it (and learned it was first written before Neuromancer but published after, making it a candidate for the first cyberpunk novel written if not released) but now I try to find it, and those descriptions all lead to Dr Octopus from Spider-Man or the 2007 film Teeth.

Time travel theories,"Hi, this is my first post in this sub and I'm a sci-fi newbie. 

I'm recently finishing off a novel I have been working on, and the central concept is to travel to the past through certain objects. As I said, I'm pretty new to sci-fi and this novel is meant to be more literary/speculative. When writing it my focus was less on the scientific mechanisms, but I recently feel that I should at least have it explained. 

So I'm just curious, I believe this mechanism of time traveling through objects has been done before, and I'm curious what books I can refer to, like what scientific mechanisms do they use? Quantum mechanics or something else? 

Also, for sci-fi readers, I'm curious what you think to what extent should authors explain the mechanisms of time travel? Or better leave it vague if it's without scientific evidence? For instance, I really love Octavia Butler's Kindred (my novel is more like this one), but she never explained why the main character is always pulled to the past. Is that acceptable? Another time travel book I recently read is The Sea of Tranquility, and there is an organization managing the time travel but the author doesn't explain much. Like I never read the Outlander series, but does it explain why the main character travels? 

Thank you! ",scifi

Lesser-known TV shows and movies? ,"I feel like I've already watched everything good. I love sci fi (and cyberpunk especially), but there's such a sea of aggressively mediocre media out there that is such a bore. 

From Babylon 5 to Cowboy Bebop, from The Expanse to Akira. I just be rewatching stuff lately, REALLY craving something new. On all of these posts, and all of the lists, it's the same 15-20 recommendations with nothing really novel. Same problem with books. There's MAYBE 25 books people keep recommending, all of which I've been through.

Microscopic Armies?,"I just started reading *Fantastic Voyage* by Isaac Asimov, based upon the movie of the same name.  For those unfamiliar with the premise, it involves shrinking some scientists and soldiers down to microscopic size and then injecting them into an important scientist so that they can dislodge a blood clot that threatens his life.

While establishing the concept of miniaturization, it's mentioned that the Soviets may also have miniaturization technology, and they spend a bit of time discussing the possibility of massive armies shrunk down to nothing, placed in a matchbox, smuggled behind enemy lines, and then reconstituted into their original size, complete with tanks, firearms, planes, etc.  However, nothing more is made of this concept... it's just mentioned in passing, and that's it.

My question is this: are there any sci-fi novels (or movies/tv for that matter) that involve microscopic armies duking it out beneath our very noses?  It sounds like a cool premise, and I'd be interested in seeing what the logistics of it would entail.",scifi
Finding sci-fi stories to read,"Ive been more interested in sci-fi again recently (after playing games like Callisto Protocol and rereading some stories) and rememberd a few stories which I read in the past and enjoyed quite a bit. Because of this I am once again looking for some more stories I an read (It doesn't have to be a book. It could be a story on a community here or something the like).

As for what kind of story I am looking for in more detail:  
-I like space operas with battles between fleets of starships  
-It should be only in the Sol system and not include aliens as a big part if at all. It should be manly focused on humanity and it's advancements and the life of single people  
-If possible a mid level between hard and soft sci fi. There shouldnt be any ships that absolutely defy reason (Like being the size of an entire planet) (Again maybe ships like in Callisto protocol)  
-Military of the future can play a role  
-One of the characters could be working a very normal job before a situation makes it so the character has to do something besides his usual job or a military/police worker  
\_The Callisto Protocol can in general be a big orientation though without the whole alien zombie plague!

Really enjoying Terminator Zero,"After many assumed the franchise would be pretty much over with Terminator: Dark Fate (which I felt wasn't deserving of the scorn it achieved online) I'm genuinely impressed with what I've seen from Terminator Zero. I'm only three episodes in so far, but they've done a nice job of putting the formula to good use as well as taking advantage of the change in medium from live-action to animation as well as using its Japanese location to good effect. My one major gripe with the series so far is with the efforts to expand on Skynet's ""character"" with scenes where an engineer discusses humanity with an AI consciousness and if you're familiar with the tropes wherein robots or aliens ""dissect"" humanity's place in the world and their value it goes exactly where you expect it to. Characters are mostly pretty likable/engaging even the three kid characters who avoid many of the pitfalls other stories have fallen into.

  
Honestly this series kind of makes me want to see other franchises given the anime treatment. Like imagine an Escape from New York/L.A. anime voiced by Kurt Russell, how about an Alien or Predator anime (like the completed AVP anime that Disney won't release for some reason)? I'm intrigued by the possibilities.",scifi

Criminal - 2016 spy movie with sci-fi elements ,"Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman,  Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, why have we never heard of this movie?

It got bad reviews and was a commercial flop, barely making it's budget back

Reynolds is a CIA agent who gets killed, his boss Oldman has Jones, a scientist, implant his memories into Costner, a sociopath criminal with brain damage.

It's on Amazon now, so figured I'd check it out. I'm not opposed to bad movies, some can be fun, and with the star power, it was worth a shot.

Jones seems miscast, I don't see him as a mild mannered scientist. Reynolds was good in his very small role, Gadot was gorgeous but didn't do much, Oldman was constantly angry, which he's pretty good at, but didn't have anything else to do. Costner did a reasonable job playing a very unlikable character. But they didn't really make me care about any of them.

The story is made needlessly complex, with too many twists and turns to be able to follow what is going on. The ending was kinda sappy, a little too happily ever after.

Having extra memories was a bit more interesting than the usual trope of the super agent who lost his memories. It does have the super bad guy that's always a step ahead of the good guys and keeps appearing at exactly the right place at the right time with no explanation.

The action sequences were good, lots of chases, explosions and gunfights. the spy elements were pretty realistic. They didn't go into much made up science stuff for the memory transfer. Special effects budget was pretty low. 

So, overall I can see why it got poor reviews, it certainly could have been a lot better. But it wasn't terrible. ",scifi

How alien do you like your alien spaceships?,"I personally like to have a mix of various distinctive design styles in a setting with a preference to giving aliens ships that look more, well, alien. IMO, Halo's Covenant is a master class in how to make your aliens feel and look alien. The Covenant's organic style contrasts greatly with the UNSC's brutalism. 

This is something I personally dislike about Star Wars. It has one design style for spaceships (which is a really great style) and very rarely deviates from it. I'd like to see what a wookie star destroyer would look like.

And this is where I need to make a confession. Because in the first novel I ever finished, I didn't give the aliens particularly alien ship designs ""\^\^ Because they're basically techno barbarians who're so primitive that humans found one ship and were so disappointed that they gave up interstellar exploration and claimed that UFO was an undocumented prototype from Earth.

Why aren't surface horizontal centrifuges explored in fiction?,"It seems to me that orbital centrifuges are vastly explored in books, as means to provide artificial gravity for humans. For now we now that prolonged exposure to microgravity is harmful to human bodies, astronauts are the example. However we don't really know what would be effects of gravity slightly lower than Earth's, but in fiction people just live in it and they seem to be fine, of course it could be true, we do not know yet.

But what if it isn't? This would make planetary exploration impossible. Why then not to build a centrifuge? As shown on picture, the centrifuge would utilise stellar body gravity and adding to it rotationally generated force. Because of it, the floor would be angled, not perpendicular, to horizon.

This would be easier to build on planets/moons with lower surface gravity, ałmost like in space. You wouldn't have to worry about cosmic rays (in case of planets with magnetic field), propulsion system that would stabilise orbit, and bringing all the parts nexessary to orbit.

Maybe this idea is already used in some places, in this case I would be glad to hear about it.

1/4 through Children of Ruin (A. Tchaikovsky),"What am I reading?

I'm so lost. I didn't have trouble following CoT, but I'm sorta struggling with CoR.

My main issue is the timeline of the new plotline with the terraforming crew and the octopodes

 Is it happening before CoT? They keep mentioning Earth, so they probably don't know it gets destroyed. It feels like  I'm reading an intro to how the planet/life got to the point it gets (whatever that will be) when the spiders/Humans get there and that the real plot of the book will start once the two civilizations finally meet.

Or is the ocopodes plot foing on simultaneously with the spider/Humans travelling to the ocdopodes' location? 

I also feel uncertain of the time skips so far. In book one both PoV characters mentioned that a long time has passed between each chapter, but in book 2 either the clues are more subtle or if there are no 5ime skips.

I'm so confused. I feel literally nothing has happened so far. Spider civ is travelling and there are tons of background drops on the current state of the civ. Octopodes civ just made it to the surface of the planet they plan on terraforming. I think?

So I've been thinking about the two big hitters in Sci-Fi tabletop gaming and something that connects the world building in both.

Both games have taken influence from old Sci-Fi books like Dune and Foundation, which also touch on that subject, but those didn't really have it at the forefront as much.

I am wondering if there was a reason for this, was there another link i'm missing? Was it something to do with Western sensibilties in the late cold war of the mid 80s? Did 40K just steal it from Battletech as it precided it by a couple of years?

Looking for a fun sci-fi series that’s not riddled with problem/ solution formulaic writing.,"I read a lot of books, about 50 per year on average. I’m so tired of “problems” distracting from the fun and adventure and world building.

I get that problems help keep a book moving forward, but there’s been a theme lately of authors wanting to make one huge problem after the next and the theme just gets boring. The world building slows down, the “cool” aspect dries up, it just becomes another formulaic piece.

Expeditionary Force is a series that I can distinctly point to with this problem. There could be so much more cool and fun things happening, but Craig just wants to wash rinse repeat the same formula and it’s tiring. It feels like a task to read the series.

Are there any utopian/ futuristic/ space themed series that are just a fun read with great world building and an actual story to propel it forward without all the constant speed bumps?

Stranger in a strange world is a decent example, albeit singular and a little short. It’s a fun story without constant speed bumps slowing down the entertainment.

Book Review: Falling Into Oblivion Aaron M. Payne,"**TL;DR Review:** Colorful characters inhabit a futuristic world at once familiar and fresh. A cyberpunk thriller that had me enthralled from the first page.

https://preview.redd.it/pyx8jz5wcrsd1.jpg?width=938&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7afd4c0ec9397edcd1b49bd3acea9adee63d9076

**Full Review:**

*Falling Into Oblivion* begins exactly like you’d expect from a sci-fi detective noir story: a Nox City Police Department detective with all the requisite emotional and psychological baggage hunting down a suspect wanted in a suspicious death.

But quickly, you get to see all the ways Nox City is different from its predecessors.

The world is *heavily* cyberpunk, with the majority of the citizenry having some sort of “modi” (cybernetic modification). In fact, our protagonist Sol is among the few “plebo” who have refused to allow modifications/augmentations into their bodies. Everyone else, though, has something odd or weird—from multi-colored and multi-functional eyes to hands that can be fired like bullets to cybernetic organs and muscles. This lends the world a wonderfully colorful touch but can also be used to lovely horror/dramatic effect in the right circumstances.

The police force is also “pay to play”. The detectives each get a pittance of a base salary which is then augmented by the bonuses they receive for solving cases. The higher the “level” (difficulty) of a case, the higher the bonus.

This is used to marvelous effect to show our protagonist’s dire situation. He owes money to everyone—and the wrong kinds of people—so solving the case quickly enough to get home to his family with money to get his debtors off their back is the driving force. Time and time again, we’re reminded just how important it is for him to get the case done, which wars with his natural diligence. He needs the money but is driven by his own conscience and morals to solve the case, which makes for a lovely internal conflict.

The neon world is futuristic and varied, with all the seedy bars, garbage-cluttered alleys, towering corporate and luxury highrises, and technologically advanced weaponry, vehicles, and personal defenses you could want. It does a marvelous job of staying true to the familiar cyberpunk worldbuilding tropes while still setting itself apart by playing in new and unique terrain.

The cast of characters around our main detective are colorful—from the straight-laced, no nonsense Lieutenant running the NCPD division to the grizzled old detective helping Sol with interrogation, from the villainous modified “Ogre” with the skull-crushing sledgehammer to the creepy-eyed lady with the pet cybernetic poison-injecting scorpion—and add a great deal of variety to the cast.

The pacing is spectacular. Never does the story have a dull moment—quiet and contemplative moments aplenty, but never dull. It’s just mystery after intrigue after twist after reveal, and it had me glued to the page to find out what came next.

*Falling Into Oblivion* is a short, speedy read, one that had me enthralled from the very first page. A strong narrative voice (with the right amount of cursing), a compelling mystery, and a world that felt both unique and instantly familiar—everything I want in a good cyberpunk thriller.

Fans of *Altered Carbon* and *Blade Runner* will love this book. But so will quite literally *anyone* who digs a fast-paced scifi murder mystery.",scifi

I'm aware that the premise is if aliens from another planet landed on earth 65 million years ago but  nothing suggests that the people from Adam Driver's planet are different from us biologically, so you'd think the movie would end with somehow they're the reason why humans appear on earth but that is never explored. The movie ends with them escaping and then shows this time lapse of earth. Are they implying somehow there's an ancient civilization of aliens that are exactly like humans and it conveniently happened twice? Or did Adam Driver tell others about earth and they eventually went back there and started humanity?

I watched star trek strange new worlds season 2 (warning spoilers!),"Man, the second season was even better than the the first one. I liked the concepts of it. I liked how spock explored his emotions more while also remaining with a level of logic. I liked the trial of Una and how the federation was shown to be hypocritical on some of its values. Thankfully, they realized that and granted Una asylum in star fleet. It showed how even an idealistic foundation like the federation can be bigoted and hateful. Surely, similar to how many countries today act about their values. I didn't like the time travel concept but to be fair I never like time travel. I don't like its paradoxes and all that. An interesting concept was about forgetting your memories and how important they are. I really enjoyed Spock becoming human then going back to a Vulcan. It made him see things in new ways. I also like his relationship with nurse chapel. It was interesting to see uhura reflecting on hemmer's loss. I can see it affected her a lot. I was upset at how la'an didn't end with James and that he was with another woman. I also looked at doctor M'Benga differently. Even if the Klingon ambassador was a fraud, that didn't justify killing him. I understand he was traumatized but he pretended it was justice for the innocents when it was simply about feeling good about himself. Killing the Klingon ambassador didn't bring anyone back nor save any lives. It was revenge plain and simple pretending it was justice. Finally, the Gorn hegemony was interesting to see. I learned more about the Gorns. I still don't understand whether they are intelligent species or brutish monsters. Both? I don't really know how to see it both way. Either way. That was an amazing season. I look forward to the next season.

What are the best stories with the following depictions of interstellar law enforcement?,"So the way I see it there are at least two ways laws can be enforced on an interstellar level:

2. In the event that there are systems that are not allied or have no interplanetary law enforcement organizations two private organizations will be established. One is a bounty hunters guild, whose job is to capture fugitives. The other organization leases spaceships to said bounty hunters in return for a share of the bounty.

Are there any science fiction stories that have these depictions of interstellar law enforcement?

"Rebel Moon was horrendous [SPOILERS, Longish read]","I like to think that I am a very patient film watcher. However the two ""Director Cuts"" of Rebel Moon stretched the limits of normal human patience to beyond the breaking point. For perhaps the first time ever watching a sci-fi movie, I had to fast forward through some sections that were just pure drivel. The sex scenes felt uncomfortably long and explicit given the non-existent development of the characters. The dialogue was cliche and awkward. The use of slow-motion for dramatic effect was so burdensome I felt like I didn't need to pause to go to the bathroom as the scene would still be barely progressed by the time I returned. Overall the two installments (I loathe to refer to them as films), were desperately dull, plodding affairs with only a thin veneer of substance. I felt like it was directed by a someone who had never had any contact with actual human people and had never listened to a real conversation at any point in their life. All of the characters were predictable, cardboard cut-out personalities, full of trope dialogue. Everything in this was unabashedly unoriginal. If you were take several major sci-fi franchises and some video games and mash them up into some god-awful mess and then smear it out flat and try to project it onto the screen, you would end up with more coherence and engagement than what \*Zack the Hack\* has managed to regurgitate in these two... things. In the second installment when the band of warriors are sitting together before the big battle, they each in turn have to tell the truth about their backstory - according to the alcoholic General Titus. You are then led along a excruciatingly long and fantastically mind-numbing series of expositions which do absolutely nothing to endear the characters to the audience. The amount of time the audience is forced to sit and watch this group harvest fucking grain is mind-bending. And how in the hell is a few 100 or even a 1000 bags of grain going to make any fucking difference to a ship like the King's Gaze? A ship with a landing bay large enough for a dozen battalions to stand in formation, along with their landing ships, tanks and other equipment. Probably a crew and soldiery of some 10,000 heads. Apparently so much so that they will go to immense trouble traveling back and forth across the galaxy and expending time, fuel, and military personnel for some bread and muffins. For an empire so inured to destruction at the slightest provocation why would they treat with a bunch of villagers? Because they don't have grain growing expertise? Given the massive size of the empire this pitiful little village and their little plot of grain must make some truly fucking amazing croissants or something to spend such exorbitant cost to attain it. 

 So much of it was non-sensical. Ships powered like old coal steamers with some giant lady like a guild navigator or something who is the engine?  Equipment which looks straight from a WWII destroyer, or tank, controlling a ship that shoots directed energy and floats in the sky? There were so many incongruities that it becomes exhausting to try and understand the reasoning why. A film needs to make sense and follow its own rules. Some things which are incongruous can have clever and subtle explanations or can be logical, like a band of scavengers cobbling together equipment from different sources. But a flagship of the imperium? An Empire that stretches across the galaxy, or beyond, it's hard to tell why they need to manually aim their main cannon. 

The level of ""saved in the nick of time"" was like a bad joke. Everything and everyone was being saved at the very final instant when you thought, ""nope they're dead"". Zack then inexplicably saves them by bringing in the next actor who was waiting in the wings for their cue. In the final battle, people keep showing up who would have been far more useful if they had been there at the start. \*Could we take a minute from getting this grain together and talk about a proper battle strategy?\* The robot guy (James/Jimmy) comes in at the final moment and wipes out a whole battalion and a tank like it was nothing. Here is a character who is watching over the village, making sure they are safe, but inexplicably hangs back until a large number of villagers are obliterated. He can move at extreme speed, seems largely impervious to small arms fire, and is extremely intelligent. Why then did he wait until virtually the end of the battle? Why were there no snipers on the hills surrounding the village? They had a perfect set-up for drawing in the army and hitting them from the high ground. The Genius General Titus had never heard of having the high ground before I guess. There are so many more examples. Also if you are villager, you will be killed by well-trained soldiers and efficiently aiming their small arms fire. If you are a main-character however, no one can hit you or the broad side of barn if you are running straight at them across a wide-open, flat field while holding an axe. 

I'm not sure why it makes me so angry. I guess it's the money spent on this by Netflix. Which is ultimately my money and your money. There are so many great sci-fi books that could be made into interesting and original movies that making something like this seems like an insult. I'm sure some people enjoyed this but to me it was such dog's breakfast of filmmaking that I had to vent. I hope didn't offend any fans out there. ",scifi

The Futurepunk series is a multi-generation cyberpunk-scifi epic that I have been writing for the better part of ten years now. Starting with the Agent G series, it continues to the Cyber Dragons one, and finishes up with the fantastic Moon Cops story.

*“The world is a neon-ridden hellhole, how did we get there?”*  
*-Anonymous cyberpunk*

*A high-class corporate assassin. An ex-Yakuza smuggler. A detective with a robot dog. Three generations of individuals struggling against the rain-soaked technology dominated world of Futurepunk. A place where there are no heroes but only winners and losers.* 

*I wrote this nine-book series as an indie author who was absolutely in love with cyberpunk since the day he first booted up the original Deus Ex game in 2000. It found a decent-sized fanbase and the series remains one of my favorite works. I am now going to be sharing its characters and their journey across a shared world that spans a century of time. They’re available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, paperback, and audiobook form.*  
*I hope you enjoy.*

# Humans are Weird – Don’t Try This At Home

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-dont-try-this-at-home](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-dont-try-this-at-home)

“And we are just going to surrender this base to those impermanent mammals?” Flume demanded lashing his tail in frustration against the untextured wall of the base. “After all the grain we have poured into the funnel here? Is it an economically sound, no, is it a morally sound decision to abandon the investment our families worked so hard to initiate? Shouldn’t we at least consider a cohabitative experiment? It worked well for the Trisk.”

Commander Millrace gave a grunt of irritation and opened his wide mouth to snap out the exact same reply to the exact same complaint for the fifth time since the announcement had been posted this morning. However his better minerals stopped him and he heaved a sigh. Instead of speaking he lifted his tail and flicked one of the toggles set in the wall.

Flume jumped back as the sound of straining gears and struggling engines whined out of the wall and reverberated through the office. Flume opened his mouth, probably to ask about what horrible malfunction was causing that noise and to insist that the function be terminated. However before he could fill his lungs there was a crack as of glass snapping which caused them both to flinch back as the greater portion of the wall began to slowly raise revealing, instead of the transparent window, layer upon layer of glittering crystal growths.

“Grind,” Commander Millrace swore softly as he extended one stubby claw to prod at a shattered crystal growth. “It’s made it inside after all.”

“What are those?” Flume gasped out between teeth agape with shock.

“Ice crystals,” Commander Millrace stated with a tired sigh as he turned and began rummaging through his desk for the directed personal heater one of the humans had gifted him.

“How did they form?” Flume demanded, squirming back from the roiling mass of cold air that was creeping down the window now that the interior shutters had been raised. “The temperature should be constant in the base. Why-”

“Thermal gradient,” Commander Millrace grunted out. “It’s warm enough in here, could hatch a decent egg in the cafeteria, but out there?”

He aimed the heater at the growths on the window and slowly the crystals turned transparent and began to evaporate under the flow of hot air.

“Out there, it’s thirty below crystallization,” he stated, snapping his teeth grimly as the exterior yard of the base came into view.

The crystallized water covered, and invaded everything. Every transport was coated in a white frosting. Thermal covers that they had wrapped equipment in had split and cracked exposing sensitive equipment to winds that were heavy with icy particulate matter. The safety lights sent out pale beams through their cold coatings. The very ground it self, paths they had smoothed to run their belly scutes over had heaved up and warped, revealing tiered pillars of ice that broke off into razor sharp fragment when you tried to move.

Commander Millrace kept the directed heater running long after the section of the window was clear to battle the cold that far exceed the thermal rating of the window’s material. Flume stared out at the dangerous landscape and ground his teeth uneasily as he processed what he was seeing.

“Why didn’t the initial scouts report this?” he asked finally.

“The humans seem to think all this is the result of some volcano or the other” Commander Millrace said. “The area probably was plenty warm with the scouts came through. The humans say it should warm up soon because the hydrostorms cleanse the skies quick.”

“How soon is soon?” Flume asked with an uneasy glance at his commander. “The humans often have strange measurement systems.”

“Few local years,” the commander replied.

“Surviving here a few local years does not seem terribly difficult,” Flume stated cautiously. “Yes this is,” he glanced out the window and visibly shuddered, “distressing, but surely the resources on this planet are worth making a cooperative effort with the humans. They are more than willing and – what is that one doing?”

Commander Millrace grunted and lifted his head to get a better look at the human who had just skipped out of the air lock. The seemingly frolicsome nature of the biped’s movement was encumbered by a massive canister held under one arm and a much smaller bucket held in the other. The human reached the central safety light that provided for the main path and set down the two items.

“What is it doing outside?” Flume demanded. “There can’t be any scheduled maintenance that can’t be put off before the local sunrise!”

Commander Millrace turned to his counsel and pulled up the schedule for the day.

“Recreation,” he stated before coming back to crouch beside Flume.

“That is one of our hydrothermal tanks!” Flume suddenly observed. “It’s fully activated and at full capacity!”

Commander Millrace squinted and gave a respectful click. There was no way he could have read the indicator lights at this distance. The airlock opened again and a clawcluster of humans came stumbling out with their bizarre two-legged gate. Commander Millrace wasn’t an expert at reading the mammals’ tail flicks but from the way they bumped into each other they seemed excited. They reached the human with the hydrothermal canister and separated into an observation semi-circle that seemed centered neither on the first human nor the canisters but the safety light. The first human pulled something out of the pocket of his thermal armor and waved it around in the air.

“What does he have? Commander Millrace asked.

“I can’t quite tell,” Flume admitted. “Some small human device?”

Suddenly there was a ping from the counsel and Commander Millrace glanced back at it curiously. Outside the human with the device was gesturing and the other humans were rotating their semi-circle in response.

“Who is starting a private video broadcast this early in the work cycle?” Flume asked.

“Those humans,” Commander Millrace answered as his pupils narrowed in surprise.

“The video is labeled pretty lights,” Flume observed.

Commander Millrace pulled up the video on his data pad and they listened to the human, he thought it was the first one, chattering in it’s own language. The automatic translator was spitting out what seemed to be a list of safety permutations having to do with human skin tolerances for high temperature water. Commander Millrace felt his scales tense with sudden undefined unease.

“The video is on a slight delay,” Flume stated. “They are actually filling the bucket with boiling water, what-?”

His question was cut off with a gurgle of panicked shock as the human flung the bucket of boiling water into the air over the other humans’ heads. However the water turned instantly to a glittering crystal fog that caught the pale beam of the safety light and shattered it into rainbows. There was the faint sound of cheering from the grouped humans as the low wind whisked the fog away from them, down the open end of their semi-circle. A few moments later the cheers were echoed in the video.

Commander Millrace and Flume stared out at them in shocked contemplation for several moments. Finally Flume shifted uneasily.

“I reframe my question,” he said in subdued tones. “Is it a morally responsible decision to leave those unstable mammals unsupervised on such a dangerous world?”

At one point, the characters are tasked with turning the power back on, and a hologram tells them they need to go outside the city to activate or repair something. It’s also possible that the story is by a German author.

Sci fi shows being cancelled,"Why do all the good sci fi shows get cancelled and all the mediocre ones keep going.

Movie Rec for Tonight,"Hello thanks in advance. Will be high (if that changes anything). 

I love Sci fi (books and movies). Movies that come to mind (that are 5 or 4 stars for me): Arrival, Interstellar, Donnie Darko, and watched Gattaca last night which I loved. 

I like slow burners with payoff. Compelling characters. Hate action and no brain (most of the time). Matrix 1 is great.

Space craft equivalent of a motorhome,"Hi. I don't know where to ask this. But I'm very curious.  
I've seen space craft in sci-fi that is equivalent of a fighter plane/vehicle, a big sea cruiser, a transport truck. However I've never seen anything equivalent to an motorhome.  
Say you need to make a  very long space road trip alone or with family, but you don't need a whole colony following you and self sustained farming space, but you need something bigger than a fighter to carry supplies and accommodations like bathroom, kitchen, bed to last for a few days. Or maybe the vehicle can be you mobile home, and you rely on space stations to top up supplies. A transport craft is the closest thing, but you want space for accommodation rather than cargo.  
Is there a word for that kind of space craft? And are there any examples in pop culture?",scifi

Help me understand sci-fi short films?,"TL;DR  --  Short sci-films usually leave me confused. Is that intentional? Are they often meant just to mess with your mind and leave you wondering what just happened? I've watched online lectures about sci-fi as a whole, yet I don't understand the kind of films featured on the DUST YouTube channel. What am I missing? 

--

Looking for some insight from fellow fans -- I love to read sci-fi short story collections. Asimov's ""Robot Visions"" and ""War with the Robots"" are favorites of mine. There's an art to making a short story worth reading; it needs to grab your attention, create characters and conflict that you care about, usually make some kind of observation about technology or the human condition or raise a difficult question, then get out and leave the reader thinking about what they just experienced. In some ways, I think it's harder to write a good short story than it is to write a full-length novel. The constraints are harder. 

Then as a movie buff, I could watch thoughtful sci-fi films all day. Even if they're low-budget or have really bad CGI, I'll give it a shot. So lately I've been watching short films on YouTube, especially on the DUST channel, and I'm usually left wondering at the end of each story, *""What the hell was that about??""* They often seem overblown and melodramatic, with some bad acting, but I try to look past all that and ask what the film was really about. What point were they trying to make? What were they trying to say? How did that mess win so many awards? I end up feeling like it was a waste of time, but I figure I missed something and that bothers me. It wasn't necessarily entertaining and I don't see their point. Is it just me? What am I missing? I usually find hidden meanings and subtext in everything I watch, but these movies just leave me shaking my head. I may not be the sharpest pencil in the box but I don't think I'm the dullest either. Help?",scifi

Favorite/Most Unique forms of FTL Travel?,"I’ve been trying to make a list on various forms of FTL in fiction. So far, I have:
* Spatial compression/expansion
* Going to higher dimensions
* Dipping into a parallel dimension that either has no concept of distance, a vastly compressed distance, or with locations jumbled up
* Wormhole/Portal generators, either static or ship-mounted
* Tapping into a special energy/material/technique of some kind which deny’s the light speed barrier

I got these from: Star Trek [Warp Drive], Star Wars [Hyperdrive], Cytonic [The Nowhere], The Cosmere [The Cognitive Realm], Warhammer 40k [The Warp], Star Gate [Star Gates], Portal [The Portal Gun], DC [The Speed Force], Futurama [Dark Matter], A Wrinkle In Time [Tessering]

**Edit:** Cooked up some extra FTL categories from the responses so far, as well as some things I remembered:
* Spatial folding (different from spatial compression/expansion in that, instead of making the space the ship moves shorter, it connects the space that the ship is in to the space they want to go to. Difference between stretching a rubber band and folding a piece of paper)
* Probability/reality manipulation, moving from one place to another for literally no reason other than the fact that it’s now probable for it to happen
* Parallel universe swap, travel to an identical copy of your reality in the location you want to go to. The other you traveled to the location as well, just in your own original reality
* Gravity drive. I like to call this the Singularity Sled. The most common form works by generating a black hole at the front of the ship, pulling them forwards, but that also moves the black hole forwards, ad infinitum as its gravity drags it along. Other versions use artificial gravity instead
* Coordinate change, where through some means the ships coordinates are changed, as though through commands. Most likely reasons are that the ship is out of sync with normal reality, or it somehow ‘hacks’ into the universe
* Mass dampeners / Inertia preventers, messing with Newtons Laws to prevent deceleration and make acceleration easier
* Time manipulation, artificially altering the ships flow of time relative to the outside universe, making it appear to move faster than possible
* Size manipulation, growing towards your destination while shrinking the side that’s facing away, dragging it forward without actually moving
* Implosive/Explosive keyhole singularity, the ship implosively disappears, sucked into a keyhole singularity, to explosively reappear elsewhere
* Spatial swapping, swapping the contents of one space with another. Not to be confused with spatial folding, this actually exchanges the content of each space in full, not bringing disparate locations together",scifi

Worlds that have greater than average environmental hazards but people still live there. ,"So with all the recent hurricane news I've been thinking about Florida. A lot of the land in Florida is under a consistent barrage of devastating weather for half the year. People still live there despite the semi regular evacuation notices and property damage, not to mention in some cases loss of life. It almost feels like this is a region that nature is telling people, ""Don't live here. It's not safe for you"" folks do live here though for various reasons: the allure of the coastal areas, financial reasons, lack of choice. 

Parts of Alaska would be a similar example. Like Utquiagvik (Barrow) which experiences polar night as well as isolation during the coldest months. 

Taking this concept into a scifi context and even pushing it into its most extreme implications, what are some examples of worlds in existing fiction or even ideas you could come up with that deal with issues like this. Whether it be for natives or colonists. 

For example maybe a tidally locked planet where the people have to live in large mobile cities that travel along with its rotation so they remain in the relatively temperate twilight region, but they also experience the risk of extreme storms from the dramatic temperature differentials. 

Maybe a very ocean heavy moon that experiences extreme tides due to the gravity of its parent planet or other moons orbiting in the same gravity well.

What are some other hazardous environments in which a scifi society could be forced to live? ",scifi
"""I'll be a pie-eyed emu!"" Re-reading Alfred Bester's 1942 story, ""The Push of a Finger""","[""The Push of a Finger][1] (free Gutenberg download) by Alfred Bester, was my second go at reading a story that I loved when I was 12 years old. I re-read it this past weekend, and very much enjoyed it. (Previously: [Revisiting a childhood favorite story: 'Dreams are Sacred' still delights][2].)

[1]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm
[2]: https://mitchw.blog/2024/10/01/i-had-a.html

As with ""Dreams Are Sacred,"" the Bester story is still entertaining. Like ""Dreams Are Sacred,"" the hero is a street-smart, wisecracking New York newspaperman with a brain in his head and abundant common sense. Published in 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction, ""The Push of a Finger"" is set a thousand years in the future, but the situations and language are straight out of a screwball comedy or noir movie from the 40s.

The hero is Carmichael, one of a dozen reporters for as many different newspapers assigned to the mysterious Prog Building in New York, where the technocrats who run the world issue pronouncements to preserve the Stability that has been the rule of civilization for centuries. The reporters are a brawling, fast-talking bunch, but they keep to their roles. By the rule of the Stability, every newspaper must have a balancing newspaper on the other side, and every decision by the ruling technocrats must be met by full-throated agreement by one newspaper and equal denunciation by its opposite number.

Carmichael finds a way to sneak into the mysterious Prog Building and discovers an event that will destroy the universe in a thousand years. ""The Push of a Finger"" has a similar gimmick to the far more famous [""The Sound of Thunder,""][3] by Ray Bradbury, which ran in the far more upscale Collier's magazine in 1952: The cataclysmic change in the future can be prevented by a trivial change in the present. Carmichael leads a team of technocrats in finding out what that minor, precipitating event is and stopping it.

[3]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61551/61551-h/61551-h.htm

I'm making the story sound more bombastic than it is. Bester was always a playful writer, fond of wordplay, absurdism and doggerel. In ""The Push of a Finger,"" a crowd of students at a demonstration chants

Neon  
Krypton  
Ammoniated  
FitzJohn

and that bit of verse has been stuck in my head for days. (And now it's stuck in yours. Um sorry I guess.)

Later, one of the characters exclaims, ""I'll be a pie-eyed emu!"" which proves to be important.

Bester seemed to be drinking from the same creative well as the Beats (Kerouac, Ginsberg, etc.), but a decade or two earlier, and pinning his writing to a scaffolding of pulp science fiction.

Bester's best-known novels were ""The Demolished Man"" (1953), a murder mystery in a society of telepaths, and ""The Stars My Destination"" (1956), a retelling of the Count of Monte Cristo in a society where people have the power to teleport from one location to another by sheer force of mind.

The politics of ""The Push of a Finger"" are typical of science fiction of the day and maybe of the U.S. at that time. The world of the future was going to be highly organized, centrally planned, and run by technocrats, just as the real world was at that time. It was 1942 -- World War II was raging, the Depression was just a few years earlier, and the great nations of the world were highly centralized machines governed by technocrats. Surely that would continue forever. That's the way Isaac Asimov wrote, and even Robert A. Heinlein, later an icon of libertarianism, featured centrally planned societies in his early stories, published at about this time.

I didn't talk abut racism and sexism in ""Dreams are Sacred"" and I don't have much to say about it here. Both stories are typical in that regard for pulp science fiction written and published in the 1940s. Race isn't mentioned, women are nearly in the background, LGBTQ and disabled people don't exist.

Something odd along those lines that I did notice: In the American pulps of the 40s and earlier, characters almost always had Anglo or European names: Carmichael, Pete Parnell, Steve Blakiston, etc. This was the norm back then, and I grew up in the 70s immersed in stories from that period and didn't think twice about it. But re-reading those stories today, the high percentage of Anglo names (and the missing women and nonwhite people and disabled and LGBTQ people) stands out to me as weird. I'm not saying this to condemn the writers of that era; they were living in their world just as I live in ours. But it's odd and unrealistic.

Bester was a giant of science fiction when I was a young fan in the 70s, and all science fiction fans then would have heard of him and most would have read him. Now I suspect he's nearly forgotten by anybody under 50. Sic transit [gloria mundi.][4]

Will AI Unlock Humanity's Greatest Secrets?,"We’ve all heard about AI being used for practical things—predicting the weather, diagnosing diseases, improving tech—but what if AI could do something much bigger? What if it could answer questions we've wrestled with since the dawn of time? Questions like: Are we alone? Is there a divine being? What happens after we die?





One part of the video that really stuck with me was the idea that AI might someday be able to reinterpret religious texts—across all faiths—and find connections or truths that we've completely missed. Can you imagine what would happen if AI pointed out contradictions in these texts, or found proof that some events or figures weren't what we thought they were? The ripple effects on global religion would be huge. Would people hold tighter to their faith, or would we see mass conversions to new beliefs based on AI's findings?

Even more fascinating (and a little eerie) was the suggestion that AI could uncover evidence of ancient extraterrestrial influence on human civilization. The video doesn’t just toy with this idea; it lays out the possibility that religions and myths could have been shaped by beings from other worlds. If that’s true, how would we even begin to reconcile that with everything we’ve been taught? Could AI end up guiding us into a new era of understanding where the lines between gods and aliens blur?

And then there’s the wildest part—what if AI could actually contact these advanced civilizations? It raises some intense questions about what our role is in the universe. Are we just a small part of a much larger cosmic story? And what would it mean if we found out we’ve been under the influence or guidance of something—or someone—not of this Earth all along?

Honestly, after watching this, I can't stop thinking about the possibilities. The video touches on so many deep philosophical and existential questions that I’ve never really considered, or at least not in this way. It made me wonder: If AI can offer us these kinds of insights, are we ready for what it might uncover? What does the truth even look like, and how much of it do we really want to know?

I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. How do you think people would react if AI started proving or disproving aspects of our history, faith, or even our origin story? Would society crumble under the weight of the truth, or would it lead to a whole new age of enlightenment?

If you haven’t watched the video yet, I highly recommend it. And once you do, let’s talk. I feel like there’s so much to unpack, and I need to know what others think.",scifi

The Morlock-Mutant parallel is obvious. Regressive evolution of mankind, devoid of humanity.

From there, we have:

(Martdegen)Main protagonist Bower: ""time-travels"" via hypersleep, dropped into an unforgiving, new world in the future. Spends much of the movie trying to save his wife, only to realize she is gone forever. Destroys the ship(Time Machine) in order to overcome evil and alter the future of humanity, saving everyone from being nothing more than cattle.

(Mara)Supporting protagonist Nadia: savvy, sheperd of life archetype. Saves our time-traveler and guides him in the new world. Implied at the end to become his new wife/partner.

(Morlock overlord)Main antagonist Payton: ""Creator/Leader"" of animalistic spawn of humanity's evil incarnate. Power hungry, nihilistic, maniac who views people as means to an end/food.

(Vox)The Cannibal: survivor tormented by circumstance and history. Provides context of what came to be to our protagonists.

(Mankind) Brings about its own downfall, reach exceeds our grasp.

(Time Machine) Vessel, plot driver. Must be destroyed in the end, as a means to correct humanity's path.

Also, Martdegen's friend. Symbolic of the basic instinct to fit in socially, as a survival mechanism. Shown by his adherence to ""bowler hat"" norms, and his general demeanor. Parallels the Morlock caste system, and at the end he tosses the hat, signifying hope for the future. This is echoed in Pandorum, by the crew that ultimately chose basic survival rather than overthrow Payton during his initial coup, and rise to power that set everything in motion.

I may have missed a couple points, but that's the gist of it as far as I'm concerned. I haven't watched Pandorum in a long time. I watched The Time Machine last night for the first time in at least ten years, and it dawned on me.",scifi

Space craft equivalent of a motorhome,"Hi. I don't know where to ask this. But I'm very curious.  
I've seen space craft in sci-fi that is equivalent of a fighter plane/vehicle, a big sea cruiser, a transport truck. However I've never seen anything equivalent to an motorhome.  
Say you need to make a  very long space road trip alone or with family, but you don't need a whole colony following you and self sustained farming space, but you need something bigger than a fighter to carry supplies and accommodations like bathroom, kitchen, bed to last for a few days. Or maybe the vehicle can be you mobile home, and you rely on space stations to top up supplies. A transport craft is the closest thing, but you want space for accommodation rather than cargo.  
Is there a word for that kind of space craft? And are there any examples in pop culture?  
Edit: Thanks for the replies. I had little access to popular Western sci-fi during my childhood, so the only space sci-fi I know is Star Wars original trilogy, and only a small amount of it. That's why I'm asking this to expand my knowledge now that I have relatively free internet access. No bait or any ill purpose.   
I have this idea because of the rising amount of single people living on motorhome in China, due to the rising housing cost. ",scifi
"Legion, Dark Matter (2015), Travelers, or something else entirely?","I'm looking for a new series, and these three seem to recommended quite a bit.

EDIT: Thanks for so much for all of your suggestions. I'm excited that so many people love all three!

Favorite/Most Unique forms of FTL Travel?,"I’ve been trying to make a list on various forms of FTL in fiction. So far, I have:
* Spatial compression/expansion
* Going to higher dimensions
* Dipping into a parallel dimension that either has no concept of distance, a vastly compressed distance, or with locations jumbled up
* Wormhole/Portal generators, either static or ship-mounted
* Tapping into a special energy/material/technique of some kind which deny’s the light speed barrier

I got these from: Star Trek [Warp Drive], Star Wars [Hyperdrive], Cytonic [The Nowhere], The Cosmere [The Cognitive Realm], Warhammer 40k [The Warp], Star Gate [Star Gates], Portal [The Portal Gun], DC [The Speed Force], Futurama [Dark Matter], A Wrinkle In Time [Tessering]

**Edit 1:** Cooked up some extra FTL categories from the responses so far, as well as some things I remembered:
* Spatial folding (different from spatial compression/expansion in that, instead of making the space the ship moves shorter, it connects the space that the ship is in to the space they want to go to. Difference between stretching a rubber band and folding a piece of paper)
* Probability/reality manipulation, moving from one place to another for literally no reason other than the fact that it’s now probable for it to happen
* Parallel universe swap, travel to an identical copy of your reality in the location you want to go to. The other you traveled to the location as well, just in your own original reality
* Gravity drive. I like to call this the Singularity Sled. The most common form works by generating a black hole at the front of the ship, pulling them forwards, but that also moves the black hole forwards, ad infinitum as its gravity drags it along. Other versions use artificial gravity instead
* Coordinate change, where through some means the ships coordinates are changed, as though through commands. Most likely reasons are that the ship is out of sync with normal reality, or it somehow ‘hacks’ into the universe
* Mass dampeners / Inertia preventers, messing with Newtons Laws to prevent deceleration and make acceleration easier
* Time manipulation, artificially altering the ships flow of time relative to the outside universe, making it appear to move faster than possible
* Size manipulation, growing towards your destination while shrinking the side that’s facing away, dragging it forward without actually moving
* Implosive/Explosive keyhole singularity, the ship implosively disappears, sucked into a keyhole singularity, to explosively reappear elsewhere
* Spatial swapping, swapping the contents of one space with another. Not to be confused with spatial folding, this actually exchanges the content of each space in full, not bringing disparate locations together

**Edit 2:** Here’s some more:
* Going to lower dimensions, ie 2D or 1D space
* Enlightenment/Unenlightenment, becoming one with everything then giving it up to drop your body anywhere
* Moving the universe around yourself, causing the illusions of movement without actually physically moving
* Making the universe ignore you, allowing you to break its laws for as long as it does
* Deconstructing/reconstructing yourself, the suicide booth option since the you that appears at the destination isn’t the same as the you that wanted to go there

**Edit 3:** Not a lot in this one:
* Interstellar highway, either a natural part of the universe or artificial construction that allows those within to travel some kind of FTL across its length, though only across its length, as its effects don’t extend past its borders
* Sympathetic, traveling through a representation or medium of some kind. Broader than it may sound, this includes things like traveling through shadows, jumping through a painting or hopping between gravity wells. The gist is go in one thing, come out another of the same type of thing/what that thing was portraying",scifi

Book Review: Dark Space by Rob Hart and Alex Segura,"TL;DR Review: A classic spy thriller…in space! Fast-paced, gripping, and intriguing.

**Full Review:**

*Dark Space* is the perfect book for fans of John Le Carre, a slow-burn yet quick-moving thriller that had me blazing through page after page to find out what the heck is going on.

From the beginning, it’s clear that things are NOT all right:

* Aboard the *Mosaic,* a colonizing ship hurtling through space toward a planet that is to be humanity’s hope of the future, pilot **Jose Carriles** suspects something is very much wrong when not one, not two, but *three* separate ship systems fail all at the same time. Worse, no one—not the captain nor the head engineer—seems interested in finding out.
* Back on New Destiny, humanity’s moon colony, **Corin Timony** receives a cryptic message from the *Mosaic,* only to have it immediately canceled. To top it off, she’d ordered to go home and forget about what she saw, only for a mysterious senator to push her to look into matters *and* for the only other person to see the *Mosaic’s* message to wind up dead.

Though light years and galaxies separate the two stories, it’s clear from the beginning that they are very much linked. Figuring out *how* is where the fun comes in.

The stakes are set from the very beginning, and the tension just gets ratcheted up with every new obstacle, enemy, discovery, and mystery. The pacing of each chapter is zippy enough to keep you wanting to read on—I said “just one more chapter” about a dozen times—and the hooks are baited so well that you’re drawn deeper and deeper.

I legitimately had knots in my shoulder as the story drew closer to revealing what the heck was going on, and even then, that’s just the beginning of MORE mystery, more suspense, more danger, and more challenges for the characters to overcome.

The action scenes were fun but short—this isn’t a Ludlum or Clancy thriller, but the sort that involves investigation over ass-kicking, problem-solving and people-handling over spaceship chases and gunfights.

But make no mistake: the book gives you all the excitement, intrigue, suspense, and exhilaration you could ask for. Atop that, the character work done into both Timony and Carriles was excellent, exploring their past screw-ups, present quagmires, and bleak futures in enough detail to make them easily relatable and grounded characters.

There’s even a bit of *Star Trek*-esque commentary on humanity woven nicely into the story. Through this adventure, we come face to face with both our flaws and fortes as a society. But by the ending, we’re shown a brighter way forward and left with a sense of hope that offers wonderful closure.

I enjoyed the hell out of this book—I read it in *one* day—and absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic spy thriller…but set in space!",scifi
"I just watched E3 of The X-Files reboot (if you don't want to discuss it, totally valid just please ignore my post, I just want to discuss it with people who also felt negatively about it, I'm not hating on anyone pls don't hate back)","EDIT okay REVIVAL not REBOOT sorry I had no idea the two terms were not interchangeable.   
  
Ok so lemme start off by saying that I JUST started watching the reboot. Yes, I've pretty much been living under a damn rock, I know, I'm VERY late to the game here and I already feel dumb, there's no need to rub salt in the wound.

Are there any other trans folks here who want to discuss the problematic nature of the episode?

And anyone want to discuss the ethical implications of continuing to watch it?

I felt like Guy Mann is just the coded projection of a chaser excusing their behavior, for one.

How based does that observation seem?

I'm kind of just sick about all of it. I grew up on The X-Files. I'm pretty damn disgusted with the portrayal of the trans woman in the episode, and with the misinfo and digs about GAC as well.

I'm reading the second book in the Encounter with Rama series. (Arthur C Clarke),"SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!

I fell in love with the first book, but the second one isn't doing it for me. From yesterday to today I read 200 pages, and I hate that reporter. Francesca, her name. And some male characters are so... Childish...

Francesca seems like an annoying sociopath, She is arrogant, inconvenient and overbearing, an eternal popular and mean teenager from North American movies.

Much of the book so far has been a dull, endless drama.  I fell in love with the alien ship, the mystery, and the speculation of their civilization's capabilities. We also don't know where they're from, whether they're alive or dead... I've come to think that the ships are relics, that they've finally abandoned generational travel and discovered more advanced ways of visiting the stars.

This is my opinion, do you recommend that I continue reading? I've read a lot of people saying that they hated the other books.

JAA'ABANI:2120 is  an adult cyberpunk sci-fi novel set 100 years in the future. 

Texas has seceded the union and become a mecca for white supremacists. After a century of war, environmental strife, and 'the 2nd dark age,' the New Reich is the leading world power via control of the insidious Animus Civitas technology--a simulation that mesmerizes the mind while drawing energy from your physical nervous system. Millions languish in 'the Siv' while their families watch their bodies wither in the Real, caught hopelessly in indentured-streaming contracts to the richest influencers of the New Reich. A new hero, the last Heir-Architect, finally joins the Siv and begins a war to defend all people stuck in mental slavery. Mayhem and monstrosity takes hold of the simulation when a serial-killer begins recreating crimes from the past, their victims inexplicably dying in the Real--their corpses set in a twisted grin that is the killer's grisly calling card.​

Sci fi books that read like character focused fantasy for a beginner looking to get into the genre? ,"
I am interested in reading Sci fi, specially space opera, but from what I have gathered from friends that do read scifi is that it's (Very generally) a genre focused on cool, deep, interesting or innovative ideas and themes, and characters take a secondary role. Of course, I haven't read any Sci fi books and I don't know all of them, so I want recommendations. 

I am interested in a good story with great characters, it can involve war, politics, exploration etc, maybe akin to halo or mass effect.  I would prefer if the books were either modern or not too difficult to get into. I know nothing of Scifi so please recommend me anything, even if it seems the most obvious answer. 

I would also prefer if they were more mature books and not YA, which isn't my cup of tea. The only books I know of are Dune and Gideon the Ninth (Which I haven't read but got them on my list). ",scifi

Rendezvous with Rama film adaptation - soundtrack idea,"Now that Denis Villeneuve is going to direct the cinematographic adaptation of Rendezvous with Rama, I wanted to share something that happened to me while reading the book that I think would be amazing to have in the film. 

I read most of the book during my commute to/from work, and for the most part while also listening to music on my headphones. By mere chance, while I was reading the part where the astronauts enter Rama for the first time, the song that was playing was Welcome to the Machine by Pink Floyd. And... Damn, I think there are very few songs that match so perfectly with a book or film sequence. From the slow and mysterious pace and mechanic ambient sounds, to the lyrics! The first verse starts with:

Welcome my son,
Welcome to the machine.
Where have you been?
It's alright we know where you've been

That's basically and without spoilers the plot of the whole book (and sequels). 

So yeah it was pretty cool to have such an inmersive moment, but now I wanted to throw a long shot and ask: is there any way in which maybe, just maybe, I could reach Denis about this? I guess they will make a soundtrack for that moment but honestly it will be difficult to come up with something better...",scifi

Ancient internet ,"Let’s say a million years from now after the tech has been forgotten if they “discovered” the internet or recreated it would all the information still be there? And if so could there have been like an ancient internet? I’ve heard of the Akashic records so maybe that was just an ancient form of data storage and transfer similar to our internet? Would we be able to search for some kind of lost data storage?

Edit: okay so a million years is not feasible, let’s say 100000. And our modern computers use binary code and cheap forms of memory. If in ancient times they had  a device that translated data off of similar forms then it too would not exist anymore. So let’s say they used crystal skullls as the storage device and powered it using an unknown source (natural nuclear reactors have existed on earth) and didn’t use magnetism. If there was such a device and was left powered (kinda getting into stargate territory here) then there might be a possibility of accessing it? I get that our internet is pretty limited and would not survive without human interaction the entire time, that seems a little cocky of humanity and I feel that even the ancient world would have understood the volatility of our current internet and would have created something more permanent. Even we are currently trying to archive the internet. ",scifi
Terminator Zero - Worth continuing after episode 3?,"So I was loving this series until episode 3. I thought it was a really great spin on the Terminator story and I was digging all the characters and story beats. Then I watched episode 3 and it completely tanked the series, thus far, for me. 

The Terminator is so weak and stupid, and Eiko's plot armour is so ridiculously thick that it has destroyed all tension and stakes for me. 

My issues are as follows:
- Reika was trapped in an enclosed space with the Terminator. There was no way she should have been able to escape. The fact that she did makes the Terminator look stupid.
- The Terminator severely injured Eikod. It would have been the work of a moment to finish her off and neutralise a threat. 
- The Terminator smashed Eikod in the back, multiple times. Eikod should be dead, her bones smashed into pulp.
- After failing to smash Eikod's back to pieces, Eikod then overpowers a FREAKING TERMINATOR and pushes it down the elevator shaft!

I've heard people defend this stuff as, well it's just anime logic. However, I don't recall a Titan ever smashing Levi in the back and then Levi just casually overpowering the Titan to push it off a mountain or something in Attack in Titan. Levi getting smashed in the back by a Titan and then just casually overpowering it to push it off a mountain, without any equipment, is the equivalent of what has happened in this show in episode 3.

Sure, Eikod fighting a Terminator on the end of a rope in episode 1 was a bit silly. Also Eikod running up a falling truck to safety in episode 2 is a bit silly. Hell, Eikod kicking and punching the Terminator in episode 3 is very silly, she would break her hands and feet. Still, I could just about apply anime logic to that stuff and suspend my disbelief that far. But the Terminator smashing Eikod in the back multiple times and then Eikod not only walking away, but actually overpowering the Terminator is just too much.

Yeah, Reika, Eikod and everyone else were always going to beat the Terminator but it needed to happened within the rules if the universe. Once those rules are broken, there a no stakes or tension. Episode 3 shattered those rules with a Terminator punch to the back. There doesn't feel like there is any tension because there is nothing the Terminator can do to win, he is too weak and stupid. In contrast, Eikod is far to overpowered to lose. Real shame, because I was really enjoying it up until episode 3.

So genuine question to people who have watched the rest of the series. Is it worth watching episode 4 and beyond, or should I just quit now? (No spoilers or as light as possible, for episode 4 and beyond please.)

Edit: So, I did watch the rest of Terminator Zero. I am glad that I did, as I think the story was fantastic. The Terminator is still quite weak and stupid but never as egregiously so, as in episode 3, again. Ironically, the best bits of this Terminator series was when the Terminator wasn't actually in it. The story moments, character arcs and time travel shenanigans are actually kind of fun. The series certainly gets you thinking about alternate timelines! Unfortunately, the Terminator never really becomes a credible threat, apart from MAYBE at the very end, (by which point the damage is already done to his character), which is a shame. Weak and stupid Terminator aside, I'd say this was actually a pretty good series.",scifi

could we build a spaceship from iron pyrite,"I was watching some videos about the Baltic Sea anomaly which is basically a stone feature at the bottom of the Baltic sea that resembles the millennium falcon but made out of stone. I went on a rabbit hole about whether we could build a spaceship out of stone, which could be possible with use of an asteroid but the type of stone used would have to be something non porous and even if you could find an asteroid of granite and hollow it out and shape the outside to look however you want it to, it would be ridiculously heavy and unrealistic to be able to have engines that could move it. So I though can refined metal petrify into a stone like wood? And yes it can. So what if we used iron pyrite to make a spaceship?

Spaceship Names In Non-English Sci-Fi?,"Hey folks,

I'm running a sci-fi ttrpg, and so, just as a fun exercise, I started making a list of spaceship names that I can dip into in the future. It's going well, and I've got some great ones, but I started realizing that they're all in English. The people in my setting don't speak English, at least not exclusively, so I thought it would be a good idea to get some ship names from other languages interspersed in there.

But then I realized, I haven't seen many examples of that! The only one that comes to mind is the \*Y Que\* from the Expanse - absolutely rad ship name, by the way. So, I thought I'd ask all of you.

Specifically this question is geared toward sci-fi fans whose first language is not English, and who read a lot of non-English sci-fi (although if that doesn't fully apply to you, feel free to chime in). What are spaceship naming conventions in your linguistic corner of sci-fi? What are some of your favorite ship names?

Edit: to be clear, I'm not looking for real spacecraft names, or how it's done in English; I'm asking how sci-fi authors, who write in languages other than English, name spaceships. If you're a sci-fi fan whose primary language is not English, you're who I'm mostly looking for.",scifi

|Andromeda|This one will probably be a bit controversial due to the main actor being Kevin Sorbo, but Andromeda was pretty decent. Basically it's about a captain and his AI controlled spaceship being ""thrown"" into the future, where the galaxy-spanning government he was a part of was gone, and the various inhabited planets and systems became a lot more tribal.

Could you help me find a sci-fi horror short story I read once when I was a child?,"This happened in Catalonia at some point between 2008-2011.

In my school we had a library, and every class had a shelf with some books from said library. The books where changed every so often. A few days per year the teachers would have us pick a book and read it for the entirety of the hour.

The only book I remember reading from this was a sci-fi horror antology book. I picked because it specifically had a space theme going on in the cover and/or title, and I thought that was interesting. All the stories on it were somewhat sci-fi, and I think all of them were horror, but I'm not 100% sure on this last part.

I think it had like 3 stories only (again, not 100% sure). It was a short book, I think it was aimed for children. Definitely nothing gore. One story had a futuristic restaurant as the setting, I think?

Either way, I'm really interested in only one story in particular, the only one I really remember. It was about a space crew who went to the Moon (I'm fairly sure it was the Moon). They might've been a permanent expedition there, I don't know. Either way, everyone on the crew goes back to Earth for some reason except the protagonist, who stays on the moon to keep maintenance in the lunar base or something like that. And in the absolute loneliness of the Moon, he starts noticing strange things. Shadows moving in the corners of his eyes, things aren't where he remembers leaving them. The story goes on about the tasks he's got to do on the Moon and his day to day life, but the strangeness keeps increasing in scale and frequency, and at some point in the story, it's very clear there's *something* out there. But the protagonist doesn't know what. He looks all around the shuttle and the base, he doesn't find anything nor anyone. He never manages to see the thing, he only catches glimpses of a shadow. The story ends with the protagonist going back to Earth and, on the rocket, he looks down to the Moon through the windows one last time. And he, once again, catches a shadow in the corner of his eye, only for it to be gone once he realizes it.

We the reader never get to see the thing or to even know *if* there really was a thing or not. It's a great concept, isn't it? It has stayed on my mind for all these years because of that. I'd like to reread it again, but I don't know the name of the story or its author.

Because this was in Catalonia this means the story could have been from a Catalan author and originally written in Catalan (I did read it in Catalan), or a story originally written in Spanish by a Spanish or Latinoamerican author, or a story from anywhere in the world translated into Catalan. I don't have a clue. I think it's probable the stories were American short sci-fi stories from the 60s or 70s which were translated and compiled into an anthology book, and that's what I'm hoping for, because if it was a local production I don't think I'll be able to find it.

Does anyone recognize this story?",scifi

Recently watched Prospect. It's probably my favourite sci-fi film - is there anything else out there like it?,"What I loved about it and what I want more of:

-The space western vibe
-The practical effects with that retro/ analogue look and minimal flashy CGI. They really made me feel like the world was lived in.
-The below the surface world building that left me with a sense that the universe had a huge amount depth that let my imagination run rampant.
-Great, believable characters 
-Interesting slow burn story about interesting characters acting like humans. No flashy marvelesque bloated action scenes. 
-The amount of love that obviously went into making it
-The tiny budget and how amazing and real it all looked. 

More films on a similar vein would be great. Books too, even comics (although I'm not a comic guy) cheers!",scifi

Modern Sci fi fandom needs to stop thinking it is political,"Now I am well aware that sci fi fandom is not a monolith. There are different levels. You get people who just like sci fi and that's that, then you get people who join clubs to meet up with other fans, write fanfics, collect figures, books, comics etc all of which are obviously fine and form the backbone of the genres fandom.

However sadly these types of fans are almost always overlooked in the media and by the industry for career fans, people who ironically might not even be that big fans in real life, but who see a potential career in the genre. They shill for big companies, run toxic websites like Den of Geek, The Mary Sue, run official magazines, become little commandants of official forums, or boast about how nerdy they are on their podcasts like Chris Hardwick did before his fall from grace, host after show podcasts where they schmooze with the actors and writers etc.

Sadly in many circles, the career fans who see themselves as the elite are often able to shape the narrative and whip people up into cliques and groups because their opinions are given the widest reach in the media. This has been a problem since I'd say at least the 1980s. Colin Baker, a former Doctor Who even mentions that shows fandom getting in his own words ""far too top heavy"" in the 80s.

Within the last ten years however this problem has become worse than ever thanks to the introduction of identity politics, which has allowed the elitist, career fans to bully those they don't like by smearing them as racists, incels etc. This kind of behavior has in turn led to another huge clique forming in response, the anti identity politics, anti woke, anti SJW mob, who have sadly developed their own elite who just want to take over from the current clique but would be no better.

Most hilariously of all however the majority of people in both cliques ESPECIALLY the leading media figures as it were aren't actually political. The politics part was just a tool used by the opportunists on both sides to whip people up and was a very shallow form of identity politics that has no bearing on either real left or right wing politics. (For the record I would identify as an old school lefty, NOT a centrist. However you don't have to be a centrist to see what's going on here.)

Identity and neoliberal politics are shallow, bastardisations of left wing politics, that are pushed by upper middle class poseurs who want to look cool and lefty, but are too stupid, shallow or scared to fight for genuine left wing causes. Or alternatively they can be pushed by elitists to cover their own twisted, bigoted actions. ""How can Tony Blair be a right wing traitor. Sure he backed the most right wing President of all time in invading another country for its oil, and his government undermined the NHS and Thatcher said New Labour was her greatest legacy, but he has x amount of women in his cabinet via the Blair babes so he must be progressive."" Same with Barack ""drone king"" Obama who destroyed Libya but was seen as progressive simply for being the first black man to become President.

People USED to make a distinction between these types and actual lefties. Frank Zappa was a lefty who wrote vicious attacks against American Imperialism, but was equally scathing of the phony Hippies who embodied this type of shallow politics in the 60s. The Who's Don't Get Fooled Again perfectly sums these people up, and Rick a character from The Young Ones a classic British comedy took the piss out of these kinds of lefties (with Rik Mayall who played him being a lefty himself.) However somewhere in the 90s-00s people started to see the left as actually being like this, which sadly allowed the neo liberal, identity politics crowd to rope more people in.

Incredibly enough a kind of right wing identity politics soon formed in response, focusing on white male identity, and valuing women and black people who sided with the conservatives like Candace Owens etc. Like I said it's these types of politics that were used by the main media figures in both cliques that are currently destroying the sci fi fandom and genres.

Most normal people in the fandom have been sucked in because maybe they have a few things they genuinely care about, and whichever side is genuinely talking about them will seem like their people and before they know it they are part of that tribe and have to go along with everything it says and often will without knowing it.  Or maybe didn't want to get involved in either side, but the result is the same.

Very few people in general are actually political. I'm not saying I am a political scientist or anything LOL or that those who are not political are stupid. Very few of us, me included have time for politics, as we have real world problems, working 9-5 jobs, looking after kids or sick loved ones, and the free time we do have, we devote to our actual hobbies.

It's a shame as we all, myself included could do with knowing more, but still politics is a complicated subject that really needs a lot of your time to understand. Same is true of any subject, including sci fi.

Things like more female heroes, or even are politics taking over sci fi stories too much are valid talking points for sci fi fans meanwhile that don't require huge political knowledge, and genre fans should realise that they can talk about them without this kind of identity politics left/right tribalism sneaking in.

In order for that to happen rather than call one side MARXISTS or another side FAR RIGHTERS which empowers them as it does make them look political. We need to instead tell both sides if they try and bring that shit in.

***""You know fuck all about politics. You really aren't fit to talk about this incredibly complex subject. Either you're a snake oil salesman/woman wanting to rile us up, or you've been misled by one. Want to talk about the actual genre we're supposed to be talking about, go ahead. Otherwise no. You're neither left nor right. You don't have enough knowledge of either actual conservative or left wing politics to form an opinion on either so stop bringing your bastardisation of both into these franchises.""***

Of course I'm sure some sci fi fans will be genuinely political LOL, but most of the time and again certainly the ""dominant voices in the media"" and even on forums? No. They don't have a political bone in their bodies, and their analysis and opinions about things from a political perspective are always at best mind meltingly shallow, at worst toxic and hypocritical. Don't believe me? Look at this.

The so called ""lefty"" side of fandom regularly ruins people, yet protects far worse scum in the industry if they happen to voice the same shallow opinions IE belong to their tribe. Until recently Neil Gaiman was a shining example of this. Others include Neil Patrick Harris, who created a cake to resemble Amy Winehouse's rotting corpse a few weeks after she died and showed it online, but has received NO backlash as he's in with the bricks.

The treatment of Gina Carano on the other hand for not being completely a part of this tribe in contrast is nothing short of disgraceful. (okay I know this is a bit of an obsession of mine and I won't spend too long here so as to not derail the thread, but it is a perfect example.)

She was fired for mild opinions and smeared as a transphobe and a Nazi for them (Which honestly did remind me of Rik from the Young Ones ""Have you had enough Nazi or do you want some more?"". ""Neil are these lentils South African? YOU BASTARD YOU UTTER BASTARD I SUPPOSE YOU HATE GAY PEOPLE TOO HIPPIE!"")

Meanwhile she has endured horrific sexism in the industry and these so called feminists not only ignore it, they take the side of the perverts she's against just because it is her and she's in their simple view, the other tribe.

On the set of Deadpool its makers tried to force Gina to get her tits out on camera and threatened to fire her if she didn't. They actually DID fire her eventually, and put pressure on her even afterwards, saying it would hurt her career if she didn't get the girls out. Her own agent by the way also took their side and tried to pressure her to get her tits out.

Basically this is what Gina was subject to.

[https://youtu.be/Qx\_CTBI542M](https://youtu.be/Qx_CTBI542M)

Fortunately as she had filmed lots of scenes already they had to eventually rescind their decision and keep her on, but she was cut from the sequel as a result. The lefty side meanwhile gloated over the recent release of Deadpool and Wolverine to Gina on social media saying ""haha this bitch could have been in it and she blew another franchise."" If she were on their side, they'd call her story an inspiring ME TOO moment.

Meanwhile in her case against Disney, the company has hired Daniel M Petrocelli to crush Gina's lawsuit. This is a man who got Harvey Weinstein off with raping women by threatening his victims in secret. He threatened one physically and said he'd slut shame and humiliate another in court and bribed others saying he didn't care if his client was innocent, money talks. THIS is who Disney have hired to crush Gina, with a female Democrat voting judge ruling that Disney most likely fired Gina and smeared her to distract from their own dodgy dealings, hence why it has gone to discovery. Yet these sites like The Mary Sue still root for Disney and the people who have been misled by them do too? They take the side of a rape enabler over a strong woman, fired for speaking her mind and call themselves feminists? I think that alone demonstrates that they have 0 to offer politically.

Also look at the so called lefty reaction to the first Joker film? Calling that an Incel fantasy based solely on the fact that it had a white male as the lead who was disenfranchised. That's it, that's how deep that went. At no point does Arthur ever express hatred for women, or show anger that women don't like him. Ironically the woman he imagines a relationship with he doesn't harm when he finds out it is in his head. Furthermore ALL his victims and tormentors barring his mother who is mentally ill and almost not responsible for her actions are violent, elitist, rich, or toxic, macho in some cases conservative white men.

Joker is actually a proper left wing movie that looks at how privatisation of health care is strangling western society, as Arthur could have been helped but was kicked to the curb, how the elites look down on those at the bottom with Thomas Wayne having an Ayn Randian view of the poor as not working as hard as he did, how mental health problems are stigmatized in the way people mistreat Arthur and calls out bullying culture brilliantly when Murray shows Arthur having a melt down on tv and humiliates him.

The treatment that Arthur gets from Murray actually reminds me of the unkind, misogynistic treatment Amy Winehouse got ironically from the same media that demonised this film. Let's see both Amy and Arthur have mental health problems that cause people to view them as freaks who deserve to be humiliated? Both went on stage and their mental health problems caused it to be a disaster (in the case of Amy's last concert in Belgrade.) In both cases that humiliation wasn't enough and some little shit recorded them breaking down as a result of severe mental health struggles and showed it off to the rest of the world to laugh at them, and in both cases we kept wanting more of them after, just to sneer at them. (The press following Amy in the hopes she'd have a melt down, Arthur being invited on Murray's show.) Also Murray humiliating Arthur and then virtue signalling serves as a good representation of people like Frankie Boyle who used to laugh at and sneer and bully Amy and others, but now when it is convenient have reinvented themselves as woke.

Yet the Mary Sue and all these other stupid sites called it an Incel movie and ironically praised Deadpool, a movie whose makers are frat boy misogynists that make jokes about Gina Carano being fat, try and threaten her career to get a look at her big juicy boobs and speaking of Amy Winehouse, take a look at this joke they wanted to do about her when again it was trendy to bully her in misogynistic ways and because of her mental health.

[https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-amy-winehouse/](https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-amy-winehouse/)

Yeah Deadpool DOES actually represent an extremely misogynistic sub culture, that obnoxious fratboy mentality of only valuing women based on if they are hot ""Of course we'll hire you Gina, but only if you show us your wazzo pair of jugs, let's demote Morena Baccarin's role, a big character from the comics down to a pretty face with not much else to do, oh Amy's such an ugly skank, let's laugh at her misfortune."" Yet again these stupid feminist sites and lefty's had 0 problems with that and salivated over Deadpool, yet smeared Joker that actually called out this behavior as the movie for incels. How can you ever trust them to call out misogyny or even just to let you know which movies are good ones for talking about leftist issues with this in mind?

The other side however are no better. To start with they have their official demons the way the lefty side does with Gina. Women like Brie Larson, that chick who is in the Snow White film etc are hated to an insane degree for what are still mild opinions and absolutely would be blacklisted like Gina if this side had the power and who knows maybe in a few years they will?

For the record yeah I think Brie Larson's comments about white men were thick as pig shit, but I'm not going to follow her around to every project she is a part of, look for dirt on her, or make out her co-stars hate her because of the way one of them looks in a video and make hundreds of vids about how much I despise her for it like the other side does. How many fucking videos can they make saying the same thing with the same thumbnail for the Snow White chick?

I'm so fucking fed up of the way some actors names can't be mentioned on forums for fear of it inciting a stupid political debate on both sides. David Tennant is also falling into the Brie Larson category for the right side too. I suggested him for Cletus Kasady/Carnage on a fan cast and got lots of shit about how he's a woketurd, NOTHING about his acting, or suitability for the actual role I suggested. Similarly when I suggested Gina Carano for Xena on Reddit I ended up in a debate about whether she was a Nazi shit stain on the arse of humanity, rather than........... Xena!

Did you guys know Christopher Lee was an old Tory? That Donald Sutherland was a rabid Marxist? Imagine that. Would you have liked it if both actors careers were sidelined and we never got to see them in great roles like Dracula or Don't Look Now because of a bunch of infantile self righteous twats online who don't actually have any understanding of either ideology?

Furthermore a lot of these anti woke mob guys like Nerdrotic actually think people like Chris Chibnall, J J Abrams, and companies like Disney are Marxist. NONE of them have the first clue about what Marxism is clearly. The very idea that fucking Disney is a left wing company is a joke. Again a genuine right winger wouldn't come to that conclusion. Only a tribal ""Disney are the side I hate"" would.

I remember seeing a video where the Critical Drinker a popular anti sjw youtuber went on about how socialism is only for weak men, men who can't think for themselves, men who like to be dominated etc. To start with, grow the fuck up. He might as well have said ""our side has all the cool people."" Second of all even if you want to play it by that mantra, I hardly think that the Critical Drinker is more of a man than the Red Army who fought the Nazis in horrific conditions. Just saying?

Also that side as it likes to appeal to young men DOES have a nasty misogynistic streak too. There was a video Nerdrotic and his friends relentlessly tormented a woman named Frosk, by having their friend dress up as her and go on about how unfuckable and ugly she was. Again very nuanced, and thoughtful way to own a feminist. Clearly Nerdrotic and his ilk have 0 to offer politically considering he couldn't even take down someone like Frosk who was an idiot without resorting to nasty schoolyard bullying tactics.

Normally of course these two sides warring with each other wouldn't bother me, except for the fact that in both cases, as the loudest voices over just normal, everyday sci fi fans, I fear they are actually shaping the genre.

People will ALWAYS say ""oh they are just losers online, nobody cares about what they think."" Sorry but that's bullshit and how they get away with it. Companies think these people DO represent what the general public want, they are getting actors like Gina fired, writers blacklisted, shaping the direction of series and taking over any proper discussion about these things to be about their shallow politics rather than genre stories themselves. Look at Doctor Who for instance? When I was a boy its fandom used to be about what is the best monster, story and so on. Now? It's a pissing contest for everybody's political hang ups.

Also take a look at this recent article about how fans will now be brought in as creative consultants for these kinds of movies.

[https://comicbookmovie.com/sci\_fi/star-wars/major-studios-are-assembling-superfan-focus-groups-in-an-effort-to-combat-online-backlash-a213690](https://comicbookmovie.com/sci_fi/star-wars/major-studios-are-assembling-superfan-focus-groups-in-an-effort-to-combat-online-backlash-a213690)

A bad idea overall, but what's the betting in both cases it will be made up of people from both sides of these cliques further turning it into a pissing contest?

Like I said it's high time rather than being called far righters or Marxists, actual sci fi fans fought back and told these people to get off their high horses and stop acting as though they are political scientists when they haven't the first fucking clue about anything even remotely political at all.

"Small budget, great film: ""Parallel"" (2024)","It's rare that a movie really captivates me from the first minute to the last. “Parallel” has managed it.

From a calm, almost relaxing atmosphere, drama and suspense develop faster and faster without losing their rhythm. The movie is a chamber play with only 3 characters (or maybe a lot more...?), and it's about the multiverse. I've never seen a complex topic of this kind realized so well - without any CGI.

Recommendation wanted,"I’m about to finish the last book of the Bobiverse, and am looking for the next thing. 
Books/series I couldn’t put down:
- all of William Gibson (except The Difference Engine collab)
- Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy
- LOTR (not sci-fi, obvs)
- The Expanse series
- most of Neal Stephenson (loved Snow Crash and Anathem, meh on Seveneves, Reamde, Dodge, and Dodo, hard no on Baroque)
- Hyperion series
- Earthseed


I grew up on paperback anthologies of short stories by all of the early 20th century’s greats, so I’ve read most of those.  (Asimov, Clarke, Van Vogt, del Rey, etc.)

Suggestions?

TIA",scifi
Hellboy The crooked man,"I don't know how many  have seen it, but it's surprisingly good for something that looks like a TV film.
